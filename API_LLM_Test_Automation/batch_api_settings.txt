API_PROMPT="Analyze the following user session log and determine whether it represents a Conversion or a Drop-Off. Each core event (Login, Registration, Add to Cart, Place Order, etc.) counts as a Conversion if it was successfully completed at least once. If an event failed initially but was retried and completed successfully, it is still a Conversion. If a user started an event but never completed it successfully or stopped after a failed attempt, it is a Drop-Off. If at least one event was completed successfully and no unrecovered failures remain, classify it as Conversion. Format your response as follows:

Tag: Conversion || Drop-Off [Reason]

[Step 1]

[Step 2]

[Step 3] …"
