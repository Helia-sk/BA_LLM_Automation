==================================================

1) Identify the user action that indicates the start of the session.
    - In this case, it is the "form_submit.v2" event with the URL "/restaurant/login". This indicates the user has started a new session by logging in.

2) Determine if there are any subsequent actions indicating a drop-off or conversion.
    - After the login, the user navigates to "/restaurant/dashboard/history", which suggests they have successfully logged in and are now interacting with the application.

3) Identify the final user action that indicates the end of the session.
    - There is no clear indication of the user logging out or leaving the site, so we can assume the session is still active at the time the log ends.

4) Based on the analysis, make a decision about whether this was a drop-off or a conversion.
    - Since the user has interacted with the application after login and there is no clear indication of them leaving the site, we can conclude that this session was not a drop-off but a conversion.

Tag: Conversion
[The user logged in and interacted with the application, indicating a successful session.]
