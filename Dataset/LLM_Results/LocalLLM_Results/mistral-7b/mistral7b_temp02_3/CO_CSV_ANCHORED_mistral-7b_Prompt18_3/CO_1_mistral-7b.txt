==================================================

1) Identify the user interaction events in the log file.
    - The user navigates to the customer login page (click event on "Customer Login").
    - The user clicks on the username input field.
    - The user types "User1" into the username input field and moves focus away from it (input change event).
    - The user clicks on the password input field.
    - No further user interaction events are recorded after this point.

2) Determine if the session was a drop-off or a conversion.
    - A conversion typically involves completing a desired action, such as submitting a form or making a purchase. In this case, no such action is observed in the log file.
    - The user navigated to the login page and entered their username but did not proceed with entering their password or submitting the form. This suggests that the session was a drop-off.

Tag: Drop-off [The user did not complete the login process]
