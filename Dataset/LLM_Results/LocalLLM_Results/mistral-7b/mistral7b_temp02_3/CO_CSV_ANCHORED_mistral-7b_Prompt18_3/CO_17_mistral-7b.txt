==================================================

 Tag: Drop-off
   1) The user first visited the homepage (/customer/dashboard), clicked on "Restaurants".
   2) After clicking "Restaurants", the user navigated to the Restaurant page (/customer/dashboard/restaurant/9).
   3) On the Restaurant page, the user scrolled down and clicked on an image area where no image was available.
   4) The user then scrolled back up and scrolled again, but did not interact with any other elements on the page.
   5) The user left the page (/customer/dashboard/restaurant/9) without performing any further actions or navigating to another page.
   Since the user did not perform any action that would indicate a purchase or engagement with the content, it is likely that this session was a drop-off.
