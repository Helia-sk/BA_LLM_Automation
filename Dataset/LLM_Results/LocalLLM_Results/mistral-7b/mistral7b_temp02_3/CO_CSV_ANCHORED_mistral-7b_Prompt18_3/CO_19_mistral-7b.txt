==================================================

1) Analyzing the log file, we can see that the user first navigated to the homepage (`/`) at `2025-09-27T14:18:55.683Z`.

2) Next, the user clicked on the "Customer Login" button located at `x=1659, y=19` which navigated to the customer login page (`/customer/login`) at `2025-09-27T14:19:05.841Z`.

3) After that, we can see multiple interactions with the login form on the customer login page, such as clicking and typing into the username input field. However, there is no log entry indicating a successful login or navigation to another page, which suggests that the user did not complete the login process.

4) Since the user navigated to the login page but did not complete the login process, this session can be considered a drop-off.

Tag: Drop-off [The user did not complete the login process]
