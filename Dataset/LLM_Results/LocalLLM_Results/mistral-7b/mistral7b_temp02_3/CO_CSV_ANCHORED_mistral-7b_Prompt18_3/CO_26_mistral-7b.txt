==================================================

1) Identify the user interaction events in the log file.
    - The user clicks on the menu items (Starters, Main Courses, Desserts, Drinks, Side Dishes).
    - The user clicks on "Add Item".
    - No further interaction events are recorded after clicking "Add Item", indicating that the user did not perform any other actions before leaving the page.

2) Determine if the session was a drop-off or a conversion.
    - Since no interaction event related to completing an order or making a purchase is recorded, it can be assumed that the user did not complete a transaction (conversion).
    - However, the user showed interest in the menu items by clicking on them, which suggests that they were engaged and potentially considering placing an order. This could be considered a drop-off, but with a higher likelihood of potential conversion if follow-up actions are taken to engage the user further (e.g., sending a reminder or offering a discount).

Tag: Drop-off [User showed interest in menu items but did not complete a transaction]
