==================================================

 Tag: Drop-off
   1) The user navigated to the restaurant dashboard page (/restaurant/dashboard). This is the first interaction in the session.
   2) The user clicked on the "History" link, indicating they are interested in viewing the order history.
   3) The user clicked on a specific order detail, suggesting they wanted more information about an order. However, after clicking on the "View Details" button, there is no subsequent interaction or navigation to another page, indicating that the user did not complete any further actions.
   4) The user closed the details view by clicking on the "X" button, and there are no additional interactions in the session.
   Since the user did not perform any actions that could be considered a conversion (e.g., placing an order, contacting the restaurant), we can conclude that this was a drop-off session.
