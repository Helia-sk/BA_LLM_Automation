==================================================

1) The first step is to identify the user's actions in the log file.
2) The user navigates to the customer login page, clicks on the "Customer Login" button.
3) Upon clicking the "Customer Login" button, the user is redirected to the input fields for username and password.
4) The user interacts with the username input field by clicking on it and typing in a value ("user1").
5) The user then interacts with the username input field again, indicating that they may be correcting or changing their input.
6) No further actions related to the password input field are recorded, suggesting that the user did not proceed with the login process.
7) Based on the lack of a password entry and no subsequent actions indicating a successful login, it appears that this session was a drop-off.

Tag: Drop-off [The user navigated to the login page but did not complete the login process by entering a password.]
