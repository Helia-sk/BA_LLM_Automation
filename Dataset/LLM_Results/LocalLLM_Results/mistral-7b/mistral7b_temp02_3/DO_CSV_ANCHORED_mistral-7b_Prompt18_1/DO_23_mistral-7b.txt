==================================================

1) Identify the user interaction events in the log file.
    - The user navigates to the login page (log_1757766617577_cr4q0wxnm).
    - The user clicks on the username input field (log_1757766618638_s2xelfslo and log_1757766617577_yfqyt19cq).
    - The user types "User1" into the username input field (log_1757766617577_yfqyt19cq, log_1757766618638_wzsha5ajf, and log_175776618638_arwesjyp6).
    - The user clicks on the password input field (log_1757766621191_h6hkqa012 and log_1757766621619_yvxg4evay).
    - The user types a password, but it is not shown in the log file.
    - The user clicks on the login button (not shown in the log file).

2) Determine if the session was a drop-off or a conversion.
    - Since the user clicked on the login button but did not submit any password, we cannot confirm whether the user has successfully logged in or not.
    - However, the user interacted with the username and password fields, which indicates that they were trying to log in.
    - Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that this session was a drop-off rather than a conversion.

Tag: Drop-off [The user clicked on the login button but did not submit any password.]
