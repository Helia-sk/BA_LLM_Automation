 Tag: Drop-off
   1) The user navigated to the login page (/restaurant/login), indicating they are trying to access a specific feature of the application.
   2) After clicking on the "Restaurant Login" button, no further interaction or navigation events were recorded in the log file.
   3) Since there is no evidence of successful login or any subsequent actions that would indicate a conversion (e.g., navigating to the dashboard), it appears that the user dropped off at this point.
