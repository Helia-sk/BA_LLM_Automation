==================================================

1) Identify the user interaction events in the log file.
    - The user navigates to the login page (/restaurant/login).
    - The user clicks on the "Register your restaurant or log in to manage orders" link, indicating an intent to interact further with the application.
    - The user enters a username ("User1") and does not navigate away from the page.
    - The user clicks on the username input field, suggesting they might be preparing to enter a password. However, no password entry is recorded in the log file.
    - The user clicks on the password input field but does not enter any password.
    - The user clicks on the login button (implied by the click event on the password input field), but no subsequent events are logged, indicating that the user did not complete the login process and may have dropped off.

2) Determine if the session was a drop-off or a conversion.
    - Since the user did not complete the login process (no password entry or subsequent events recorded after the click on the login button), it appears that this session was a drop-off.

Tag: Drop-off [The user did not complete the login process, suggesting they may have encountered an issue or decided to leave without logging in.]
