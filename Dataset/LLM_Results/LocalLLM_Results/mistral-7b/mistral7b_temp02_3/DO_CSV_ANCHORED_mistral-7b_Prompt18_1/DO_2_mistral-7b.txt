==================================================

 Tag: Drop-off
   1) The user navigated to the restaurant login page and clicked on the "Restaurant Login" button, but no subsequent actions related to a successful login were recorded.
   2) The user also navigated to the customer login page and clicked on the "Customer Login" button, but again, no subsequent actions related to a successful login were recorded.
   3) The user scrolled through the homepage, indicating some level of engagement, but there is no evidence of any form submission or other actions that would indicate a conversion.
   4) There are no further events in the log file suggesting that the session continued beyond these initial interactions.
   Therefore, it appears that this was a drop-off session as the user did not complete any actions that would typically be associated with a conversion.
