==================================================

 Tag: Drop-off
   1) The user clicked on the "Customer Login" button, indicating an intent to start a session.
   2) However, there is no subsequent log entry showing that the user entered any credentials or completed the login process.
   3) There are multiple log entries of the user interacting with the username and password fields, but these do not constitute a successful login attempt as there is no corresponding log entry indicating a successful login.
   4) The last log entry shows the user clicking on the Lieferspatz logo, which does not correspond to any action that would indicate a conversion.
   5) Therefore, based on the lack of evidence of a successful login or conversion, it appears that this session was a drop-off.
