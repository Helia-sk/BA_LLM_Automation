==================================================

1) Identify the user's actions in the log file.
    - The user navigates to the restaurant login page (/restaurant/login).
    - The user clicks on a link to register as a restaurant partner or log in (click event).
    - The user enters their username (input_change event) with a value of "d".
    - The user does not enter a password.
    - The user does not submit the form (no click event on the sign-in button).

2) Determine if this session was a drop-off or a conversion based on the user's actions.
    - Since the user did not complete the login process by entering a password and submitting the form, this session can be considered a drop-off. The user left the site without logging in.

Tag: Drop-off [The user did not complete the login process]
