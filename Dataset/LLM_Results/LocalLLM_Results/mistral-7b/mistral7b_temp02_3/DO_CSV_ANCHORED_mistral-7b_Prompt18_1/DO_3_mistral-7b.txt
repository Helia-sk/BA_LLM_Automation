==================================================

 Tag: Session is a drop-off

  1) The session was initiated with a click event on the "Customer Login" button (log_1757763695638_oi0yeyisl).

  2) After that, there were multiple input change events for both username and password fields (logs from 1757763697593 to 1757763699845). However, no submit event was recorded. This indicates that the user filled in the required fields but did not submit the form.

  3) The last event in the session is a click event on the password field (log_1757763699845), which suggests that the user might have been trying to correct something, but no further events were recorded after this, indicating that the user left the page without submitting the form.

  4) Since there is no record of a successful login (i.e., a "login_success" event), we can conclude that this session was a drop-off and not a conversion.
