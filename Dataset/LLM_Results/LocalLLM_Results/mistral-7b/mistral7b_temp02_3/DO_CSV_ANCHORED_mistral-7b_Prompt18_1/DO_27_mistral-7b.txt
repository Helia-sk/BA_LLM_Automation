==================================================

1) Analyzing the log file, we can see that the user first clicked on the "Restaurant Partners Register your restaurant or log in to manage orders" link.
   2) Next, the user clicked on the "username" input field. This indicates that the user is attempting to log in.
   3) The user then entered a username ("User1") and the system did not register it as a drop-off because the user continued interacting with the application by clicking on the "username" input field again, which triggered an "input_change" event.
   4) However, there is no subsequent "input_change" event for the password field, suggesting that the user did not enter a password. Since a login requires both a username and a password, this session can be considered a drop-off.
   Tag: Drop-off [The user did not enter a password after entering a username].
