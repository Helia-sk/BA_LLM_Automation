==================================================

 Tag: Session is a Conversion
   1) The user clicked on the "Restaurant Login" link, indicating an intent to log in or register.
   2) After clicking the login link, the user navigated to the login page and entered their username ("dd").
   3) The user then proceeded to click the username input field again, which typically indicates a user is trying to enter a password. This action suggests that the user is attempting to complete the login process.
   4) Since there are no subsequent actions indicating a drop-off (such as leaving the page or closing the browser), it can be inferred that the user successfully logged in or registered, making this a conversion.
