==================================================

 Tag: Session is a Conversion
   1) The user clicked on the "Customer Login" link, indicating an intent to log in.
   2) After clicking the login link, the user navigated to the login page and interacted with the username input field by clicking it.
   3) The user then entered their username (in this case, "User") into the username input field.
   4) Finally, the user entered a password (not shown in the log file) and submitted the form, successfully logging in. Since the user completed the intended action of logging in, this session can be considered a conversion.
