==================================================

 Tag: Session is a Conversion
   1) The user navigated to the "Restaurant Login" page (indicated by the click event on an anchor tag with text "Restaurant Login").
   2) The user then clicked on the input field for username (indicated by the click event on an input element with id "username").
   3) The user entered their username and password, as indicated by multiple input events on the username input field.
   4) No further navigation or interaction was recorded after the username input field interactions, suggesting that the user successfully logged in and continued to interact with the application off-screen (indicated by click and window resize events).
   5) The absence of any events indicating a logout or exit from the application suggests that the user completed their intended action on the site.
   Therefore, based on the sequence of events, it appears that this session was a conversion as the user successfully logged in to the Restaurant's website.
