==================================================

 Tag: Session was a Conversion
   1) The user clicked on the "LieferspatzRestaurant LoginCustomer Login" link, indicating they are intending to log in or sign up.
   2) After clicking the login/signup link, the user did not immediately leave the site, as there are subsequent events logged (clicking on different elements within the page).
   3) The user eventually clicked on the "Lieferspatz" logo, which is typically a common action when navigating through a website, suggesting they were exploring the site further.
   4) Finally, the user clicked on the "Customer Login" link again, possibly to enter their login credentials or continue with the sign-up process. This indicates that the user was actively engaging with the site and did not drop off.
   Therefore, it appears that this session resulted in a conversion as the user continued to interact with the website beyond the initial login/signup click.
