==================================================

 Tag: Drop-off
   1) The user first clicked on the "Restaurant Login" button, indicating an intent to log in as a restaurant user. However, no subsequent actions related to filling out the login form or submitting the form were recorded.
   2) After clicking the "Restaurant Login" button, the user scrolled down the page, but no further interaction with the login form was observed.
   3) The user then clicked on the "Customer Login" button without any prior interaction with the restaurant login form, suggesting that they might have changed their mind about logging in as a restaurant user and decided to log in as a customer instead.
   4) The user did not perform any actions that would indicate a successful conversion, such as submitting a valid username and password or navigating to another page after a successful login.
   5) Since the user did not complete the intended action (logging in as a restaurant user), it is reasonable to conclude that this session was a drop-off.
