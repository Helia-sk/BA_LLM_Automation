 Tag: Session is a Conversion
   1) The user clicked on the "Customer Login" button, indicating an intent to log in.
   2) After clicking the login button, the user was redirected to the login page, as indicated by the click event on the username input field.
   3) The user then proceeded to enter their username, which is a clear indication of interaction with the login form.
   4) Finally, the user entered their password, indicating completion of the login process. Since the user did not show any signs of abandoning the session after entering their credentials, it can be inferred that this was a successful conversion.
