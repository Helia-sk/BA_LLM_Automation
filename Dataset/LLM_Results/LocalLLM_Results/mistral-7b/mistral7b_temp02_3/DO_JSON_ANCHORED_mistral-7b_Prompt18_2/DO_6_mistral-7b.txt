==================================================

 Tag: Drop-off
   1) The user landed on the homepage and scrolled down, indicating initial interest.
   2) The user clicked on the link "Hungry? Order delicious food from local restaurants", suggesting further exploration of the site.
   3) However, the user did not proceed to the login/signup page, which is typically the next step towards a conversion. Instead, the user navigated to the "/customer/login" page, but this seems to be an error as it's not a common user flow and doesn't lead to a conversion.
   4) The user then scrolled back up on the homepage and left the site without any further interaction.
   This sequence of actions indicates that the session was a drop-off, as the user showed initial interest but did not complete the intended action (signing up or logging in).
