==================================================

 Tag: Drop-off
   1) The user first arrived at the homepage and scrolled down to view the content.
   2) After scrolling, the user clicked on the "Hungry? Order delicious food from local restaurants" link, indicating potential interest in the service.
   3) However, instead of being redirected to a page where they could place an order or log in, the user was directed to the login page for the customer portal. This unexpected behavior might have confused the user and caused them to leave the site without taking further action.
   4) The user then navigated back to the homepage and scrolled some more before leaving the site.
   No subsequent actions were recorded, suggesting that the user did not convert into a customer or take any other desired action on the site.
