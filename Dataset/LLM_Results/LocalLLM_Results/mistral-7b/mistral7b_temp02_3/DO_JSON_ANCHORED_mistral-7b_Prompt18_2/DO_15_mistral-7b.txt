==================================================

 Tag: Session is a Conversion
   1) The user clicked on the "Restaurant Partners" link, indicating an intent to register or log in.
   2) The user then clicked on the "Register your restaurant or log in to manage orders" link, which leads to the login/registration page.
   3) After that, the user clicked on the username input field, suggesting they are preparing to enter their login credentials.
   4) Subsequently, the user typed something into the username input field, indicating they are attempting to log in or register.
   5) Finally, the user clicked the submit button (implied by the "debounced_input" event), which would typically trigger a login or registration action.
   Therefore, it appears that the session resulted in a conversion, as the user engaged with the intended action of logging in or registering on the website.
