   2) The user then clicked on the "username" input field, suggesting they are preparing to enter their login credentials.
   3) The user entered their username and password (implied by multiple "input_change" events), indicating a successful login attempt.
   4) There is no subsequent event of the user leaving the site or abandoning their session, implying that the user completed their intended action (logging in).
