==================================================

 Tag: Session is a Conversion
   1) The user navigated to the "/customer/login" page, indicating an intent to log in.
   2) After clicking the "Customer Login" button, the user was redirected to the "/customer/login" page again, suggesting that they successfully logged in.
   3) Subsequent events show the user interacting with other elements on the page, which is consistent with a user who has successfully logged in and is now using the application.
   4) The final event shows the user navigating away from the homepage ("/") after logging in, indicating that they are still actively engaged with the application.
   This sequence of events suggests that the session was not a drop-off but rather a successful conversion where the user logged into the application.
