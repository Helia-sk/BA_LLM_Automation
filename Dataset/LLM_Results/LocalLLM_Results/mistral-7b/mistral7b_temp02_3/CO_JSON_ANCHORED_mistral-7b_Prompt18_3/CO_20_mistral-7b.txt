 Tag: Drop-off
   1) The user clicked on the "Hungry? Order delicious food from local restaurants" link, indicating they may have navigated away from the login page.
   2) The user did not submit any form data for the login, suggesting they did not complete the login process.
   3) The user did not perform any actions that are typically associated with a conversion (e.g., placing an order, making a purchase).

The session appears to be a drop-off because the user navigated away from the login page and did not complete the login or perform any actions indicative of a conversion.
