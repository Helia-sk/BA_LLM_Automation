==================================================

 Tag: Session is a Conversion

   1) The user navigated through multiple pages (Dashboard, History, and View Details), indicating engagement with the application.

   2) The user interacted with various elements on each page, such as buttons and links, demonstrating active interest in the content.

   3) Although there is no explicit action that signifies a conversion (e.g., purchase or form submission), the user's behavior suggests they were exploring and learning about the application, which can be considered a successful interaction.

   In conclusion, while this session does not meet the traditional definition of a conversion, the user's engagement and navigation through multiple pages indicate that it was a valuable interaction for the user, making it a conversion in terms of user experience and engagement.
