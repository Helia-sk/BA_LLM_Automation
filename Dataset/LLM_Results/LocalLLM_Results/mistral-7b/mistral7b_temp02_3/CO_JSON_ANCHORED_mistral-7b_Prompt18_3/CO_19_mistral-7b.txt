==================================================

 Tag: Drop-off
   1) The user navigated to the homepage from the restaurant dashboard settings page, indicating that they were already logged in and possibly looking for a specific feature or section.
   2) The user clicked on the "Customer Login" link, which is typically used for new users or those who are not currently logged in. Since the user was already logged in, this action might have been accidental or due to a misunderstanding of the page's purpose.
   3) After clicking the "Customer Login" link, the user clicked on the username input field, which is usually the first step for entering login credentials. However, since they did not enter any text and did not proceed further, it suggests that they might have realized their mistake and left the page without taking any further action.
   4) The user did not interact with any other elements on the customer login page or perform any actions that would indicate a successful login or conversion.
   5) The session ended with the user navigating away from the customer login page, suggesting that they dropped off rather than converting.
