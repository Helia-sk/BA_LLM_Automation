==================================================

 Tag: Drop-off
   1) The user initially landed on the page "/customer/dashboard/restaurant/4", indicating they were viewing a specific restaurant.
   2) They scrolled down to view more content, but did not interact with any elements, suggesting they were not interested in that particular restaurant.
   3) After scrolling back up, they clicked on the "Restaurants" link, which took them back to the main restaurants page ("/customer/dashboard").
   4) They then scrolled down again, but this time did not interact with any elements before leaving the page, as indicated by the last scroll event.
   This sequence of actions suggests that the user was not engaged enough to make a conversion (such as placing an order or booking a table), and instead left the site after browsing through some restaurants.
