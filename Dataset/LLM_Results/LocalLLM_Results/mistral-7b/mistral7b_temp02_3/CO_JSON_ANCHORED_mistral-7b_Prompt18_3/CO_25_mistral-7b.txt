==================================================

 Tag: Drop-off
   1) The user has interacted with the frontend (click and scroll events), but there is no corresponding backend interaction in the log file. This suggests that the user did not perform any actions that would trigger a server response, such as submitting a form or making a purchase.
   2) The user's session does not show any attempts to navigate away from the page or close the browser, indicating that they were actively engaged with the site. However, the lack of backend interaction suggests that they did not complete their intended action (e.g., viewing the menu).
   3) Since the user did not complete their intended action and there is no indication that they will return to the site based on their current session, it can be inferred that this was a drop-off. The user may have encountered an issue or found what they were looking for elsewhere, leading to them leaving the site without completing their intended action.
