==================================================

 Tag: Drop-off
   1) The log file contains two frontend click events, but there are no corresponding backend HTTP requests related to the "orders.accept_order" endpoint. This indicates that the user did not successfully place an order, which is a common sign of a drop-off.
   2) The first frontend click event is on a button labeled "Accept", but there's no corresponding backend response with a status code of 200 or any other success status, suggesting that the accept_order request was not processed.
   3) The second frontend click event is on an SVG element, which could be part of the user interface but does not seem to have a direct correlation with the order acceptance process. Since there's no subsequent backend response indicating successful order processing, it further supports the idea that this session was a drop-off.
