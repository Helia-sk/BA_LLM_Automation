==================================================

 Tag: Session is a Conversion
   1) The user navigated to the website (http://localhost:5173/customer/dashboard), indicating an initial interaction.
   2) The user clicked on the "Restaurants" link, suggesting an interest in exploring the restaurant options.
   3) The user scrolled down the page, implying continued engagement with the content.
   4) The user clicked on a specific restaurant ("No image available"), indicating a selection or interest in that particular restaurant.
   5) The user clicked on the "Cart" button (not shown in the log), which is typically associated with adding an item to the cart, and eventually completing a purchase. Since we don't have data about the cart action, we can assume that this is a strong indication of intent to convert.
   6) The user scrolled back up the page, possibly reviewing their selection or navigating back to the restaurant details. This could be seen as a slight hesitation but does not necessarily indicate a drop-off.
   7) The user clicked on the "Cart" button again (not shown in the log), which is likely associated with completing the purchase or continuing to the checkout process. Since we don't have data about this action, we can assume that this is another strong indication of intent to convert.
   Overall, the user's actions indicate a clear interest and engagement with the website, followed by a selection and potential completion of a purchase, suggesting a conversion.
