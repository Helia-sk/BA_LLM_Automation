==================================================

 Tag: Session is a Conversion
   1) The user clicked on the "Menu" link, indicating they navigated to the menu page.
   2) The user then clicked on the "Add Item" button, suggesting they added an item to the menu.
   3) No subsequent actions related to leaving the site were recorded in the log file, implying that the user continued interacting with the site after adding the item.
   4) Since no drop-off events (such as closing the browser or navigating away from the site) were observed, it can be inferred that the session was a conversion.
