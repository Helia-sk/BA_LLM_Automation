==================================================

 Tag: Drop-off
   1) The user clicked on the "Customer Login" link, indicating they navigated to the login page.
   2) The user then clicked on the username input field, suggesting they intended to enter their username.
   3) However, there is no subsequent action showing that the user entered a username or password and submitted the form.
   4) The last action in the log file shows the user clicking on an empty area of the login form, which could indicate confusion or abandonment of the session.
   Therefore, based on the available data, it appears this session was a drop-off as the user did not complete the intended action (logging in).
