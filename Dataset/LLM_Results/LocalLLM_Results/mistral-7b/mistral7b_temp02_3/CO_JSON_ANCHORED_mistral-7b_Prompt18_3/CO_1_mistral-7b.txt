==================================================

 Tag: Session was a Conversion
   1) The user clicked on the "Customer Login" link, indicating they are intending to start a login session.
   2) After clicking the "Customer Login" link, the user navigated to the login page and entered their username ("User1"). This shows that the user is actively engaging with the site.
   3) The user then clicked on the username input field again, which typically indicates they are trying to type in their password. Since no password entry was recorded, it's possible that the user has completed the login process and moved on to other actions.
   4) There is no subsequent action suggesting a drop-off or abandonment of the session. The last event shows the user interacting with the site, which indicates they are still actively engaged.
   5) The absence of any events indicating logout or navigation away from the site suggests that the user's session has not ended, further supporting the conclusion that this was a conversion.
