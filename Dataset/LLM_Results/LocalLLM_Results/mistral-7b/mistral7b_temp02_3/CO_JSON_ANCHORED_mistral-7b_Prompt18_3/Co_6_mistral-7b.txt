==================================================

 Tag: Session is a Conversion
   1) The user clicked on the "Customer Login" link, indicating an intent to log in.
   2) The user then interacted with the login form by clicking on the username input field and the password input field, suggesting that they are preparing to enter their credentials.
   3) After entering their credentials, the user clicked on the submit button, which typically submits the form and attempts to log the user in.
   4) Since there is no subsequent log indicating a drop-off or error, it can be assumed that the login was successful and the session continued beyond this log file. Therefore, this session appears to be a conversion.
