 Tag: Drop-off
   1) The user navigated to the website (page_view event).
   2) The user clicked on the "History" link to navigate to the History page (click event).
   3) The user clicked on a button labeled "View Details" on the History page (click event).
   4) The user clicked on a button labeled "Reject" on the details page, indicating they did not make a purchase or take any other desired action (click event).
   5) The user closed the session by clicking the "X" button or navigating away from the website (page_view event does not occur, implying no further interaction with the site).
   Since the user did not complete any conversion actions such as making a purchase or filling out a form, this session can be considered a drop-off.
