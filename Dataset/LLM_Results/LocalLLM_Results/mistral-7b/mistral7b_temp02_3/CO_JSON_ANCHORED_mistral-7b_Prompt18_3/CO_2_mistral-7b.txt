==================================================

 Tag: Session is a Conversion
   1) The user clicked on the "Customer Login" link, indicating an intent to start a session.
   2) After clicking the "Customer Login" link, the user was redirected to the login page.
   3) On the login page, the user clicked on the username input field, suggesting that they are preparing to enter their credentials.
   4) The user then typed something into the username input field, indicating that they are attempting to log in.
   5) After typing into the username input field, the user clicked the "Already have an account? Sign in" button, which typically takes users to a different page if it's a drop-off. However, since no such navigation event was recorded, it can be assumed that the user stayed on the same page and continued with the login process.
   6) The user then clicked on the username input field again, possibly to correct or verify their entry. This action is consistent with a user trying to complete the login process rather than abandoning it.
   Therefore, based on the sequence of events in the log file, it appears that the session was a conversion as the user successfully logged in and continued with their intended action.
