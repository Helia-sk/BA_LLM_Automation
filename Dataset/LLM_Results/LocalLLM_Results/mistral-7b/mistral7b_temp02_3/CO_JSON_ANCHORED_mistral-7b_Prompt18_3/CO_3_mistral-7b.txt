==================================================

 Tag: Session is a Conversion
   1) The user clicked on the "Restaurant Login" link, indicating that they are intending to start a session.
   2) The user then entered their username ("User1") in the username input field and clicked on it twice, suggesting that they were typing their username.
   3) The user also typed something into the password input field, although it is not specified what it was, but the fact that they interacted with it suggests that they are trying to complete the login process.
   4) Finally, the user clicked on the username input field again, which could indicate that they were done typing their username and were ready to move on to the next step (typing their password).
   Overall, the sequence of events indicates that the user is actively engaging with the login process, suggesting that this session was a conversion.
