==================================================

 Tag: Drop-off
   1) The user navigated to the "History" page from the dashboard, indicating an active session.
   2) The user clicked on a history item, suggesting they were interested in viewing details of a specific order.
   3) However, the user did not proceed further by clicking on any other interactive elements such as "View Details" or interacting with the order details page, which indicates that they may have left the site without completing their intended action (e.g., making a purchase or placing an order). This lack of interaction suggests a drop-off in the session.
   4) The user then closed the site by clicking on the "X" button, further confirming that they left the site without taking any additional actions.
