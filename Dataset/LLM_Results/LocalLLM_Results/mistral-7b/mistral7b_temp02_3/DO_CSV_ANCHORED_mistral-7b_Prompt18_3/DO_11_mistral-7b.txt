==================================================

1) Analyzing the log file, we can see that the user navigated to the customer login page and clicked on the "Customer Login" button.

2) Next, the user interacted with the username input field by clicking on it twice (indicating focus), then entered "User", "User1", and finally "User1". This suggests that the user is typing in their username.

3) The user also interacted with the password input field by clicking on it once, but no text was entered, suggesting that the user did not enter a password.

4) Since the user did not complete the login process by entering a password and clicking the submit button, this session can be considered a drop-off. The user navigated to the login page, started the login process, but did not complete it.

Tag: Drop-off [The user did not enter a password].
