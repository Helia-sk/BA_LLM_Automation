==================================================

1) Identify the user interaction events in the log file.
    - The user clicks on the "Customer Login" link (log_1757764322512_gdkx56y2p).
    - The user enters a username ("User1") and does not submit the form yet (log_1757764323386_u7cqrk0al, log_1757764324592_lqjzg8vxh, log_1757764325445_45j99g4jz, and log_1757764325944_45j99g4jz).
    - The user clicks on the username input field (log_1757764325445_45j99g4jz and log_1757764325944_45j99g4jz).
    - The user enters a password but does not submit the form (log_1757764326085_qbxwkf9yh, log_1757764326621_vn8r6lzjg).
    - The user clicks on the password input field (log_1757764326085_qbxwkf9yh and log_1757764326621_vn8r6lzjg).
    - The user clicks on the password input field again (log_1757764326621_vn8r6lzjg).

2) Determine if there is a form submission event.
    - There is no form submission event in the log file, indicating that the user did not complete the login process.

3) Based on the analysis, we can conclude that this session was a drop-off. The user interacted with the login page but did not submit the form to complete the login process.
   Tag: Drop-off [The user did not complete the login process].
