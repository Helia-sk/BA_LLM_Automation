==================================================

 Tag: Drop-off
   1) The user clicked on the "Customer Login" button, indicating an attempt to log in.
   2) However, no subsequent logs show the user entering a password or submitting the login form.
   3) The last logged event was a click event on the username input field, which suggests that the user may have been typing their username but did not complete the action.
   4) There are no logs indicating successful authentication or navigation to another page, which would indicate a conversion.
   Therefore, it appears that this session was a drop-off as the user did not complete the login process.
