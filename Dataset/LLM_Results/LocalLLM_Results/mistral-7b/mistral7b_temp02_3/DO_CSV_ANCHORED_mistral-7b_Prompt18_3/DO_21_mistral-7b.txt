==================================================

1) Analyzing the log file, we can see that the user first navigates to the "/restaurant/login" page (log_1757766444047_g8wc8pd8q).

2) Next, the user clicks on the "Restaurant Login" button (log_1757766445475_g8wc8pd8q), indicating an intent to log in.

3) The user then interacts with the username input field by clicking on it (log_1757766446309_bwg76ugj7). This suggests that the user is preparing to enter their username.

4) The user also interacts with the password input field by clicking on it (log_1757766447943_t2x0kg879), indicating an intent to enter their password as well.

5) However, we do not see any subsequent logs suggesting that the user has entered their credentials and submitted the login form. Instead, there are multiple "input_change" events, which could indicate that the user is typing in their username or password but no submit event follows.

6) The last log entry shows a window resize event (log_1757766444047_g8wc8pd8q), which could suggest that the user might have navigated away from the page without completing the login process.

Tag: Drop-off
[Reason]: The user interacted with the login form but did not submit it, and there is no subsequent activity suggesting a successful login or navigation to another page. This suggests that the user may have dropped off during the login process.
