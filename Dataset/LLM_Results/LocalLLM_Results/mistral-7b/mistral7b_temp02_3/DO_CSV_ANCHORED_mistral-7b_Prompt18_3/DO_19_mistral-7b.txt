==================================================

1) Identify the user action sequence in the log file.
    - The user navigates to the restaurant login page (log_1757766264288_dtgtd2kwl).
    - The user clicks on the "Restaurant Partners" link, which is a call-to-action for registration or login (log_1757766265457_otzii3aum).
    - The user interacts with the username input field by clicking it (log_1757766265457_ho5fyo7ke) and typing "User1" (log_1757766267707_js8xyblyk, log_1757766265457_otzii3aum).
    - The user interacts with the password input field by clicking it (log_1757766268200_zp9jf0r3g, log_1757766267707_js8xyblyk) but does not enter any text.
    - The user clicks the login button (log_1757766268200_zp9jf0r3g).

2) Determine if the session was a drop-off or a conversion.
    - Since the user did not enter any password and clicked the login button, it is likely that they were unable to complete the login process due to missing credentials. This indicates a drop-off.

Tag: Drop-off
Reason: The user did not provide valid login credentials.
