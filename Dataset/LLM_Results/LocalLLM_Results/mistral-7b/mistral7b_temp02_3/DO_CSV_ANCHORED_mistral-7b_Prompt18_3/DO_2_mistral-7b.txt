   1) The user visited the restaurant login page and customer login page, but did not perform any actions that indicate a successful login.
   2) The user scrolled through the pages, but there is no event indicating a form submission or a click on a button that would confirm a successful login.
   3) There is no event of navigating to another page or performing an action that suggests a conversion, such as adding items to a cart or making a purchase.
   4) The user did not interact with any elements on the pages that could be considered a conversion event, such as clicking on a call-to-action button or filling out a form.
   5) The user's session ended without any clear indication of a successful interaction or conversion. This suggests that the session was likely a drop-off.
