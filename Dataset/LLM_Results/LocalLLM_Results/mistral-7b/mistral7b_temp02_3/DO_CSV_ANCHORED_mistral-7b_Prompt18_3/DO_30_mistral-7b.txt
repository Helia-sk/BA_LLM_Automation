==================================================

1) [Step 1] Identify the user's actions in the log file. The user navigates from "/restaurant/dashboard" to "/restaurant/dashboard/menu", indicating they are exploring the menu.

2) [Step 2] The user clicks on an "Add Item" button, which suggests they are taking a step towards adding a new item to the menu or ordering food.

3) [Step 3] After clicking "Add Item", the user navigates back to "/restaurant/dashboard/menu". This could indicate that they might be waiting for something (like the form to load), but there's no clear indication of a conversion yet.

4) [Step 4] The user leaves the page, as indicated by the lack of further actions in the log file.

Tag: Drop-off
[Reason] The user did not complete any action that would be considered a conversion (e.g., placing an order, adding an item to a cart, or submitting a form). Instead, they navigated away from the page without performing such an action.
