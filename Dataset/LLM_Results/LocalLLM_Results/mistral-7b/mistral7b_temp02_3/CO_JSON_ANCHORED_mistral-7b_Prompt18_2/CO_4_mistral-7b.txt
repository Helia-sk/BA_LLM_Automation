==================================================

 Tag: Drop-off
   1) The user clicked on the "Restaurant Login" link, indicating they navigated to the login page.
   2) After landing on the login page, the user did not interact with any of the form fields such as username or password, suggesting they may have been unsure about proceeding with the login process.
   3) The user then clicked on the "Already have an account? Sign in" link, which typically indicates a user who wants to create a new account rather than log in. This further supports the idea that the user was not intending to complete the login process.
   4) The user did not enter any information into the username field or click the submit button, and instead navigated away from the page by clicking on other links, indicating they may have abandoned the session without completing the login.
   Therefore, it appears that this session was a drop-off as the user did not complete the intended action of logging in to the restaurant's website.
