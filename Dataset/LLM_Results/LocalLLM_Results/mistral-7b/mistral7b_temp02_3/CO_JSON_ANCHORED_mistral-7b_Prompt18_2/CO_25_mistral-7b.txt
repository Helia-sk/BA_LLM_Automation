==================================================

 Tag: Drop-off
   1) The user navigated to the restaurant dashboard menu page (indicated by the "click" event on an "A" tag with text "Menu").
   2) The user scrolled down the page, but no form submission or other significant interaction was recorded.
   3) After scrolling, there is no further activity or interaction from the user, indicating that they may have left the page without taking any action (such as placing an order).
   Since there is no evidence of a conversion event (like placing an order or navigating to another page where an order can be placed), it appears that this session was a drop-off.
