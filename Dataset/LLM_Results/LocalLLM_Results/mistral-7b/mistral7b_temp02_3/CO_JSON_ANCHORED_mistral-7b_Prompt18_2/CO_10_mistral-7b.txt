==================================================

 Tag: Drop-off
   1) The user clicked on the "Balance" link, indicating an interest in checking their account balance.
   2) However, after clicking the "Balance" link, no further interactions related to making a purchase or performing any other significant action were recorded.
   3) The last interaction was the user clicking on the "Orders" link, which could indicate curiosity but does not necessarily lead to a conversion as it is not directly related to purchasing or adding items to the cart.
   4) Since no further actions indicating a purchase or any other significant action were recorded after the initial interest in checking the balance, it can be inferred that this session was likely a drop-off.
