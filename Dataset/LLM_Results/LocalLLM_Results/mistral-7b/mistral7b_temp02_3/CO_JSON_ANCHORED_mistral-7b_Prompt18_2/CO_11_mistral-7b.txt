==================================================

 Tag: Session is a Conversion
   1) The user navigated to the "/customer/dashboard" page, indicating they have already registered or logged in.
   2) The user then navigated to the "/customer/dashboard/dashboard" page, which is typically the main dashboard for a customer account.
   3) The user scrolled through the page multiple times, suggesting they were actively engaging with the content on the page.
   4) Finally, the user clicked on an element on the page, specifically the "No Image Available" text, which could indicate they were interacting with the site's functionality or content.
   This sequence of actions suggests that the user was actively using the site and did not drop off, but rather completed a conversion by accessing their account dashboard and interacting with the site's elements.
