   1) The user clicked on the "Customer Login" link, indicating they are intending to start a session.
   2) The user then navigated to the form for customer login, which is a common action in a conversion scenario. However, no further actions related to filling out the form or submitting it were recorded.
   3) After clicking on the form, there are no subsequent interactions that suggest the user has completed the login process or continued with other actions on the site. This lack of engagement indicates that the session did not result in a conversion.
