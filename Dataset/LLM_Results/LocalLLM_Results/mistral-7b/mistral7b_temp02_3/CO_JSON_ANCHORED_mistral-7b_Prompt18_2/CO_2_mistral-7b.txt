==================================================

 Tag: Session is a Conversion
   1) The user clicked on the "Customer Login" link, indicating an intent to log in.
   2) After clicking the "Customer Login" link, the user navigated to the login page.
   3) On the login page, the user clicked the input field for username, suggesting they intended to enter their username.
   4) The user then typed in a username and pressed the input field, indicating they were filling out the form.
   5) After entering the username, the user clicked the password input field, again showing intent to fill out the form.
   6) Although not shown in the log, if the user entered their password and submitted the form, it would indicate a successful login (conversion). Since the log does not show this step, we cannot confirm a conversion with 100% certainty, but based on the user's actions, it is likely that they intended to complete the login process. However, if the user leaves the page without submitting the form or navigates away from the site, it would be considered a drop-off.
