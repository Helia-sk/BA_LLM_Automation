==================================================

 Tag: Session is a Conversion
   1) The user navigated to the login/registration page (`/restaurant/login`) from the dashboard (`/restaurant/dashboard`), indicating that they were already logged in or registered.
   2) The user clicked on the "Restaurant Partners" link, which suggests they are interested in registering their restaurant or managing orders.
   3) The user then entered their username and password, indicating a login attempt.
   4) After a successful login (since no error messages were recorded), the user navigated away from the login page to another page (`/`), which is typically indicative of a successful login and continued usage of the application.
   5) The final action in the log file shows that the user returned to the dashboard (`/restaurant/dashboard`), confirming that they were able to successfully log in and continue using the application, indicating a conversion.
