==================================================

 Tag: Session was a Conversion
   1) The user navigated to the login page (indicated by the "Customer Login" click event).
   2) The user clicked on the username input field, suggesting they intended to enter their credentials.
   3) The user then clicked on the password input field, further indicating intent to log in.
   4) No subsequent events suggest a drop-off or issue with the login process. Instead, the user navigated away from the restaurant dashboard settings page and landed on the homepage (indicated by the "navigation" event). This could be due to the user successfully logging in and being redirected to the homepage.
   5) The user then clicked on the username input field again, possibly entering their credentials or re-focusing the field for some reason.
   Overall, the sequence of events suggests that the user was able to log in successfully and navigate away from the login page, indicating a conversion.
