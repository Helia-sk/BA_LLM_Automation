==================================================

 Tag: Drop-off
   1) The user clicked on the "Customer Login" link, indicating they are attempting to access the customer login page.
   2) After clicking the "Customer Login" link, the user did not interact with any other elements on the page for a significant amount of time (no clicks or input events).
   3) The user eventually clicked on the username input field and then the password input field, but they did not enter any text into either field.
   4) After clicking the username and password fields, there were no further interactions from the user for a significant period of time before the session ended.
   This sequence of events suggests that the user may have been intending to log in, but ultimately decided not to due to lack of interaction or encountering an issue with the login process. As a result, this session can be classified as a drop-off.
