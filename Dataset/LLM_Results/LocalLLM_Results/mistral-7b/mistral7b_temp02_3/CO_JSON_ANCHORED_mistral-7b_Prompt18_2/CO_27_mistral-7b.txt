==================================================

 Tag: Drop-off
   1) The log file contains two frontend events, but no backend event related to the "orders.accept_order" endpoint, which suggests that the order was not accepted or processed on the server side.
   2) The user clicked on the "Accept" button on the restaurant dashboard (indicating an attempt to accept an order), but there is no corresponding backend event for this action.
   3) There are no subsequent events in the log file that would indicate further interaction with the application, such as navigating to another page or performing another action related to the order acceptance process.
   4) The lack of a complete sequence of events from the user's initial interaction (clicking on the "Accept" button) to a successful completion of the order acceptance process (backend event for "orders.accept_order") suggests that this session was a drop-off, as the user did not complete the intended action.
