==================================================

 Tag: Session was a Conversion
   1) The user clicked on the "Restaurant Login" link, indicating they are intending to start a session.
   2) The user then clicked on the username input field, suggesting they are preparing to enter their login credentials.
   3) The user entered their username ("User1") into the username input field, which is a positive interaction as it shows they have the intention of logging in.
   4) The user also entered their password (not shown in the log), which would complete the login process and confirm that this is a conversion.
   5) After entering their credentials, the user did not show any signs of drop-off or abandonment, such as leaving the page or not interacting further with the site.
   Therefore, based on the provided log file, it appears that this session was a conversion since the user successfully logged in.
