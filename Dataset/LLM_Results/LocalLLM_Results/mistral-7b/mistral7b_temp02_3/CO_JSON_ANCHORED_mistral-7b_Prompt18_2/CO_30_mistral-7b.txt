==================================================

 Tag: Drop-off
   1) The user navigated to the website (page_view event).
   2) The user clicked on the "History" link, indicating an interest in viewing the history of the restaurant.
   3) The user then clicked on a specific history item to view its details (View Details event).
   4) However, after viewing the details, the user did not perform any further actions such as making a reservation or placing an order, and instead closed the page (Reject event).
   5) The user also rejected the option to view more details or take any other action before leaving the website.
   Therefore, based on the lack of conversion events, it appears that this session was a drop-off.
