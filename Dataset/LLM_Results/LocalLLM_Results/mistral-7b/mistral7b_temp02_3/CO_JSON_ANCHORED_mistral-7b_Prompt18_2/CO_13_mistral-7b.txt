==================================================

 Tag: Drop-off
   1) The user navigated to the "History" page from the dashboard.
   2) The user clicked on a button labeled "View Details", but no subsequent interaction related to a conversion was recorded.
   3) The user then clicked on another button labeled "X", which could indicate an attempt to close or dismiss something, but no further interactions were recorded after that.
   This sequence of events suggests that the session was a drop-off, as the user navigated to a page but did not complete any actions associated with a conversion.
