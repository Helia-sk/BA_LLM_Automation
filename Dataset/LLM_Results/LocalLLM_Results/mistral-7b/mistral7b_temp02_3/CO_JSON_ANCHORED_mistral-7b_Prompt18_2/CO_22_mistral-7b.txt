==================================================

 Tag: Drop-off
   1) The user first clicked on the "Restaurant PartnersRegister your restaurant or log in to manage orders" link, indicating they were exploring the site.
   2) Next, the user clicked on the "username" input field and entered a username ("User1"). This suggests that the user intended to log in.
   3) The user then clicked on the "password" input field but did not enter any password, which is a common behavior for drop-offs as users often forget their passwords or decide not to proceed.
   4) The user did not submit the login form, instead they clicked on the login button without providing a password, which is another indication of a drop-off.
   5) Finally, the user left the site by clicking elsewhere on the page, further confirming that this was a drop-off session and not a conversion.
