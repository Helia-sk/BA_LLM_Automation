==================================================

 Tag: Session was a Conversion
   1) The user navigated to the "/customer/login" page, indicating an intent to log in.
   2) After clicking the "Customer Login" button, the user was redirected to the "/customer/login" page again, suggesting that they were successfully logged in.
   3) Subsequent events show the user interacting with elements on the page, such as a username input field and an A tag, which is consistent with a user who has completed the login process and is now using the application.
   4) The final event shows the user on the homepage ("/") after navigating away from the settings page for the restaurant dashboard, suggesting that they have successfully logged in and are now using the customer-facing part of the application. This indicates a successful login and a conversion.
