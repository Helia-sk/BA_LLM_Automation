==================================================

 Tag: Session was a Conversion
   1) The user navigated through multiple pages (Dashboard, History, View Details), indicating engagement with the application.
   2) The user performed an action that could be considered a conversion (Viewing Details).
   3) There is no evidence of the user leaving the site or abandoning their session before completing the conversion action.
   4) The user did not exhibit any behavior that would typically indicate a drop-off, such as clicking on the "X" button to close a page without interacting with it.
   5) The user's interaction with the application suggests they found what they were looking for and completed their intended action (Viewing Details), which is a positive sign of conversion.
