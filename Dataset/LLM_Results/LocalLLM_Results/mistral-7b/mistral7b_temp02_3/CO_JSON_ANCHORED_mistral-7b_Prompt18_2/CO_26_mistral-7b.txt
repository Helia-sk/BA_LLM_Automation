==================================================

 Tag: Drop-off
   1) The user navigated to the website and clicked on the "Menu Items" section.
   2) The user clicked on the "Add Item" button, indicating an intent to add a new item.
   3) The user then clicked on a placeholder area within the "Menu Items" section, but no further interaction was recorded that would indicate adding or selecting an item.
   4) No subsequent interactions were recorded that would suggest completing the action (e.g., clicking "Save", "Submit", etc.).
   Therefore, it appears that the user dropped off during the process of adding a new menu item.
