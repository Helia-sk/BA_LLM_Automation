==================================================

 Tag: Drop-off
   1) The user navigated to the website (http://localhost:5173/) and clicked on the "Customer Login" button.
   2) After clicking the login button, the user scrolled down the page to view the customer login form.
   3) However, after scrolling, there is no further interaction or navigation recorded in the log file, indicating that the user did not proceed with the login process or perform any other actions on the website.
   4) Since the user did not complete any action that could be considered a conversion (e.g., submitting a form, making a purchase), and there is no evidence of further interaction after scrolling down the page, it can be inferred that this session was a drop-off.
