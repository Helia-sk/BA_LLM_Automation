==================================================

 Tag: Session is a Conversion
   1) The user clicked on the "Customer Login" button, indicating that they intended to start a login session.
   2) After clicking the "Customer Login" button, the user navigated to the input fields for username and password, suggesting that they were proceeding with the login process.
   3) The user entered their username ("User1") and then clicked on the username input field again, which typically indicates that they have finished entering their username.
   4) The user also entered their password, indicating that they are completing the login process.
   Therefore, based on the sequence of actions in the log file, it appears that the session was a conversion as the user successfully logged in after clicking the "Customer Login" button and filling out the required fields.
