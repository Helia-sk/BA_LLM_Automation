==================================================

 Tag: Drop-off
   1) The user clicked on the "Customer Login" link, indicating an intent to start a session.
   2) After clicking the login link, there is no subsequent interaction with the username or password input fields, suggesting that the user did not proceed with the login process.
   3) Since there are no further interactions that indicate a successful login or any other actions that would lead to a conversion, it can be inferred that this session was a drop-off. The user likely left the site after clicking the "Customer Login" link without completing the login process.
