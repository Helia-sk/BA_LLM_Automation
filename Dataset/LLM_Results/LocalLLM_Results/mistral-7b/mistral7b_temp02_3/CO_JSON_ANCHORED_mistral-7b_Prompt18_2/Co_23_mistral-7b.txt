 Tag: Session is a Conversion
   1) The user clicked on the "Settings" link, indicating they navigated to the settings page.
   2) The user then interacted with various elements on the settings page, such as clicking on an input field and a button labeled "Add".
   3) Finally, the user submitted data by clicking on another button labeled "Add", suggesting that they completed an action or transaction on the page.
   This sequence of events indicates that the session was not a drop-off but rather a conversion, as the user interacted with and completed actions on the settings page.
