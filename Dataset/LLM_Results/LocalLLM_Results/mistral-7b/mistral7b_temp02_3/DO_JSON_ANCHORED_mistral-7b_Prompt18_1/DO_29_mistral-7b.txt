==================================================

 Tag: Session was a Conversion
   1) The user clicked on the "Orders" link, indicating an intent to navigate to the Orders section.
   2) After navigating to the Orders section, the user clicked on the "Menu" link within the Orders page, suggesting continued engagement with the application.
   3) Finally, the user interacted with multiple elements on the Menu page, including a button and an input field, indicating further interaction and potential completion of a task (e.g., placing an order).
   The sequence of actions and the user's navigation through different sections of the application indicate that this session was not a drop-off but rather a conversion, as the user showed intent and engagement throughout the session.
