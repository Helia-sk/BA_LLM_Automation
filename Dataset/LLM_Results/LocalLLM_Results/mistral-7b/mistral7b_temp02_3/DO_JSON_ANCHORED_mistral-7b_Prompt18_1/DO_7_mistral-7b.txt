==================================================

 Tag: Drop-off
   1) The user first clicked on the "Customer Login" link, indicating they navigated to the login page.
   2) After clicking the login button, the user entered their credentials and focused on the username input field. However, no further actions were recorded in the log file related to submitting the form or proceeding with a conversion action.
   3) The last event recorded was a click on the Lieferspatz logo, which is typically found on the homepage. This suggests that the user may have navigated away from the login page without completing the login process.
   Since no conversion actions were taken after the user entered their credentials, it appears this session was a drop-off.
