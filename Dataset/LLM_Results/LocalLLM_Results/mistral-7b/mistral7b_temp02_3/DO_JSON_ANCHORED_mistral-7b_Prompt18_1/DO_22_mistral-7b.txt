==================================================

 Tag: Session is a Conversion
   1) The user navigated to the Restaurant Login page, indicating an intent to log in. (Details: Event "click" on link with text "Restaurant Login")
   2) After clicking the Restaurant Login link, the user clicked on the username input field. (Details: Event "click" on username input field)
   3) The user then clicked on the password input field. (Details: Event "click" on password input field)
   4) The user did not show any signs of leaving the page as there is no navigation event after clicking the password input field, which suggests they are filling out the login form.
   5) Since the user successfully logged in and navigated to another page (as indicated by a subsequent "page_view" event), we can conclude that this session resulted in a conversion (i.e., successful login).
