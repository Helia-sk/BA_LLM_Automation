==================================================

 Tag: Session is a Conversion
   1) The user clicked on the "Restaurant Login" link, indicating an intent to start a session.
   2) The user then interacted with the username input field by clicking on it twice (debounced_input and click events), suggesting that they were preparing to enter their username.
   3) The user also interacted with the password input field in a similar manner, indicating that they were preparing to enter their password as well.
   4) After entering their credentials, the user clicked on the login button, which would typically submit the form and log them into the system if the credentials are valid. Since no subsequent events suggesting a drop-off or error were recorded, it can be inferred that the session was successful and the user was logged in (conversion).
