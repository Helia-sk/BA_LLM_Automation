==================================================

 Tag: Session is a Conversion
   1) The user clicked on the "Settings" link, indicating they navigated to the settings page.
   2) The user interacted with the dropdown menu by clicking on it twice, suggesting they were exploring options within the settings page.
   3) The user then selected an option from the dropdown menu, which is typically a common action when using a settings page.
   4) There are no subsequent clicks or actions that would indicate a drop-off, such as leaving the site or closing the browser.
   5) The fact that the user continued to interact with the page after clicking "Settings" indicates they were engaged and likely completed their intended action on the settings page.
   Therefore, it appears this session was a conversion, as the user navigated to the settings page and performed an action within it.
