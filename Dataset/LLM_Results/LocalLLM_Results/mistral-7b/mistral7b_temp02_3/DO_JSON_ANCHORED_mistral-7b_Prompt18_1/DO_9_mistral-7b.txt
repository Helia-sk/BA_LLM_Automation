==================================================

 Tag: Session was a Conversion
   1) The user clicked on the "Customer Login" link, indicating an intent to start a session.
   2) After clicking the "Customer Login" link, the user navigated to the login page and entered their username ("User1"). This shows continued engagement with the site.
   3) The user then interacted with the username input field by clicking on it, suggesting they were preparing to enter a password or continue with the login process.
   4) Finally, the user clicked on the username input field again, which could indicate submitting the form or continuing with the login process. Since no further actions are recorded in the log file, we can assume that the user successfully logged in and completed the conversion (i.e., a successful login).
