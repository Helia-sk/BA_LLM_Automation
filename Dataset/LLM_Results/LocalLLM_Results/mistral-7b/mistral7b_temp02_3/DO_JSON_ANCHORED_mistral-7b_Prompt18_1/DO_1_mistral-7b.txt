==================================================

1) The first step is to identify the user's actions in the log file.

2) The user navigated to the "Customer Login" page and clicked on the "Customer Login" button, indicating an intent to start a login session.

3) After clicking the "Customer Login", the user interacted with the username input field by clicking it twice (steps 5 and 6), but no text was entered or submitted.

4) The user then clicked on the username input field again (step 9), suggesting that they might have intended to enter their username, but no further action was taken.

5) Since there is no record of the user submitting the login form or performing any other actions that would indicate a successful login, it appears that the session ended without conversion.

Tag: Drop-off [The user did not complete the login process]
