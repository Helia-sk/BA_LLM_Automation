==================================================

 Tag: Drop-off
   1) The user initially landed on the homepage ("/") and scrolled through the content.
   2) The user then clicked on a link to navigate to the "customer/login" page, indicating an attempt to interact with the site.
   3) However, after landing on the "customer/login" page, there is no further interaction or navigation recorded in the log file. This suggests that the user did not proceed with the intended action (logging in or placing an order), and instead left the site without taking any further actions.
   4) The lack of subsequent interactions or navigations indicates a drop-off, as the user did not complete the desired conversion goal (logging in or placing an order).
