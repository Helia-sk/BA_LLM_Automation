==================================================

 Tag: Session is a Conversion
   1) The user navigated to the "Restaurant Login" page (indicated by the click event on an anchor tag with text "Restaurant Login").
   2) The user then clicked on an input field related to the login form (indicated by the click event on an input element with id "username").
   3) After that, the user entered their username in the input field as there is a subsequent input event with non-empty text.
   4) Finally, the user submitted the login form, but this action is not explicitly shown in the log file. However, since the user has interacted with the login form and entered their credentials, it can be assumed that they successfully logged in, indicating a conversion.
