==================================================

 Tag: Drop-off
   1) The user first arrived at the homepage ("/") and scrolled down to view the content.
   2) After scrolling, the user clicked on a link that led them to the login page ("/customer/login").
   3) On the login page, the user entered their username (indicated by the "username" field in the log file). However, no corresponding action was recorded for entering a password or submitting the form.
   4) The user then scrolled on the login page but did not interact with any other elements before leaving the site.
   Since the user did not complete the login process and no subsequent actions were recorded, it appears that this session resulted in a drop-off.
