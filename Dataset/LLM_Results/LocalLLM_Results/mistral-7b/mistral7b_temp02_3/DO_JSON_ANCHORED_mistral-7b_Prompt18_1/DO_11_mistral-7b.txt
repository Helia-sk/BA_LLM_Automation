==================================================

 Tag: Drop-off
   1) The user clicked on the "Customer Login" link, indicating they are attempting to start a session.
   2) After clicking the login link, there is no subsequent interaction or event that indicates a successful login or navigation to another page within the application.
   3) The last event in the log file is a click event on the username input field, but this does not necessarily indicate a login attempt as it could be a user navigating away from the input field without entering any data.
   4) Since there is no evidence of a successful login or further interaction within the application, it can be assumed that the session was a drop-off. The user may have encountered an issue during the login process or decided not to proceed with the login for other reasons.
