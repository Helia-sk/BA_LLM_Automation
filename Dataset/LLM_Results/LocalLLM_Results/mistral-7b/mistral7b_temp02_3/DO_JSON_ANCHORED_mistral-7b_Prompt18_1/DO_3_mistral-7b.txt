==================================================

 Tag: Session is a Conversion
   1) The user clicked on the "Customer Login" button, indicating an intent to log in.
   2) After clicking the login button, the user was redirected to the login page, which suggests that the user intended to proceed with the login process.
   3) The user then interacted with the username input field by clicking and typing something into it, further confirming the intent to log in.
   4) The user also interacted with the password input field, indicating a complete attempt to log in.
   5) After entering their credentials, the user clicked the login button again, which typically submits the form and logs the user in if the credentials are correct. Since there is no log entry suggesting an error or failure, we can assume that the user was successfully logged in.
   6) The last interaction in the log file is a click on the username input field, which could be a minor navigation action after successful login, indicating that the user is still active and engaged with the application.
   Therefore, based on the interactions in the log file, it appears that this session was a conversion as the user successfully logged in and continued to interact with the application.
