   2) After clicking the "Customer Login" link, no further interactions related to filling out the login form or submitting it were recorded in the log file.
   3) Since there is no evidence of a successful login or any other action that would indicate a conversion, the session appears to be a drop-off. The user may have left the page without completing their intended action.
