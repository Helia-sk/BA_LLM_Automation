==================================================

 Tag: Drop-off
   1) The user navigated to the "History" page from the dashboard, indicating an interaction.
   2) The user then clicked on a specific item's "View Details", showing further engagement.
   3) However, the user then closed the details view by clicking the "X" button (indicated by the "Reject" event), suggesting they did not complete the desired action.
   4) Finally, the user navigated away from the site by clicking on the "Reject" link in the dashboard, confirming that they did not convert.
   The session was a drop-off because the user engaged with the site but did not complete the intended action (viewing details and potentially making a purchase or taking another desired action).
