 Tag: Session is a Conversion
   1) The user navigated to the website (/customer/dashboard), indicating an initial interaction.
   2) The user clicked on the "Restaurants" link, suggesting they are interested in exploring the restaurant options.
   3) The user scrolled down the page and interacted with various elements, such as clicking on a restaurant image and scrolling further to view more restaurants.
   4) Finally, the user clicked on a specific restaurant ("No image available"), which is typically an action taken when a user intends to make a reservation or learn more about a restaurant. This indicates a clear intent to convert (make a reservation or engage with the restaurant).
   5) The user then scrolled back up and clicked on the "View Cart" button, suggesting they may have already added items to their cart before viewing restaurants, further indicating a conversion intention.
   Overall, the user's actions demonstrate a clear intent to convert (make a reservation or engage with the restaurant), making this session a conversion.
