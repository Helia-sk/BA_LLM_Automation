==================================================

 Tag: Session is a Conversion
   1) The user clicked on the "Menu" link, indicating they navigated to the menu page.
   2) The user then clicked on the "Add Item" button, suggesting they added an item to the menu.
   3) No further actions were recorded in the log file that would indicate a drop-off or abandonment of the session. Therefore, based on the actions taken within this log file, it appears the session resulted in a conversion (i.e., the user completed their intended action).
