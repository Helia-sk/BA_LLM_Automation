   1) The user navigated to the website (URL: "http://localhost:5173/restaurant/dashboard/menu") and scrolled down the page.
   2) The user clicked on the "Menu" link, indicating an interest in viewing the menu.
   3) However, there is no subsequent interaction or navigation to other pages, suggesting that the user did not complete any further actions on the website, such as placing an order or contacting the restaurant.
   4) As a result, based on the lack of further engagement, it appears that this session was a drop-off.
