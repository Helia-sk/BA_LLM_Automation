==================================================

 Tag: Session was a Conversion
   1) The user navigated to the "/customer/login" page, indicating an intent to log in.
   2) After clicking the "Customer Login" button, the user was redirected to the "/customer/login" page again, suggesting that they were successfully logged in.
   3) Subsequent events show the user interacting with elements on the "/customer/login" page, indicating continued engagement.
   4) The final event is a page view of the root ("/") page, which typically occurs after successful login and navigation to other pages, further supporting the conclusion that this was a conversion.
