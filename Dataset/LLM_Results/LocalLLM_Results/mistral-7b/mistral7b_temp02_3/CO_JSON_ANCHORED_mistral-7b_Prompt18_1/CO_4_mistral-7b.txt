==================================================

 Tag: Drop-off
   1) The user clicked on the "Restaurant Login" link, indicating they navigated to the login page.
   2) After landing on the login page, the user did not interact with any of the input fields or submit buttons related to the login process.
   3) Instead, the user clicked on a link labeled "Already have an account? Sign in", which suggests they might be a new user or forgot their credentials. However, this action does not indicate intent to complete the login process.
   4) The user then clicked on another link, but it is unclear if this was part of the intended flow or a navigation error.
   5) There is no subsequent interaction with any element related to the login process or any other elements that would suggest a conversion.
   Therefore, based on the provided log file, it appears the session was a drop-off as the user did not complete the intended action (logging in).
