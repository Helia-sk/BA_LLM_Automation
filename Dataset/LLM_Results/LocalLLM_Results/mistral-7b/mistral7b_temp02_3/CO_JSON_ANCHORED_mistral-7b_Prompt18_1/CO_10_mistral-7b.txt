==================================================

 Tag: Drop-off
   1) The user clicked on the "Balance" link, indicating an interest in checking their account balance.
   2) However, the user did not proceed to make a purchase or perform any other action that would indicate a conversion.
   3) Instead, the user navigated to the "Orders" section and then clicked on the "View Details" button for one of their orders, but did not complete any further actions in this section either.
   4) The user's final interaction was clicking the "Cart" link, which suggests they might have been considering making a purchase, but there is no evidence in the log file that a purchase was actually completed.
   5) Since the user did not perform any actions indicative of a conversion (such as completing a purchase or filling out a form), it appears this session was a drop-off.
