==================================================

 Tag: Drop-off
   1) The user navigated to the homepage ("/") from a different page ("/restaurant/dashboard/settings"). This indicates that the user was not already on the homepage, but came from another page.
   2) The user clicked on the "Customer Login" link, which suggests they were intending to log in or register as a customer.
   3) However, after clicking the "Customer Login" link, there is no subsequent action indicating that the user successfully logged in or performed any other actions that would indicate a conversion (e.g., placing an order, viewing a menu, etc.). Instead, the next event in the log file shows the user leaving the page by clicking somewhere else on the page ("click").
   4) The lack of subsequent actions after clicking the "Customer Login" link and the subsequent click event suggest that the user did not complete their intended action (logging in or registering) and left the site, indicating a drop-off.
