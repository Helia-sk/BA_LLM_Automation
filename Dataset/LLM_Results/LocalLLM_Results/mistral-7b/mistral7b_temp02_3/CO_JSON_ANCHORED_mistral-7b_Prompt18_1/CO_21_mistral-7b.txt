==================================================

 Tag: Drop-off
   1) The user navigated to the homepage from the dashboard, indicating that they may have been trying to log in or register their restaurant.
   2) The user clicked on the "Restaurant Partners" link, which suggests they were interested in either registering a new restaurant or logging in.
   3) The user then clicked on the "Register your restaurant or log in to manage orders" link, indicating further interest in the platform.
   4) However, the user did not perform any actions that would indicate a successful login or registration, such as entering their credentials or completing a registration form.
   5) The user's session ended with a page view of the homepage, which is typically the first page visited on the site, suggesting they may have been exploring the site but ultimately did not convert.
   Therefore, this session appears to be a drop-off.
