==================================================

 Tag: Drop-off
   1) The user visited the "History" page on the restaurant dashboard.
   2) The user clicked on a button labeled "View Details", but no subsequent interaction related to completing an action was recorded.
   3) No interaction indicating a purchase or submission of any form was observed in the log file.
   Therefore, it appears that this session was a drop-off as the user did not complete any actions leading to a conversion.
