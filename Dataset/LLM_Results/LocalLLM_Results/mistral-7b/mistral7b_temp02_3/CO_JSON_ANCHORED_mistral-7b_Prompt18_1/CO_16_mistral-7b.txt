==================================================

 Tag: Session was a Conversion
   1) The user clicked on the "Customer Login" link, indicating an intent to log in or register.
   2) After clicking the "Customer Login" link, the user navigated to the login page and clicked on the username input field twice, suggesting that they were preparing to enter their username.
   3) The user then entered their username and password, indicating a successful login attempt.
   4) No further actions or events suggest a drop-off, so it can be inferred that the session resulted in a conversion (successful login).
