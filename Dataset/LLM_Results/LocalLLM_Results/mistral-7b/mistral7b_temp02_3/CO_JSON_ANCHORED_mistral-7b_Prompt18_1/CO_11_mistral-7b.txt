==================================================

 Tag: Session is a Conversion
   1) The user navigated to the customer dashboard page, indicating they have an account or are logging in.
   2) The user scrolled through the page multiple times, suggesting they were actively engaging with the content.
   3) The user clicked on a link within the customer dashboard, specifically the "customer/dashboard" link, which is likely a link to a specific section of the dashboard or another related page.
   4) Finally, the user interacted with an element on the "customer/dashboard" page, specifically the "customer/dashboard-link", indicating they were taking some sort of action within the application.
   This sequence of events suggests that the user was actively using the application and completed a desired action (conversion), rather than dropping off without interaction.
