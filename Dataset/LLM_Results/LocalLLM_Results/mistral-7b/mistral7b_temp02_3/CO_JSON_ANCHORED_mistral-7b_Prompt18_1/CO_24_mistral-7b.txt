==================================================

 Tag: Session was a Conversion
   1) The user navigated to the "Menu" page, indicating an interest in the restaurant's offerings.
   2) The user interacted with various elements on the "Menu" page, suggesting exploration and engagement.
   3) The user clicked on the form element associated with adding a new menu item, indicating intent to make changes or add new items.
   4) The user did not show any signs of leaving the page (no navigation to other pages or closing the browser), which is typically indicative of a conversion in this context.
   5) The user's interaction pattern and lack of drop-off actions lead us to conclude that this session was a conversion, as the user appeared to be actively engaging with the restaurant's menu management system.
