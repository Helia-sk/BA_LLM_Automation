   1) The user navigated to the website (http://localhost:5173/) and clicked on the "Customer Login" button.
   2) After clicking the login button, the user scrolled down the page to view the login form.
   3) The user then entered their username (indicated by a username_length of 0 in the log file). However, no corresponding event for entering a password was found, suggesting that the user did not complete the login process.
   4) After attempting to enter their username, the user scrolled back up the page and did not take any further action before leaving the site (indicated by subsequent scroll events).
   No subsequent events indicating a successful login or navigation to another page were found in the log file, suggesting that this session was a drop-off.
