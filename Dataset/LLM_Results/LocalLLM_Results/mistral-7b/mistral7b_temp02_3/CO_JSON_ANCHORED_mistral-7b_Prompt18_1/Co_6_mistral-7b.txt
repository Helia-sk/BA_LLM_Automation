==================================================

 Tag: Drop-off
   1) The user clicked on the "Customer Login" link, indicating they navigated to the login page.
   2) The user then clicked on the username input field, suggesting they intended to enter their username.
   3) However, there is no subsequent action in the log file that indicates the user entered a username or password and submitted the form. This suggests that the user may have left the page without completing the login process.
   4) The absence of any further actions such as clicking on links within the login page or navigating to other pages also supports the idea that this was a drop-off session.
