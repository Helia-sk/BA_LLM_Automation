==================================================

1) Identify the user interaction events in the log file.
   - The user navigates to the login page (`/restaurant/login`) at `log_1757766264288_gkrkmkfy8`.
   - The user clicks on the username input field (`#username`) at `log_1757766265457_ho5fyo7ke`.
   - The user types "User1" into the username input field, which is followed by two events:
     - A debounced input change event at `log_1757766267707_23drcad35` and a blur event at `log_1757766268200_zp9jf0r3g`.
   - The user clicks on the password input field (`#password`) but there is no corresponding log entry, indicating that the user did not type anything into the password field.
   - The user does not submit the form or perform any other actions that would indicate a successful login or conversion.

2) Determine if the session was a drop-off or a conversion.
   - Since the user navigated to the login page, interacted with the username and password fields but did not complete the login process, this session can be classified as a drop-off.

Tag: Drop-off [The user did not complete the login process]
