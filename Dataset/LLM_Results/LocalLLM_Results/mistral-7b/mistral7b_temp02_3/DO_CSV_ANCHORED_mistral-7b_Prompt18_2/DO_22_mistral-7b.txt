   1) The user navigated to the login page for the restaurant, indicating they are attempting to access a specific feature or area of the site.
   2) The user entered their username and password, but did not complete any other actions on the site after that.
   3) The user did not proceed to any other pages on the site, such as the dashboard or menu page, which suggests they may have encountered an issue with the login process or decided not to continue using the site.
   4) The user's session ended without any further interaction, indicating that they likely dropped off from the site rather than converting (i.e., completing a desired action such as placing an order).
