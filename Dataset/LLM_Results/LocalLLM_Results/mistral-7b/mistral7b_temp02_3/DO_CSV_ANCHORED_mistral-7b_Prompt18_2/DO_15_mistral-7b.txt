==================================================

1) Identify the sequence of events in the log file.
    - The user navigates to the login page (log_1757765739057_oh0wam64b, log_1757765734477_fzs50yx6q).
    - The user clicks on the "Sign In" button (log_1757765739155_xvqrmot0w) but does not provide a username or password.
    - The user types "d" in the username input field (log_1757765735118_8yxn0gcnk, log_1757765734477_fzs50yx6q).
    - The user changes the password input field but does not provide any value (log_1757765739057_5aax9n2ew, log_1757765741998_6sw2c0sok).
    - The user clicks the "Sign In" button again (log_1757765742084_sodu7bnx5) but still does not provide a password.

2) Determine if the session was a drop-off or a conversion.
    - Since the user did not complete the login process by providing both a username and a password, this session can be considered a drop-off. The user did not successfully log in, so they did not convert into a logged-in user.

Tag: Drop-off [The user did not provide both a username and a password during the session.]
