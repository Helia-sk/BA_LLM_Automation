==================================================

1) Identify the user action sequence in the log file.
    - The user navigates to the customer login page (log_1757763455454_paomh4a3f).
    - The user clicks on the username input field (log_1757763456645_zkp6yv83t).
    - The user enters a username "User1" (log_1757763459498_p6ozqcr5k and log_1757763459999_rcj9lzlxg).
    - The user clicks on the password input field (log_1757763459999_064iczdh6).
    - The user does not enter a password, but clicks on the username input field again (log_1757763456645_wa8r0ksdg).

2) Determine if the session was a drop-off or a conversion.
    - Since the user did not enter a password and did not perform any action that would indicate a successful login, it appears to be a drop-off session.

Tag: Drop-off [The user did not complete the login process by entering a password].
