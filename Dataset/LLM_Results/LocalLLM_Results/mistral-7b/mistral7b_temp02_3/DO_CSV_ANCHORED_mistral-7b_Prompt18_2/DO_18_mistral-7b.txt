==================================================

1) Identify the user interaction events in the log file.
    - The user navigates to the login page (/restaurant/login).
    - The user clicks on the "Register your restaurant or log in to manage orders" link.
    - The user clicks on the username input field.
    - The user types "User1" into the username input field.
    - The user clicks on the password input field.
    - The user does not provide a password, so no corresponding event is logged.
    - The user clicks on the login button (not found in the log file).

2) Determine if the session was a drop-off or a conversion.
    - Since the user did not provide a password and did not trigger any subsequent events, it appears that the session ended without completing the login process. This indicates a drop-off.

Tag: Drop-off [The user did not complete the login process by providing a password.]
