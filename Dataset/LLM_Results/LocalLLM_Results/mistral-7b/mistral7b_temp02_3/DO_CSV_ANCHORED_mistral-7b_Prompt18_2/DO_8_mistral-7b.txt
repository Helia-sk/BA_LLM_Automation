==================================================

1) Identify the user action sequence in the log file.
    - The user first clicks on the "Customer Login" link (log_1757764216697).
    - Then, the user clicks on the username input field (log_1757764217892) and types in a username ("User1", log_1757764219814 and log_1757764217892).
    - After that, the user clicks on the password input field (log_1757764220385) but does not type anything.
    - Finally, the user clicks on the login button (log_1757764220490), which is not present in the log file, implying that the user did not complete the login process.

2) Determine if the session was a drop-off or a conversion.
    - Since the user did not complete the login process by not entering any password and clicking the submit button, this session can be considered a drop-off.

Tag: Drop-off [The user did not complete the login process by not entering any password and clicking the submit button.]
