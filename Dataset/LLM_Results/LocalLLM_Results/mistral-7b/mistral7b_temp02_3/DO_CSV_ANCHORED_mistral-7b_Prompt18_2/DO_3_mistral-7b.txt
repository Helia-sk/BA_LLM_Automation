==================================================

 Tag: Session is a drop-off

  1) The session ID (session_1757763080934_tj3hw6dyl) remains the same for all logs, indicating that it's the same user interacting with the application.

  2) The route (/customer/login) suggests that the user is attempting to log in to the customer area of the application.

  3) However, there are no logs indicating a successful login event (e.g., login.v1). Instead, we see multiple input_change events for both the username and password fields, but no corresponding click or submit event on the login button.

  4) The absence of a submit or click event on the login button suggests that the user did not complete the login process, indicating a drop-off.

  5) Additionally, there are no subsequent logs after the last input_change event, which further supports the idea that the user dropped off without completing the login process.
