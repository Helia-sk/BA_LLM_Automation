   1) The user navigated to the login page (route: /customer/login), which suggests they are trying to access a secured area of the application.
   2) The user entered their username ("hi") and clicked the "Sign In" button, indicating an attempt to log in. However, no subsequent logs show a successful login event.
   3) The user did not perform any actions that typically indicate a conversion (e.g., adding items to a cart, completing a purchase).
   4) The user's session ended without any further interaction or conversion events, suggesting a drop-off.
