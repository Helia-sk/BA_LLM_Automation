==================================================

 Tag: Drop-off
   1) The log file shows multiple HTTP requests and responses related to the menu API, but there are no subsequent events indicating user interaction or navigation to another page.
   2) The last event in the log file is a click event on the "Menu" link, but there are no subsequent events after that, suggesting the user did not continue interacting with the application.
   3) Since there are no subsequent events indicating further engagement or conversion actions (e.g., adding items to the cart, making a purchase), it appears that this session was a drop-off.
