==================================================

 Tag: Drop-off
   1) The user clicked on the "Customer Login" button, indicating an attempt to start a session.
   2) After clicking the "Customer Login" button, no further interaction with the login form was recorded in the log file.
   3) The absence of subsequent interactions such as entering a username or password suggests that the user did not complete the login process and may have left the page.
   4) Since there is no evidence of a successful login or any other actions that would indicate a conversion, it appears that this session was a drop-off.
