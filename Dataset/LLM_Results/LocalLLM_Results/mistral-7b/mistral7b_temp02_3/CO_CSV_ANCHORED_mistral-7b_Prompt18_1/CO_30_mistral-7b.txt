==================================================

 Tag: Drop-off
   1) The user navigated to the "/restaurant/dashboard" page (log_1758986435792_vg05snfan).
   2) The user clicked on the "History" link (log_1758986443885_ebam3884s), which led to the "/restaurant/dashboard/history" page.
   3) The user clicked on a button labeled "View Details" (log_1758986445667_767la5ed5), but did not perform any further actions that would indicate a conversion, such as making a purchase or filling out a form.
   4) The user then clicked on an "X" button to close the details view (log_1758986449152_c1joj5i8c), and navigated back to the "/restaurant/dashboard" page (not shown in logs).
   5) The user did not perform any further actions before leaving the site, as indicated by the lack of subsequent log entries.

Since the user did not complete a conversion action (such as making a purchase or filling out a form), and navigated away from the site without performing any other significant actions, it appears that this session was a drop-off.
