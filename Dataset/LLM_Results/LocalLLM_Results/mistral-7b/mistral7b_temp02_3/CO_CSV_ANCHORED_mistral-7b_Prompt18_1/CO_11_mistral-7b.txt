==================================================

1) Analyzing the log file, we can see that the user initially landed on the "/customer/dashboard" page (log_1757774276450_fntdti8qo).

2) The user then scrolled down the page multiple times, indicating they were actively exploring the content (log_1757774275386_7sjdieux2, log_1757774274528_gt98ftf43).

3) The user then navigated to a specific restaurant page ("/customer/dashboard/restaurant/2"), suggesting they were interested in a particular restaurant (log_1757774312977_t3pr9ygao).

4) After that, the user scrolled down on the restaurant page and clicked on an element labeled "No image available" (log_1757774310865_hjgf6rtyu), which might indicate they were trying to upload an image for the restaurant.

5) The user then scrolled back up on the restaurant page and left without any further interaction (log_1757774312977_t3pr9ygao, log_175777430865_vbnm7rtyu).

Tag: Drop-off
Reason: The user showed interest in a specific restaurant but did not complete any action that would indicate a conversion (e.g., submitting an image or placing an order). They left the page without further interaction, suggesting they may have encountered an issue or decided not to proceed.
