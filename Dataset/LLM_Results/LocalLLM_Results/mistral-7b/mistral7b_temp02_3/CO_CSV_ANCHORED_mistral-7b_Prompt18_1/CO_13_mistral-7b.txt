==================================================

 Tag: Drop-off
   1) The logs show multiple clicks on the "History" and "View Details" buttons, indicating that the user is navigating through the dashboard. However, there are no logs for any successful order completion or details view.
   2) The last log shows a click event on the "Done" button in the history section, but there is no corresponding log for an order details view or completion. This suggests that the user might have closed the page without completing the desired action (ordering).
   3) Since the user did not complete the desired action of ordering, it can be inferred that this session was a drop-off. The user navigated through the dashboard but did not proceed to place an order.
