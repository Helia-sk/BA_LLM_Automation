==================================================

1) Identify the user action sequence in the log file.
    - The user clicks on the "Customer Login" button (log_1758982438247_pt8yjs0my), indicating they have initiated a login attempt.
    - After clicking the login button, there are multiple events related to input changes in the username field (logs from log_1758982439208_192pz6ra6 to log_1758982441938_wumb6h8t2). This suggests that the user is entering their username.
    - The user also enters data into the password field, but there are no corresponding logs for this action, which means we cannot determine if they have completed the password input.

2) Determine if the session was a drop-off or a conversion based on the available information.
    - Since we do not have enough information to confirm whether the user has entered and submitted their password, we cannot definitively say if this is a drop-off or a conversion. However, since the user has initiated a login attempt by clicking the "Customer Login" button, it can be considered an engaged session.
