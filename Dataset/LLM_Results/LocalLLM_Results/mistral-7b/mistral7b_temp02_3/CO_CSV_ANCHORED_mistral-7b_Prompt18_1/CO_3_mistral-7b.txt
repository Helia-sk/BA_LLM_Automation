1) Identify the user action: The user first clicks on the "Restaurant Login" link, indicating an intent to start a session.

2) Determine if the user entered credentials: After clicking the login link, the user interacts with the username and password fields, suggesting they are entering their credentials.

3) Check for successful authentication: The log file does not show any event indicating a successful authentication or navigation to another page after entering the credentials, which suggests that the session was a drop-off.
