==================================================

 Tag: Drop-off
   1) The user first visited the homepage (/customer/dashboard), clicked on "Restaurants", and scrolled down to view a list of restaurants.
   2) The user then clicked on a specific restaurant page (/customer/dashboard/restaurant/9). However, there is no further interaction or scrolling event recorded after this.
   3) There is no subsequent click event that would indicate the user performing an action such as adding an item to their cart or making a purchase.
   4) The last event in the log file is a scroll event on the restaurant page, but there is no further interaction or navigation event after this.
   5) Since there is no evidence of any subsequent engagement or conversion actions, it can be inferred that the session was likely a drop-off.
