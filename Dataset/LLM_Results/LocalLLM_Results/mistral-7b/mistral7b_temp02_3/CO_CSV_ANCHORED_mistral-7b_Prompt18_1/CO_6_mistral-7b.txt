==================================================

1) The first step is to identify the user interaction events in the log file.
2) We can see that the user clicked on the "Customer Login" button, indicating an intent to start a login session.
3) After clicking the "Customer Login" button, the user navigated to the username input field and entered their username (user1).
4) The user then moved focus to the password input field but did not enter any password before leaving the page.
5) Since the user did not complete the login process by entering a password, we can conclude that this session was a drop-off.

Tag: Drop-off
[Reason]: The user initiated a login session but did not complete it by entering a password before leaving the page.
