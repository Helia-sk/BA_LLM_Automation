==================================================

1) Identify the user interaction events in the log file.
    - The user clicks on the "Menu" link (indicating navigation to the menu page).
    - The user interacts with various input fields, such as entering "Saladmix" and "8" for an item name and quantity respectively.
    - The user clicks the "Add Item" button, which would presumably add the item to a cart or order list.
    - No further interaction events are recorded after the "Add Item" click, suggesting that the user may have left the page without completing any other actions.

2) Determine if the session was a drop-off or a conversion.
    - Since no additional interactions were recorded after the "Add Item" click, it is likely that the user did not complete any further actions on the site, such as checking out or reviewing their cart.
    - Therefore, this session can be classified as a drop-off.

Tag: Drop-off [The user added an item to their cart but did not proceed with checkout or any other actions].
