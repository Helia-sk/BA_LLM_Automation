1) [Step 1] Identify the user interaction events in the log file. The user clicks on the "Customer Login" link, which navigates to the login page.

2) [Step 2] Observe the user interactions after the navigation to the login page. The user interacts with the username and password fields by clicking on them, but no input is provided.

3) [Step 3] Check for any subsequent events that indicate a successful login or further interaction with the application. No such events are observed in the log file.
