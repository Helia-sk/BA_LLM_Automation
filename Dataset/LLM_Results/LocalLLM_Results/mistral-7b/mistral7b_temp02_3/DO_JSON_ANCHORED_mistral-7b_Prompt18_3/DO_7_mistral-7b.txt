==================================================

 Tag: Session is a Conversion
   1) The user clicked on the "Customer Login" button, indicating an intent to log in.
   2) After clicking the "Customer Login" button, the user navigated to the "/customer/login" page, which is expected behavior for a login process.
   3) The user then interacted with the username input field by clicking on it, suggesting they are preparing to enter their credentials.
   4) The user typed something into the username input field, although the log does not show what was entered, it shows that some interaction occurred.
   5) The user clicked on the username input field again, possibly to correct or confirm their entry.
   6) Finally, the user submitted the login form by clicking the submit button, indicating a successful login attempt.
   Since the user successfully logged in and interacted with the username input field multiple times, it is reasonable to conclude that this session was a conversion (successful login).
