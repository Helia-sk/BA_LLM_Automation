==================================================

 Tag: Session was a Conversion
   1) The user navigated to the homepage ("/") and scrolled down.
   2) The user clicked on the link "Hungry? Order delicious food from local restaurants", which indicates intent to interact with the application.
   3) The user landed on the login page ("/customer/login"), suggesting they are trying to access a feature or service of the application.
   4) The user entered their credentials (indicated by the "username_length" field being non-zero in subsequent events), indicating they have an account and are attempting to log in.
   5) The user successfully logged in, as indicated by multiple events with non-zero "username_length".
   This sequence of actions shows that the user interacted with the application, navigated through it, and completed a login action, which is typically considered a conversion for many web applications.
