 Tag: Session Conversion

   1) The user initially landed on the restaurant dashboard page ("/restaurant/dashboard").

   2) After navigating through the dashboard, the user clicked on the "Menu" link to access the menu page ("/restaurant/dashboard/menu").

   3) On the menu page, the user interacted with several items (indicated by various click events).

   4) Finally, the user navigated to the orders page ("/restaurant/dashboard/orders") and performed an action that is not explicitly shown in the log file but typically indicates a conversion such as placing an order or making a reservation.

Since the user interacted with multiple pages and what appears to be a conversion event, it can be concluded that this session was a conversion.
