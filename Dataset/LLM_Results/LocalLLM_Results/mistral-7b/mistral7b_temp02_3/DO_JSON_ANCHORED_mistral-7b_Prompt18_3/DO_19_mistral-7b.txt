==================================================

 Tag: Session is a Conversion
   1) The user clicked on the "Restaurant Partners Register your restaurant or log in to manage orders" link, indicating an intent to interact with the site.
   2) The user then clicked on the "username" input field, suggesting they are preparing to enter their login credentials.
   3) The user entered their username ("User1") and clicked again on the same input field, which is a common behavior when using autocomplete or when the user is confident about their entry.
   4) The user did not show any signs of leaving the site (e.g., closing the browser or navigating away from the page), indicating they are still actively engaged with the platform.
   5) Since the user interacted with both the login and input fields, it is reasonable to assume that they are attempting to log in, which would be a conversion for this session.
