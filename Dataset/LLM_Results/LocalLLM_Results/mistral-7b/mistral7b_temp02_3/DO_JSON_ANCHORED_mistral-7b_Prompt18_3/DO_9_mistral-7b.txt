==================================================

 Tag: Session is a Conversion
   1) The user navigated to the Customer Login page, indicating an intent to log in.
   2) The user clicked on the "Customer Login" button, which is typically the action taken to initiate the login process.
   3) After clicking the "Customer Login", no further actions related to drop-off events (such as navigating away from the page or abandoning the form) were recorded in the log file. Instead, we see subsequent interactions related to the username and password fields, suggesting that the user successfully logged in.
   4) The absence of any drop-off events after the initial login attempt indicates a successful login, thus classifying this session as a conversion.
