==================================================

 Tag: Session was a Conversion
   1) The user clicked on the "Restaurant Login" link, indicating an intent to start a session.
   2) After clicking the login link, the user navigated to the login form and entered their username ("User1"). This shows continued engagement with the site.
   3) The user then interacted with the username input field multiple times, suggesting they were typing in their password.
   4) No subsequent events indicate a drop-off or exit from the session. Instead, the log file ends with no further interactions, but the user's actions up to that point are consistent with completing the login process and converting into an active user.
