==================================================

 Tag: Session is a Conversion
   1) The user clicked on the "Restaurant Login" link, indicating an intent to start a session.
   2) After clicking the login link, the user navigated to the username input field and clicked it, suggesting they are preparing to enter their username.
   3) Subsequent events show the user typing in their username, which is a clear indication of interaction with the page.
   4) The final event shows the user clicking on the username input field again, possibly to continue typing or correct an error. This action, along with the previous steps, indicates that the user was actively engaging with the page and did not drop off.
   Therefore, it can be concluded that this session was a conversion as the user successfully navigated through the login process.
