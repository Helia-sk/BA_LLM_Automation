==================================================

 Tag: Drop-off
   1) The user initially landed on the dashboard ("/restaurant/dashboard") and clicked the "Menu" link to navigate to the menu page ("/restaurant/dashboard/menu").
   2) On the menu page, no interaction with any of the items was observed.
   3) The user then clicked the "Add Item" button on the menu page, but no further interactions were recorded after that.
   4) The session ended without any additional interactions or actions that would indicate a purchase or conversion.
   Therefore, it appears that this session was a drop-off as the user did not complete any actions leading to a conversion.
