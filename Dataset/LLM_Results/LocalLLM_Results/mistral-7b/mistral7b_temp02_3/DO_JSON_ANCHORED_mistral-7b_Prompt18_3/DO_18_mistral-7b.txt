==================================================

 Tag: Drop-off
   1) The user clicked on the "Restaurant PartnersRegister your restaurant or log in to manage orders" link, indicating that they may be interested in registering a new account or logging in, but the session did not result in a successful login.
   2) After clicking the link, no subsequent login-related events were recorded, suggesting that the user did not proceed with the login process.
   3) The user's interaction with the username input field and the lack of password input suggest that they may have navigated away from the login page without completing the login process.
   Overall, the session appears to be a drop-off as the user did not complete the intended action (login).
