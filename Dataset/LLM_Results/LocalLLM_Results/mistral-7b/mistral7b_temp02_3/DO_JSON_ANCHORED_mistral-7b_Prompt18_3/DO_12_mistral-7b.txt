   1) The user clicked on the "LieferspatzRestaurant LoginCustomer Login" link, indicating they are navigating to the login page.
   2) After clicking the login link, no further interactions related to form submission or navigation to a different page were recorded in the log file.
   3) Since there is no evidence of any successful form submission or conversion event, it can be assumed that the session was a drop-off as the user did not complete their intended action (logging in).
