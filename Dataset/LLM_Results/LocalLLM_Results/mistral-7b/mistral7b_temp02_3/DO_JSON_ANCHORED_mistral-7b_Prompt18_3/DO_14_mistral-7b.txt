==================================================

 Tag: Drop-off
   1) The user clicked on the "Restaurant Login" link, indicating they navigated to the login page.
   2) The user then clicked on the username input field, suggesting they intended to enter their credentials.
   3) However, there is no subsequent action in the log file that indicates the user successfully logged in or performed any other action that would indicate a conversion. Instead, the user appears to have left the page after clicking on the username input field.
   4) The lack of further interaction suggests that the session was a drop-off, as the user did not complete the intended action (logging in).
