==================================================

 Tag: Session is a Conversion
   1) The user clicked on the "Customer Login" button, indicating an intent to start a login session.
   2) After clicking the "Customer Login" button, the user interacted with the username input field by clicking it twice and then typing in a username ("User1"). This suggests that the user is attempting to fill out the required information for the login process.
   3) The user also interacted with the password input field, although no specific actions were recorded for it. However, the fact that the user clicked on the username input field twice implies that they likely intended to enter a password as well.
   4) After entering the username and potentially the password, the user did not show any signs of abandoning the session (e.g., navigating away from the page or closing the browser). Instead, they continued interacting with the page by clicking on the username input field again, which could be a sign that they are attempting to correct any errors or continue with the login process.
   5) The last interaction recorded in the log file is the user clicking on the username input field once more, which might indicate that they are still engaged and working towards completing the login process.
   Therefore, based on the sequence of interactions recorded in the log file, it appears that the session was a conversion as the user showed intent to complete the login process by providing their credentials.
