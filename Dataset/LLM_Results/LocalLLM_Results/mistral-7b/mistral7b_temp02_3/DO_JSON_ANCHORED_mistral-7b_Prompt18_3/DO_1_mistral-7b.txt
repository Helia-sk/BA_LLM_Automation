==================================================

1) Identify the user action that indicates a successful completion of the intended goal (conversion). In this case, the conversion event is the click on the "Customer Login" button.

2) Check if there are any subsequent actions after the conversion event. In this log file, there are no further actions recorded after the "Customer Login" click.

3) Determine if the session ended immediately after the conversion event. Yes, in this case, the session ended immediately after the user clicked on the "Customer Login" button, as there are no subsequent actions recorded.

4) Based on the above analysis:

   Tag: Session was a drop-off
   Reason: The user performed the intended action (clicked on the "Customer Login" button), but there were no further interactions or events recorded in the session, indicating that the user did not continue to engage with the application after the conversion event.
