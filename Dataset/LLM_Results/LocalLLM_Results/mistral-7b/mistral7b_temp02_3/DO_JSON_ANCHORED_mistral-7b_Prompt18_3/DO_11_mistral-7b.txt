==================================================

 Tag: Session was a Conversion
   1) The user clicked on the "Customer Login" link, indicating an intent to log in.
   2) After clicking the login link, the user navigated to the login page and interacted with the username input field by clicking it.
   3) The user then entered their username (in this case, "User") into the username input field.
   4) Finally, the user completed the login process by entering a password and submitting the form, which is not shown in the log file but can be inferred as a successful login since no drop-off events were recorded after this interaction.
   The sequence of actions suggests that the user was able to complete the intended action (logging in) without dropping off, indicating a conversion.
