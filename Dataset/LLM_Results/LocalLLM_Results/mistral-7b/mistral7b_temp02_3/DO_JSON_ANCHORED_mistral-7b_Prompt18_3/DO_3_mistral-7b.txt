   2) After clicking the login button, the user was redirected to the login page, which suggests that they are actively engaging with the site.
   3) Subsequent events show the user interacting with the username and password fields, suggesting they are attempting to log in.
   4) The last event shows the user submitting their credentials, indicating a successful login attempt.
   5) Since the user has successfully logged in, it can be assumed that they have completed the intended action (logging in), making this a conversion session.
