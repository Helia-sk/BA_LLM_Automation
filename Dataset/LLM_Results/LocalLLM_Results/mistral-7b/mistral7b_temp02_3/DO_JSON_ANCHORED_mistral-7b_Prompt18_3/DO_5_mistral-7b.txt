 Tag: Drop-off
   1) The user initially landed on the homepage ("/") and scrolled down to view the content.
   2) After scrolling, the user clicked on a link that led them to the login page ("/customer/login").
   3) On the login page, the user did not interact with any of the elements (no input or button clicks).
   4) The user then scrolled down the login page and left the site without performing any actions.
   Reason: The session was a drop-off because the user did not complete any actions that would indicate a conversion, such as logging in or placing an order.
