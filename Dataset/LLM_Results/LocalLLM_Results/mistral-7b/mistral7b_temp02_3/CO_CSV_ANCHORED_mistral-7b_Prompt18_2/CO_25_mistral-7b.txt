==================================================

 Tag: Drop-off
   1) The log file shows multiple HTTP requests and responses related to the menu API, but there are no subsequent events indicating user interaction or navigation to other pages.
   2) The last event in the log file is a click event on the "Menu" link, which does not lead to any further activity.
   3) Since there are no subsequent events after this click event and the user did not navigate to another page or perform any other action, it can be inferred that the session ended without conversion (i.e., drop-off).
