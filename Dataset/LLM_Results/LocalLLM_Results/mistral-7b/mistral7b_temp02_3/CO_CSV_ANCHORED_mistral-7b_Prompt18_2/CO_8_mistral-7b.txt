==================================================

1) Identify the user interaction events in the log file.
    - The user clicks on the "Customer Login" link, indicating they are starting a session.
    - The user then interacts with the username and password fields by clicking on them, but no input is provided.
    - After that, the user clicks on the username field again without providing any input.
    - No further interaction events are recorded in the log file after this point.

2) Determine if the session was a drop-off or a conversion based on the observed user behavior.
    - Since the user started the session by clicking on the "Customer Login" link, but no subsequent input was provided in the username and password fields, it is reasonable to conclude that this session represents a drop-off. The user did not complete the login process, so they did not convert into a customer.

Tag: Drop-off [The user started a session by clicking on the "Customer Login" link but did not provide any input in the username and password fields, indicating they did not complete the login process.]
