==================================================

 Tag: Drop-off
   1) The user navigated to the restaurant dashboard page (log_1758986435792_vg05snfan).
   2) The user clicked on the "History" link in the dashboard page (log_1758986443885_ebam3884s).
   3) The user clicked on the "View Details" button in the history page (log_1758986445667_767la5ed5).
   4) The user clicked on the "X" button in the details view page (log_1758986449152_c1joj5i8c).
   5) The user did not perform any action that could be considered a conversion, such as placing an order or making a reservation.
   Therefore, it appears the session was a drop-off because the user navigated to multiple pages but did not complete a conversion action.
