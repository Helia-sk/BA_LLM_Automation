==================================================

1) Analyzing the log file, we can see that the user has clicked on the link to access the login page for Restaurant Partners.

2) The user then proceeded to click on the username input field and entered "User1".

3) Next, the user clicked on the password input field but did not enter any password.

4) The user then submitted the form by clicking the password input field again, which triggered a form submission event (form submit). However, since no password was provided, the form submission failed.

5) After the failed form submission, there is no further interaction recorded in the log file, indicating that the user did not attempt to correct the issue and left the page.

Tag: Drop-off
[Reason]: The user did not provide a valid password after entering a username, which resulted in a failed form submission and no further interaction was recorded, suggesting that the user likely left the page without completing the login process.
