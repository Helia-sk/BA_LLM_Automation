==================================================

 Tag: Drop-off
   1) The log file shows multiple HTTP requests and responses related to the "/api/orders/" endpoint, but no successful completion of an order.
   2) There is no log indicating a successful submission or completion of an order, which would typically be followed by a "conversion" event such as a confirmation page or receipt.
   3) The user interactions on the frontend (clicks and navigation) do not seem to lead to a final action that would indicate a completed order.
   4) The absence of a successful order completion event in the log file suggests that the session was a drop-off, as the user did not complete their intended action (placing an order).
