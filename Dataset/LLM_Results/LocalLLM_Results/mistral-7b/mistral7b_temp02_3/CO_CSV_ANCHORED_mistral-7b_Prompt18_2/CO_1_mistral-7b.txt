==================================================

1) Identify the user interaction events in the log file.
    - The user navigates to the customer login page (click on "Customer Login").
    - The user clicks on the username input field.
    - The user types "User1" into the username input field and moves focus away from it (input change event).
    - The user clicks on the password input field.
    - No further interaction with the password input field is recorded in the log file.

2) Determine if the session was a drop-off or a conversion based on the recorded events.
    - Since no password input was recorded, it's likely that the user did not complete the login process and left the page (drop-off).

Tag: Drop-off [The user did not provide a password after typing in their username]
