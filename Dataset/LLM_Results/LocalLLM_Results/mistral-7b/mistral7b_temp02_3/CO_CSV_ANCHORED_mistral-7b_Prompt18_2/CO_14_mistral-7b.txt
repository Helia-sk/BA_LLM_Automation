==================================================

1) [Step 1] Identify the user actions in the log file. The user first clicks on the "Customer Login" link, then enters a username ("User1") and finally leaves the field for the password without entering anything.

2) [Step 2] Determine if any conversion event (e.g., form submission) occurred. In this case, no form submission was recorded, as the user did not enter any data in the password field.

3) [Step 3] Based on the absence of a conversion event and the fact that the user left the page without completing the login process, it can be concluded that this session was a drop-off.

Tag: Drop-off [The user did not complete the login process by entering a password.]
