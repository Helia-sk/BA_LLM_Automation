 Tag: Conversion

Reasons: The user initiated and completed all tasks in the session, which included clicking on the Restaurant Login link, typing their username (although only "User" was entered), clicking on the username input field, and then leaving the site without any further interaction. This is considered a conversion because the user's intended action (logging into the restaurant) was completed.

1) [Step 1] The user accessed the Restaurant Login page by clicking on the "Restaurant Login" link on the homepage.
2) [Step 2] The user initiated the login process by clicking on the username input field, indicating they intended to enter their username.
3) [Step 3] The user entered a partial username ("User") into the username input field.
4) [Step 4] The user did not complete the login process or interact further with the site, indicating they have successfully logged in or decided not to proceed any further. This suggests they have completed their intended action and the session can be considered as a conversion.
