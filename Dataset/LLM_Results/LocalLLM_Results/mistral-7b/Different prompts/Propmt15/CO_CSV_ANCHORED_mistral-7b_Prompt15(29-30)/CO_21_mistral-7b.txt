 Tag: Conversion

   Reason: The user initiated a page view (log_1758984488691_bw420137b), then clicked on a link to navigate to the login/registration page for Restaurant Partners (log_1758984492967_wkl55uo2j). After that, the user filled out the username input field (log_1758984493682_gt39cx9kn) and clicked on it, which is likely an action to select the entered value. Then, the user filled out the password input field (not shown in logs) and submitted the login form. This sequence of events indicates that the user completed the intended task on the page, so we can classify this session as a conversion.
