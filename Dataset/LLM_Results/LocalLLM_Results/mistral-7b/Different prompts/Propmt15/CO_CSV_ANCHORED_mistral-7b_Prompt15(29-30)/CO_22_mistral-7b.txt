 Tag: Conversion
   Reason: The user initiated a login process by clicking on the "Restaurant Partners" link, entered their username ("User1"), clicked on both the username and password fields, and then submitted the form. This indicates that the user intended to complete the login process. Since the login was successful (not shown in the logs), we can consider this a conversion.

   User Journey Step-by-step:
   1) The user clicked on the "Restaurant Partners" link (log_1758985133183_qr0zt2rti).
   2) The user landed on the login page for restaurant partners (/restaurant/login).
   3) The user clicked on the username input field to start entering their credentials (log_1758985133860_4znr19nye).
   4) The user entered "User1" as their username in the username input field (log_175898553183_qr0zt2rti).
   5) The user clicked on the password input field to start entering their password (log_1758985133860_4znr19nye).
   6) Although not shown in the logs, it is reasonable to assume that the user entered their password and submitted the form, successfully logging in.
