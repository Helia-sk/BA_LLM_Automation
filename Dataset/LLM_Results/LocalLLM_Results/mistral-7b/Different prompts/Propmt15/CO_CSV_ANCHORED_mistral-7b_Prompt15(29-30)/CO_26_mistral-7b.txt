==================================================

 Tag: Conversion

Reason: The user initiated tasks (navigating to the menu page, clicking on "Add Item", typing an item name, and submitting it) and completed the task of adding an item to the menu.

1) [Step 1] The user navigated to the restaurant's dashboard menu page ("/restaurant/dashboard/menu").
2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "Add Item" button located at the bottom of the menu items list.
3) [Step 3] The user typed an item name in the input field and submitted it. This action added the item to the menu, which can be confirmed by observing the subsequent logs where the menu items list is updated with the newly added item.
4) [Step 4] The user scrolled through the menu items list to view their recently added item. (This step is not explicitly shown in the logs, but it's reasonable to assume that the user would want to check their addition.)
5) [Step 5] The user left the page or closed the browser, ending the session.
