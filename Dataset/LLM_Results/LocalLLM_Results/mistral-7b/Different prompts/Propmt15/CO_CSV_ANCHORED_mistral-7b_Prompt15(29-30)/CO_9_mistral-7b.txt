==================================================

 Tag: Conversion
   Reason: All initiated tasks are completed (clicking on the "Restaurants" link, scrolling down to view the restaurant pages, and clicking on a specific restaurant).
   1) The user first lands on the "/customer/dashboard" page.
   2) The user clicks on the "Restaurants" link located at position (174, 123).
   3) After clicking on the "Restaurants" link, the user scrolls down to view different restaurant pages.
   4) The user scrolls through multiple restaurant pages, as indicated by several "scroll.v1" events.
   5) Eventually, the user clicks on a specific restaurant page located at "/customer/dashboard/restaurant/4".
   6) On this specific restaurant page, the user does not interact with any other elements, but we can assume that they have found the information they were looking for and left the page. Since all initiated tasks (clicking on the "Restaurants" link and scrolling down to view the restaurant pages) are completed, we classify this as a conversion.
