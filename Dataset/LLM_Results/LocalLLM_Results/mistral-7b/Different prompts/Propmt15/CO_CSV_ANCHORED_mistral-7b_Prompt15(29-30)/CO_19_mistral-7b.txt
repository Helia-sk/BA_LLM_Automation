 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user initiated a page view (log_1758982735683_nn4i1w1qb), clicked on the "Customer Login" button (log_1758982745841_zt9tbfo0t) to navigate to the customer login page, but did not perform any further actions such as entering a username or password. The user then clicked on the username input field and the password input field without typing anything (logs from 1758982746939_7qttgtuwg and 1758982745841_zt9tbfo0t respectively). This indicates that the user did not complete the login process, implying a drop-off.
