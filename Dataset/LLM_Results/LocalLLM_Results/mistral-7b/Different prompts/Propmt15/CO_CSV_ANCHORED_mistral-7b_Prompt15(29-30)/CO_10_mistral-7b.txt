 Tag: Conversion
   Reason: The user has initiated and completed multiple tasks, indicating an active engagement with the platform.

   User Journey Step-by-step:
   1) Initiated a click on the "Orders" link (log_1757774552191_pe3hhyxl6), suggesting the user is interested in viewing their orders.
   2) Navigated to the "Orders" page and clicked on an order for details (log_1757774553728_fcdp6kaj7). This indicates the user wants to inspect a specific order.
   3) Clicked on the "View Details" button within that order (log_1757774552191_pe3hhyxl6), showing continued engagement with the platform and an interest in learning more about their order.
   4) Scrolled down to view order details, including status, total amount, notes, customer details, and order items (log_1757774553728_pl5gfcq86). This suggests the user is reviewing and possibly processing the information about their order.
   5) Initiated a click on the "Back to Orders" button (implied but not explicitly logged), indicating the user might have finished reviewing this particular order and wants to move back to view other orders.
   6) Clicked on the "Balance" link (log_1757774548389_y8ni9pig8), suggesting the user has an interest in checking their account balance or performing a financial transaction.

   The user's journey indicates active engagement with multiple platform features, and as such, this session can be considered a conversion.
