==================================================

 Tag: Conversion
   Reason: The user initiated the task (clicking on "Customer Login") and subsequently performed actions related to the login process, such as entering their username ("username" field interactions). Although there are multiple interactions with the username field, these can be considered as a single task since they are part of the login process. Finally, the user entered their password and proceeded to click the "Login" button (not logged in this log file), indicating that they completed the intended action.

1) [Step 1] The user navigates to the customer login page by clicking on the "Customer Login" link.
2) [Step 2] The user hovers over the username input field and clicks it, indicating they are about to enter their username.
3) [Step 3] The user enters their username into the input field (not shown in logs, but can be assumed based on the "debounced_input" event).
4) [Step 4] The user interacts with the username input field again (implying they may have made a correction or adjusted their entry), which is the first password-related log. However, this should still be considered part of the login process since the user did not enter a password at this point.
5) [Step 5] The user interacts with the username input field again (the second password-related log). This indicates that the user might have made another adjustment to their username or was waiting for autocomplete suggestions.
6) [Step 6] The user enters their password into the input field and clicks the "Login" button, but this event is not logged in this file. However, it can be inferred that the user successfully logged in since they did not drop off at any other point during the login process.
7) [Step 7] (Not shown in logs) The user proceeds with their intended action on the customer portal or dashboard.
