==================================================

 Tag: Conversion
   Reason: The user initiated an HTTP request for the menu, scrolled through the content, and clicked on the Menu button, indicating interaction with the page, and finally left the site. This sequence of events suggests that the user completed at least one task (viewing the menu) and may have intended to take additional actions, but due to the limited context provided in the logs, it is not possible to confirm if all tasks were completed or abandoned.

   User Journey:
   1) [Step 1] Initiated an HTTP request for the menu page (/api/menu/) at timestamp 2025-09-27T17:03:48.
   2) [Step 2] Clicked on the scroll bar to scroll down the content of the menu page.
   3) [Step 3] Scrolled down the menu and observed the content (scroll event).
   4) [Step 4] Clicked on the "Menu" button at position (x:571, y:125) on the menu page, indicating interaction with the page.
   5) [Step 5] Left the site without taking any further actions, indicated by a subsequent log entry showing the session ID and user agent remained constant but no additional interactions were recorded. This could indicate that the user may have completed their intended action (viewing the menu) or chose to leave the page without completing other potential tasks, such as making a selection from the menu.
