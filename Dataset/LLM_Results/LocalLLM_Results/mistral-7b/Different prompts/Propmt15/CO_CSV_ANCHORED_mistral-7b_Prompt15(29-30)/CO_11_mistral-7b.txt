 Tag: Conversion

 1) The user initiated a session by visiting the homepage of the application (`/customer/dashboard`) at `2025-09-13T14:37:56.450Z`.
 2) The user scrolled down the page, reaching the "No image available" span (`/customer/dashboard/restaurant/2`) at `2025-09-13T14:37:55.386Z`, but did not interact with it, indicating potential interest in the content but no immediate action taken.
 3) The user continued scrolling further down the page and eventually reached the restaurant details page (`/customer/dashboard/restaurant/2`) at `2025-09-13T14:38:32.977Z`.
 4) On the restaurant details page, the user clicked on an image (indicated by the "click" event), but no further interaction or scrolling events were recorded after that, suggesting potential engagement with the content or taking action (such as bookmarking or making a reservation).
 5) Although no explicit conversion event was captured in this log file, the user's sequence of actions on the restaurant details page and their continued engagement with the content indicate a potential intention to complete an action, such as booking a table or saving the restaurant for future reference. This is supported by the fact that they scrolled through multiple sections of the homepage before reaching the restaurant details page, suggesting initial interest in exploring the application's offerings.

In this scenario, while we cannot definitively confirm a conversion event, the user's sequence of actions and continued engagement with the content suggest potential interest and intention to complete an action within the application. Therefore, this session can be considered as a possible conversion rather than a drop-off.
