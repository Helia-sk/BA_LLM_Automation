 Tag: Conversion

Reason: The session started with a page view (log 9), followed by clicking the "Restaurant Login" link (log 10). After that, the user clicked on the username input field (log 14), and finally, the password input field (log 15) which are considered as initiated tasks for logging in. Since the session ended with a click event on the login button, it indicates that the user has likely completed the login process.

User Journey Step-by-step:
1) Page View (Log 9): User navigated to the homepage from another page (Restaurant Dashboard Menu).
2) Click Event (Log 10): User clicked on the "Restaurant Login" link, indicating an intention to log in.
3) Click Event (Log 14): User clicked on the username input field.
4) Click Event (Log 15): User clicked on the password input field. These two clicks are typically associated with entering credentials for login.
5) The session ended without any further events, suggesting that the user has likely successfully logged in and continued their journey on the platform.
