 Tag: Conversion

Reason: The user initiated a task (clicking on the "Hungry? Order delicious food from local restaurants" link), which was followed by additional interactions indicating an intent to complete the task (typing in the username and password fields). Although there were some scroll and click events, they do not necessarily indicate a drop-off as they can be normal user behavior while navigating the page. The final event of typing in the username field suggests that the user was actively engaged and intending to complete the login process.
