==================================================

 Tag: Conversion

Reasons: All initiated tasks were completed. The user journey started with a click on the "Restaurant Login" link, followed by navigating to the "/restaurant/login" route. After that, the user interacted with the username input field by clicking on it and then entered their username by typing. The user also clicked on the password input field but didn't type anything, which suggests they might have already had their password filled or used auto-fill. Finally, the user clicked the submit button, indicating a possible login attempt. Since no further logs indicate any drop-off events after this point, we can conclude that the session was a conversion.
