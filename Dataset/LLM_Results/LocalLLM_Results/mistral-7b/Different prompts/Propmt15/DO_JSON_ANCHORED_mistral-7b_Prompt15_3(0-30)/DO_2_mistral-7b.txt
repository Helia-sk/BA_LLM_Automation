==================================================

 Tag: Conversion

   Reason: The user initiated two tasks (clicking on "Restaurant Login" and "Customer Login"), both of which were completed without any apparent issue or drop-off. This indicates that the user was actively engaging with the application, suggesting a conversion.

   1) [Step 1] - User navigated to the homepage at `http://localhost:5173/`.
   2) [Step 2] - User scrolled down the page (scroll event).
   3) [Step 3] - User clicked on the "Restaurant Login" link located at x=488, y=39.
   4) [Step 4] - After clicking "Restaurant Login", the user did not take any action for a while (no scroll or click events), suggesting they were probably filling out the login form. However, this is not explicitly recorded in the logs.
   5) [Step 5] - User clicked on the "Customer Login" link located at x=596, y=29. This indicates that the user may have navigated away from the restaurant login page to the customer login page.
   6) [Step 6] - User scrolled down on the customer login page (scroll event). Again, it's not explicitly recorded in the logs, but we can infer that the user likely filled out the customer login form and submitted it.
   7) [Step 7] - User did not take any action for a while (no scroll or click events), suggesting they were probably interacting with the application on the customer dashboard after successful login. However, this is not explicitly recorded in the logs.
