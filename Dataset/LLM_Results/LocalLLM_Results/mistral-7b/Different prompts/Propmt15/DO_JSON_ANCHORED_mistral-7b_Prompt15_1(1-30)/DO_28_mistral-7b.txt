 Tag: Conversion

Reason: The user initiated a task (clicking on the "History" link) and completed another task (navigating to the "/restaurant/dashboard/history" page). However, they also initiated the task of navigating to the "Settings" page ("clicking on the "Settings" link") and did not abandon that task as we can see a subsequent log entry where they clicked on the "Settings" link and were redirected to "/restaurant/dashboard/settings".

User Journey:
1) [Step 1] The user arrived at the home page ("http://localhost:5173/").
2) [Step 2] The user initiated a task by clicking on the "History" link.
3) [Step 3] The user completed the task of navigating to the "/restaurant/dashboard/history" page.

6) [Step 6] (Implied, not explicitly logged) The user performed actions within the "Settings" page, indicating they were interacting with the page content.
7) [Step 7] (Not observed in the logs) The user might have chosen to leave the site or continue browsing other pages without any explicit action being logged for these activities.
