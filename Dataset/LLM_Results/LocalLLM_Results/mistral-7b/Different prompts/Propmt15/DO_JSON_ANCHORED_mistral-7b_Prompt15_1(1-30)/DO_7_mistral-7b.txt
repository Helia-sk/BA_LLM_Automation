 Tag: Conversion

Reason: The user initiated a task (clicking on "Lieferspatz") and subsequently completed another task (clicking on "Customer Login" and then interacting with the username input field, which indicates they are trying to log in). Although there is an intervening idle period, the final click event suggests that the user returned to engage with the site, indicating a conversion.

2) [Step 2] The user navigated to the customer login page by clicking on the "Customer Login" button.
3) [Step 3] The user interacted with the username input field, suggesting they were attempting to log in.
4) [Step 4] After an idle period, the user returned and clicked on the username input field again, indicating that they are likely entering their login credentials. This constitutes a successful conversion.
