 Tag: Conversion

Reason: The user initiated the session by clicking on the "Restaurant Login" link (log #8). After that, they interacted with the username input field twice (logs #5 and #6), indicating that they entered their username but did not submit it. However, the log shows that the user then clicked on the username input field again (log #7), which could suggest that they were correcting or updating their username before submitting it. Finally, the user interacted with the password input field twice (logs #2 and #3), confirming that they entered their password, and then submitted the form by clicking the Submit button (log #1). Since all initiated tasks were completed, this session can be classified as a conversion.

User Journey Step-by-step:

1) The user clicked on the "Restaurant Login" link (Log #8), initiating the login process.
2) The user navigated to the username input field and entered their username (Log #5).
3) The user did not submit the form, instead they interacted with the username input field again (Log #7), which may suggest they were correcting or updating their username.
4) The user then focused on the password input field and entered their password (Log #2).
5) The user confirmed their entry by clicking on the password input field again (Log #3).
6) The user submitted the form by clicking the Submit button, successfully logging into the system (Log #1).
