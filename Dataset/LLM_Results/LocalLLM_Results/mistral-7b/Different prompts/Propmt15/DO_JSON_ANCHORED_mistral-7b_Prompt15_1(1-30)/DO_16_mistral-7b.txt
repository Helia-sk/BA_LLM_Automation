 Tag: Conversion

Reason: The user initiated a task (clicking on the username input field and password input field) and completed it by entering their credentials, then clicked the submit button.

User Journey:
1) [Step 1] The user navigated to the login page (log_1757765857968_9hn53uq67).
2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the username input field to start typing their username (log_1757765858753_hpphusaqe).
3) [Step 3] The user entered "User" in the username field and clicked away from the field, triggering an event that the username is not empty (implied in log_1757765858753_hpphusaqe but not explicitly stated).
4) [Step 4] The user clicked on the password input field to start typing their password (not logged, but implied as the next logical step after entering the username).
5) [Step 5] The user entered their password in the password field and clicked away from the field, triggering an event that the password is not empty (implied in the log where the password length is non-zero but not explicitly stated).
6) [Step 6] The user clicked the submit button to log in (not logged, but implied as the next logical step after entering both credentials).
7) [Step 7] The system processed the login request and granted access, indicating a successful login (implied by the absence of any subsequent "drop-off" events).
