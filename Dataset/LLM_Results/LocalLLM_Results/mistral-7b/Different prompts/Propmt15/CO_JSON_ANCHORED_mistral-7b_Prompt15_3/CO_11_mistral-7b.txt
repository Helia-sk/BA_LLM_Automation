 Tag: Conversion

Reason: The user initiated a task (navigating to the customer dashboard) and completed it by scrolling through the entire page. Subsequently, the user navigated to another page (customer/dashboard/<id>) and performed additional actions, indicating engagement and completion of another task.

1) [Step 1] The session begins with the user navigating to the customer dashboard ("/customer/dashboard").
2) [Step 2] The user scrolls through the entire page, which indicates initial engagement with the content.
3) [Step 3] The user navigates to a specific page within the customer dashboard (customer/dashboard/<id>), further demonstrating intent and engagement.
4) [Step 4] The user continues to interact with the new page by scrolling through it, showing continued interest in the content.
5) [Step 5] The session ends without any further actions, implying that the user has completed their intended task on this specific page. However, since there is no evidence of abandonment or lack of engagement across all initiated tasks, we can conclude that this was a conversion.
