 Tag: Conversion

Reason: The user initiated several tasks related to the Customer Login process, including clicking on the "Customer Login" link and filling in their username and password. They also clicked on the username input field twice (once for debounced_input event and once for click event), but this does not indicate an abandonment of the task as it could be a user correcting their input. Finally, they submitted their login credentials by clicking on the password input field.

1) The user visited the homepage (http://localhost:5173/).
2) The user clicked on the "Customer Login" link located at x = 1647 and y = 35.
3) The user navigated to the Customer Login page (http://localhost:5173/customer/login).
4) The user clicked on the username input field (x = 997, y = 292).
5) The user entered their username by typing "User1" into the username input field.
6) The user clicked on the password input field for debounced_input event (x = 997, y = 308).
7) The user entered their password by typing their credentials into the password input field.
8) The user submitted their login credentials by clicking on the password input field for click event (x = 997, y = 308).

The fact that the user completed all initiated tasks related to the Customer Login process indicates a conversion.
