==================================================

 Tag: Conversion

Reason: The user initiated a task (navigation to the Restaurants page from the dashboard) and subsequently completed another task (scrolling down on the Restaurants page to view details of a restaurant). Although there was an abandoned scroll event further down on the Restaurants page, it is reasonable to assume that this could have been due to reaching the end of the content or the user deciding to take further action elsewhere.

User Journey:
1) [Step 1] The user navigates from the homepage (dashboard) to the Restaurants page by clicking on the "Restaurants" link.
2) [Step 2] Upon reaching the Restaurants page, the user scrolls down to view restaurant details.
3) [Step 3] The user interacts with a specific restaurant's image by clicking on it, which could potentially indicate an interest in that restaurant.
4) [Step 4] After interacting with the restaurant's image, there is evidence of a scroll event further down on the Restaurants page, but it remains unclear whether this was completed or abandoned. However, since another task (interacting with the restaurant's image) was successfully completed, it can be inferred that the user might have decided to take further action elsewhere rather than abandoning the session entirely.
5) [Step 5] (Assumed based on no further evidence) The user navigates away from the Restaurants page, potentially to view more details about the selected restaurant or make a reservation.
