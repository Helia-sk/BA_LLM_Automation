==================================================

 Tag: Conversion
   Reason: All initiated tasks were completed. The user made an HTTP request to accept an order on the backend, and then on the frontend, clicked a button labeled "Accept". This action indicates that the user has completed the process of accepting an order.

   Step-by-step user journey:
   1) [Step 1] The session started with an HTTP request (log_04cc6eb7-92ae-42c6-b7cb-3f775a0b688a) from the backend to accept an order.
   2) [Step 2] A preliminary OPTIONS request was sent from the backend (log_d574513a-4ec9-43d8-9580-9e8634754b75), which is a common practice to check for allowed methods before performing the main operation.
   3) [Step 3] The main HTTP POST request was sent from the backend (log_eed6c637-536a-43da-8a27-e93d3347b1d7), which successfully accepted the order with a status code of 200.
   4) [Step 4] On the frontend, the user initiated another click event on the button labeled "Accept" (log_1758985714781_tw6p4axzk), which indicates that they have confirmed the acceptance of the order. This action completes the user journey, as the user has successfully accepted an order on both the backend and frontend.
