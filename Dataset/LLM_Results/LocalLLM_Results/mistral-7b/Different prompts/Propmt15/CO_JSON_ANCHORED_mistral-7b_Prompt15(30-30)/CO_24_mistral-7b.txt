 Tag: Conversion

Reasons for Classification: The session started with a click on the "Menu" link (Log 10), then a click on the form containing the image drag and upload area (Log 9). Following that, there were multiple clicks within the form, indicating an attempt to interact with the form. The final interaction was a click outside of the form (Log 7), which is not necessarily a drop-off as the user might have just navigated away from the form without submitting it. However, since no further interactions were recorded after this, it can be assumed that the user completed their intended task within the form, thus making it a conversion.

User Journey:
1) The user clicked on the "Menu" link (Log 10).
2) The user interacted with the image drag and upload area within the form (Log 9).
3) The user made multiple clicks within the form, suggesting an attempt to fill out the form (Logs 8, 6, 5, 4).
4) The user clicked outside of the form, possibly indicating completion or submission of the form (Log 7).
5) No further interactions were recorded after this action.

Since all initiated tasks were completed and no abandonment was observed after the completion of the last task, this session can be classified as a conversion.
