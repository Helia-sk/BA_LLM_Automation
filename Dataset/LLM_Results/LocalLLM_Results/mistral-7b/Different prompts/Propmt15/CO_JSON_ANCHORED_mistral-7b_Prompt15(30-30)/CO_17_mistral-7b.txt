 Tag: Conversion

Reason: The user initiated tasks (navigation to Restaurants page, scrolling down to a restaurant, and clicking on the "View Restaurant" button) were all completed. This indicates that the user intended to complete the task of viewing a restaurant details page, which is considered a conversion in this context.

User Journey:
1) [Step 1] The user navigated to the homepage (/customer/dashboard).
2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "Restaurants" link located at position (394, 128).
3) [Step 3] The user scrolled down the Restaurants page.
4) [Step 4] The user scrolled to the specific restaurant and clicked on its image, which was labeled as "No image available". This triggered a click event on the restaurant's details link.
5) [Step 5] The user viewed the restaurant's details page (/customer/dashboard/restaurant/9).
6) [Step 6] The user clicked on the button labeled as "Add to cart" or "View Cart", which is not explicitly shown in the logs provided. However, since the user was able to navigate and interact with the elements on the restaurant's details page, it can be assumed that this action (add to cart or view cart) was completed as well, indicating a conversion.
