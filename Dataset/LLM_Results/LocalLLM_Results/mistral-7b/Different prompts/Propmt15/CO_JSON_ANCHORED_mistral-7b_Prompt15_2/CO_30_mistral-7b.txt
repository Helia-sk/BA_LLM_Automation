 Tag: Conversion

Reason: The user initiated multiple tasks (clicking on "History", then "View Details") and completed these tasks (by clicking "View Details" again to close the details view), indicating interaction and engagement with the application. No evidence was found of the session being abandoned or any task left uncompleted.

2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "History" link to navigate to the history section ("http://localhost:5173/restaurant/dashboard/history").
3) [Step 3] Upon arriving at the history page, the user clicked on a specific history item to view details.
4) [Step 4] The user then clicked on "View Details" again (presumably to close the detailed view). This indicates that the user has completed their intended task and likely found the information they were looking for, leading to a successful conversion.
