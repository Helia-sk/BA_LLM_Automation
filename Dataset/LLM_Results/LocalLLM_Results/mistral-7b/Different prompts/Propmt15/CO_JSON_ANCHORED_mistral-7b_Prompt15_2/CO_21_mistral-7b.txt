 Tag: Conversion

Reason: The session was initiated with a user navigating to the restaurant dashboard page (log 6). This indicates that the user has already interacted with the platform in some capacity. After that, the user clicked on the "Restaurant Partners" link to either register or log in to manage orders (log 5), which is an expected action if the goal is to use the platform. The user then navigated to the login page by clicking on the "username" input field (log 4). After that, the user entered their credentials and clicked the submit button, indicating a successful login (implied but not explicitly logged). Finally, the user navigated away from the login page (log 1), which is expected behavior once a user has successfully logged in to manage their account. Since all initiated tasks were completed, this session can be classified as a conversion.
