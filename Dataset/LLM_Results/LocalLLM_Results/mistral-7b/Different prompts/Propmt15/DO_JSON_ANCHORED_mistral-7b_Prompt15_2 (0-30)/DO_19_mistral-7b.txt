 Tag: Conversion

Reason: The user initiated the task of navigating to the Restaurant Partners page, clicked on the "Register your restaurant or log in to manage orders" link, then clicked on the username input field and entered "User1". After that, the user clicked on the password input field and did not complete any other actions. However, since the user eventually submitted the login form by clicking the submit button (as indicated by the last two logs), we can classify this session as a conversion.

1) The user initiated the task of navigating to the Restaurant Partners page (http://localhost:5173/restaurant/login).
2) The user clicked on the "Register your restaurant or log in to manage orders" link.
3) The user clicked on the username input field and entered "User1".
4) The user clicked on the password input field, but did not enter a password.
5) The user submitted the login form by clicking the submit button, which indicates successful login.
