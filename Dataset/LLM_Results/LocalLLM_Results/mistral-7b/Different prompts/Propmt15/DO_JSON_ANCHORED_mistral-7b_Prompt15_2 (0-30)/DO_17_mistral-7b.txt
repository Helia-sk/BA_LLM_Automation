 Tag: Conversion

Reason: The user completed all initiated tasks in this session. They clicked on the "Restaurant Partners" text, then they navigated to the login form by clicking on it twice (possibly a mistake), and finally they entered their username into the username input field before leaving the page.

User Journey:
1) The user landed on the Restaurant Partners login page by clicking on the "Restaurant Partners" text.
2) They initiated the login process by clicking on the login form.
3) They clicked on the login form again (possibly a mistake), indicating they might have intended to fill in their username.
4) The user entered their username into the username input field.
5) They left the page without completing the login process, but since they initiated and completed step 4, we can consider this a successful conversion for login form interaction.
