==================================================

 Tag: Conversion

Reason: The user initiated two tasks (clicking on "Orders" and then "Menu") and completed both of them by clicking on the "Menu" button, indicating an interaction with the desired destination.

1) The user navigated to the restaurant dashboard page (/restaurant/dashboard).
2) The user clicked on the "Orders" link in the navigation menu.
3) The user then clicked on the "Menu" link within the restaurant dashboard, indicating a change of context or section within the dashboard.
4) Finally, the user interacted with the "Menu" button, likely to view the menu items for the restaurant. This action completes the user's journey as they have now reached their intended goal (viewing the menu).

The user's interaction with the "Orders" and "Menu" links suggests a deliberate navigation towards the desired destination, which is viewing the menu. The completion of the final action ("Menu" button click) further confirms this as a conversion scenario, where the user has reached their intended goal and interacted with the desired content (the menu).
