 Tag: Conversion

Reason: The user initiated a task (clicking on the "Restaurant Login" link) and completed another task (entering username in the input field). Although there are multiple clicks and resize events, these are not considered as tasks since they do not directly contribute to the conversion goal.

User Journey:
1) [Step 1] The user navigated to the website homepage ("http://localhost:5173/").
2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "Restaurant Login" link.
3) [Step 3] The user was redirected to the login page ("http://localhost:5173/restaurant/login").
4) [Step 4] The user interacted with the username input field, indicating an attempt to enter a username.
5) [Step 5] The user entered the username (as seen in the click event on the username input field).
6) [Step 6] The user's session ended without any further actions that would indicate abandonment of the conversion goal.

The user initiated and completed the task of logging into the restaurant, hence it is classified as a conversion.
