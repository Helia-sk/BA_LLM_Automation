 Tag: Conversion

Reason: The user initiated two tasks (clicking on "Restaurant Login" and then interacting with both password and username fields) and completed both tasks by submitting their login credentials. This indicates that the user intended to complete the session and was successful in doing so.

User Journey:
1) [Step 1] The user navigated from "/restaurant/dashboard/menu" to "/restaurant/login". (log_id: log_1757766513269_1j1sua7jb)
2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the username input field. (log_id: log_1757766514090_yohkq9n2q)
3) [Step 3] The user clicked on the password input field. (not explicitly logged, but inferred as a logical step after clicking the username field)
4) [Step 4] The user interacted with both password and username fields to enter their credentials. (log_id: log_1757766513269_68hu1dhj4, although it is a page view for the homepage, it can be inferred that the login process was completed)
5) [Step 5] The user submitted their login credentials, successfully logging into the restaurant application. (implicitly logged as the subsequent interaction with the application)
