 Tag: Conversion

Reason: The user initiated a form submit action (log 5), which indicates an attempt to log in. After that, the user filled out the password field and triggered a blur event (logs 6 & 7). These actions show that the user completed the intended task of logging in, so it is considered a conversion.

User Journey:
1) [Step 1] The user navigated to the restaurant's login page (implicit, as this is the first log).
2) [Step 2] The user entered their username (not explicitly logged, but assumed since they proceeded to enter a password).
3) [Step 3] The user entered their password and triggered a submit event (log 5), indicating an attempt to log in.
4) [Step 4] The user filled out the password field and triggered a blur event (logs 6 & 7), which suggests that they have successfully logged in, completing the intended task.
