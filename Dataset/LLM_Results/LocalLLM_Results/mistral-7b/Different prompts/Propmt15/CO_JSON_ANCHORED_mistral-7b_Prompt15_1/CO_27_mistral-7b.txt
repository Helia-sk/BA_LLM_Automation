 Tag: Conversion

Reason: The user initiated an action (accepting an order) on the backend system and completed it, as indicated by the successful HTTP response with status code 200. Additionally, the user interacted with the frontend application, indicating engagement.

User Journey:

1) [Step 1] The user made a request to accept an order (HTTP Request) using the Chrome browser on Windows 10, with the User-Agent "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/140.0.0.0 Safari/537.36". This request was for the endpoint "orders.accept_order".

2) [Step 2] The backend server responded with an OPTIONS method to preflight the request, indicating that it was preparing to handle the incoming POST request.

3) [Step 3] The user's browser then made another HTTP Request, this time a POST request for the same endpoint "orders.accept_order". This indicates that the user is proceeding with accepting the order.

4) [Step 4] The backend server responded with an HTTP Response (200 status code), confirming that the order was accepted successfully.

5) [Step 5] Simultaneously, on the frontend application, the user clicked a "Accept" button, as recorded in the click event log.

6) [Step 6] The user's interaction with the frontend application ended with another click event, this time on an SVG element, but this does not seem to be directly related to accepting the order.

The fact that all initiated tasks were completed (accepting the order on both backend and frontend) indicates a successful conversion. The user journey can be summarized as: The user accepted an order successfully on both the backend and frontend applications, indicating a conversion.
