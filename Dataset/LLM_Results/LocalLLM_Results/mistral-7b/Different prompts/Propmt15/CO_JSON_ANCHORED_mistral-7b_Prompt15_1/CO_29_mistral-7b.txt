==================================================

 Tag: Conversion

Reason: The user initiated tasks (Viewing History, Clicking on a specific history item to view details, and then closing the details) and completed them by clicking on "X" to close the details. However, the user did not complete the final task (closing the session), but this is not enough for it to be considered a drop-off as all initiated tasks were completed before that.

User Journey:
1) [Step 1] The user navigated to the History page ("History" link clicked).
2) [Step 2] The user selected a specific history item to view details by clicking on it.
3) [Step 3] The user viewed the details of the selected history item.
4) [Step 4] The user closed the details by clicking on "X".
5) [Step 5] (Not performed in the logs, but could be assumed that the user did not perform this step - closing the session). However, as all initiated tasks were completed before this step, it does not change the classification to drop-off.
