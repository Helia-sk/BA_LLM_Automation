 Tag: Conversion

Reason: The user initiated a task by navigating to the customer dashboard (log 9), then scrolled through the page, which indicates an engagement with the content. After that, they clicked on a link to navigate to the customer dashboard for a specific restaurant (log 4). This action is considered a continuation of the initial task. The user then navigated back to the customer dashboard (log 5), possibly to check something or compare options, and finally, they clicked on another link to navigate to the specific restaurant's details page (log 3). Since all initiated tasks were completed (navigating to the customer dashboard, a specific restaurant's page, and then back), this session can be classified as a conversion.

1) The user navigated to the customer dashboard (log 9)
2) The user scrolled through the customer dashboard (implied by "scroll" event in log 9)
3) The user clicked on a link to navigate to a specific restaurant's page (log 4)
4) The user navigated back to the customer dashboard (log 5)
5) The user clicked on another link to navigate to the specific restaurant's details page (log 3)
