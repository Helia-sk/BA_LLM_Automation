 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user initiated the login process, but the session ended without completing the task.

   Step-by-step User Journey:
   1) The user clicked on the "Hungry? Order delicious food from local restaurants" call-to-action (CTA), indicating interest in the service.
   2) The user navigated to the login page, initiating a potential conversion.
   3) The user entered their username ("User1"), indicating further engagement with the login process.
   4) The user clicked on the username field, suggesting they might be selecting or adjusting their input, but no further action was recorded.
   5) The user clicked on the password field, again without entering any data.
   6) The user did not complete the login process by clicking the submit button or taking any other actions that would indicate a successful login attempt. Instead, the session ended.
   As the user initiated a task (login) but did not complete it, this session can be classified as a drop-off.
