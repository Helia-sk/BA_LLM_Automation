 Tag: Conversion
   Reason: The session appears to have started at the main dashboard (log_1758982604462_ioozd23aj), then the user clicked on "Restaurants" (log_1758982603092_w1w3zu62e) to navigate to a new page. After that, the user scrolled down within this Restaurant page (log_1758982604462_tqfz6dfz0 and log_1758982603092_w1w3zu62e), which suggests they were exploring the content. Next, the user scrolled up again (log_175898260543_ihfn2uln7) before clicking on a specific restaurant (log_1758982605543_4jbgj95zx), indicating they selected a restaurant to view. Subsequently, the user scrolled down within this restaurant's page again (log_1758982605646_dfz0 and log_1758982605543_ihfn2uln7), which suggests they were viewing more details about the selected restaurant. Finally, the user scrolled up one last time (log_1758982605543_ihfn2uln7) before performing an action on the cart or checkout process, which is not shown in the logs, but this action could be considered a completion of a task, suggesting a possible conversion.
