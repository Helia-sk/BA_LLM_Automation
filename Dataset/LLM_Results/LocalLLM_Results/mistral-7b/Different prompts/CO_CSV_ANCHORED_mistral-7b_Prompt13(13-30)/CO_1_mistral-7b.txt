==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The session initiated with the user clicking on "Customer Login" but it appears that no further tasks were completed, such as entering a username or password, which indicates an abandonment of the intended task.

   Step-by-step User Journey:
   1) [Step 1] The user navigated to the customer login page (indicated by log_1757772472157_hcra1onsw).
   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "Customer Login" button (indicated by log_1757772473391_2bzxxm2il). This could be considered as the initiation of a task.
   3) [Step 3] The user clicked on the username input field (indicated by log_1757772472157_hcra1onsw), but it is unclear if any text was entered. This could potentially be the first step of entering a username, but since no further steps were completed, we cannot confirm this.
   4) [Step 4] The user clicked on the password input field (indicated by log_1757772473391_2bzxxm2il), but again, it is unclear if any text was entered. This could potentially be the first step of entering a password, but since no further steps were completed, we cannot confirm this.
   5) [Step 5] The session ended (indicated by the absence of further logs). Since the intended task (logging in as a customer) was not fully completed, we classify this as a drop-off.
