==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The session initiated with the user clicking on the "Customer Login" link, but it appears that the user did not complete the subsequent steps of filling out the username or password fields. This is evident from the logs showing multiple click events on the username and password input fields, but no corresponding input_change events indicating the user entered a value.

   User Journey:
   1) [Step 1] The user navigated to the /customer/login page (log_1757773371689_3ak46jhcx).
   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "Customer Login" button (log_1757773372596_2oj0c59xu).
   3) [Step 3] The user navigated to the username input field (log_1757773373072_scoku9tbi). However, no corresponding input_change event was recorded, suggesting that the user did not enter a value in the username field.
   4) [Step 4] The user navigated back to the "Customer Login" button (log_1757773372596_qk2cml25q).
   5) [Step 5] The user clicked on the password input field (log_1757773373072_l45tbs735), but again, no corresponding input_change event was recorded, indicating that the user did not enter a value in the password field.
   6) [Step 6] The user navigated back to the username input field (log_1757773373072_scoku9tbi). This suggests that the user may have wanted to correct a mistake or reconsider their action, but no subsequent actions were taken before the session ended.

This user journey indicates that the initiated task of logging in was abandoned, making this a drop-off session.
