   Reason: The session started with a click on the "Customer Login" button, but there was no subsequent action indicating that the user filled out the username or password fields, or clicked the "Sign in" button. The user also clicked on the link saying "Already have an account? Sign in", which indicates they might have been considering creating an account instead of logging in, but again, there's no further action to confirm this.

   Step-by-step user journey:
   1) The user navigated to the customer login page (/customer/login).
   2) The user clicked on the "Customer Login" button.
   3) The user clicked on the link saying "Already have an account? Sign in".
   4) The user clicked on the username input field, but there's no record of them entering a username or password.
   5) The user did not click on the "Sign in" button to submit their login details.
   6) The session ended without any further interaction.
