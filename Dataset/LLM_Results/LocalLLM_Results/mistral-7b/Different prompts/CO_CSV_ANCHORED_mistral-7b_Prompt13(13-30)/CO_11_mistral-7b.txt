 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The session started at the customer dashboard, but there was a scroll event indicating that the user navigated through the page. However, after this initial interaction, there were no further interactions or tasks completed, such as clicking on a restaurant, placing an order, or any other action that could be considered a conversion. The last event in the log file is a scroll event at the customer dashboard, which suggests that the user might have left the page without taking any further action.
