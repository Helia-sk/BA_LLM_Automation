==================================================

 Tag: Conversion
   Reason: The session shows a clear sequence of initiated tasks that were fully completed, with the user navigating from the dashboard to the history page and then initiating an action on the details button. This indicates that the user intended to complete a task and successfully did so, making this a conversion event.

   User Journey:
   1) [Step 1] The user initiated a session (log_1758986435792_vg05snfan). They were on the restaurant dashboard page (/restaurant/dashboard).
   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "History" link in the dashboard, navigating to the history page (log_1758986443885_ebam3884s).
   3) [Step 3] The user clicked on a specific item in the history list, which triggered the view details action (log_1758986445667_767la5ed5).
   4) [Step 4] The user then clicked on the "View Details" button to open the details page (not explicitly logged but implied as the next step in the sequence).
   5) [Step 5] After viewing the details, the user decided to close or leave the details section by clicking the "X" button (log_1758986449152_c1joj5i8c). This action does not count as an abandonment because it's a natural step in the process of reviewing and leaving the details page.
   6) [Step 6] The user then left the history page by clicking the "X" button again (log_1758986449620_z80nj1qmw), effectively ending the session.
