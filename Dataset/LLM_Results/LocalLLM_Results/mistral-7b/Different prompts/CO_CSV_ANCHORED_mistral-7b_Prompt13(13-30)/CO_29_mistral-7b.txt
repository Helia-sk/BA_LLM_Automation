==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user initiated the following tasks but did not complete all of them, indicating that they dropped off at some point.

   Step-by-step User Journey:
   1) [Step 1] The user accessed the dashboard homepage (/restaurant/dashboard/) and clicked on "History". This indicates an initiated task.
   2) [Step 2] Upon reaching the history page, the user viewed a list of items but did not interact with any further, indicating no action taken towards completion.
   3) [Step 3] The user then clicked on "X" to close the history page, suggesting they may have intended to return later but did not do so.
   4) [Step 4] The user navigated from the history page to the balance page (/restaurant/dashboard/balance), indicating another initiated task.
   5) [Step 5] On the balance page, the user did not interact further, suggesting no action taken towards completion.
   6) [Step 6] The user then navigated back to the dashboard homepage (/restaurant/dashboard/) and clicked on "Balance" again, but this time they also did not interact further, indicating no action taken towards completion.
   7) [Step 7] Lastly, the user navigated to the history page once more (/restaurant/dashboard/history), clicked on "View Details" for an item, and then did not interact further, suggesting no action taken towards completion. This is the last action recorded in the log file, and it appears that the user dropped off at this point without completing any of their initiated tasks fully.
