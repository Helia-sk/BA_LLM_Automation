   Reason: The user initiated the task of navigating to the customer login page, but did not complete it by clicking the "Customer Login" button. The subsequent logs show no further interaction with any other tasks on the site.

   User Journey Step-by-step:
   1) [Step 1] - The user was using a web browser version 537.36 of Chrome, running on Windows NT 10.0. The user was previously on a page titled "Restaurant Dashboard Settings" at http://localhost:5173/restaurant/dashboard/settings.
   2) [Step 2] - At time 2025-09-27T14:19:05.841Z, the user navigated to the home page (http://localhost:5173/) via a "navigation" event.
   3) [Step 3] - The user then clicked on the "Customer Login" link located at x=1659, y=19, which took them to the customer login page (http://localhost:5173/customer/login).
   4) [Step 4] - At time 2025-09-27T14:19:06.939Z, the user clicked on the customer login input field for username, but did not proceed to enter any data or click the submit button.
   5) [Step 5] - There are no further logs indicating any additional interaction with the site, so it can be inferred that the user left the page and did not complete the task of logging in as a customer.
