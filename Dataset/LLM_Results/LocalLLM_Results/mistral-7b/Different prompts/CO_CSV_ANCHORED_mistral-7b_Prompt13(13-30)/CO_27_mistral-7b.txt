 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The session was initiated with a http_request on /api/orders/26/accept but no corresponding http_response was found, indicating that the task (accepting an order in this case) was not completed.

   User Journey:
   1) [Step 1] Start of the session with an anonymous user using version 1.4.2 of the web application on a desktop browser at localhost:5173/restaurant/dashboard (frontend).
   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "Accept" button on the dashboard, initiating a task to accept an order. However, this action did not receive a corresponding http_response, suggesting that the server did not acknowledge or complete the request.
   3) [Step 3] The user then clicked on the same location (/restaurant/dashboard), likely attempting another interaction, but again no http_response was received to confirm completion of any initiated tasks.
   4) [Step 4] The session ended with no further interactions or completed tasks.
