==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The session does not appear to have completed any tasks initiated. All logged events are HTTP requests and responses related to loading the menu, scrolling, and clicking on a menu item without any subsequent events indicating completion of a task.

   User Journey Step-by-step:
   1) [Step 1] The user (anonymous session_1758984560651_foqjcq8xf) accessed the restaurant dashboard menu page at /restaurant/dashboard/menu from the frontend.
   2) [Step 2] At 2025-09-27T15:03:48.136616, the user made a HTTP request to fetch the menu data from the backend (log_1758985435886_b6d6e7eb).
   3) [Step 3] At 2025-09-27T15:03:48.147457, the user received a response (log_1758985435886_1cc530ca) containing the menu data from the backend.
   4) [Step 4] At 2025-09-27T15:03:51.599Z, the user scrolled down the page (log_1758985431599_ioqmc3uaa).
   5) [Step 5] At 2025-09-27T15:03:51.600Z, the user scrolled again (log_1758985431599_x7th5obah).
   6) [Step 6] At 2025-09-27T15:03:55.886Z, the user clicked on the menu item (log_1758985435886_4l55g8a0y), but no subsequent events were logged indicating that the task associated with this click was completed.
   7) [Step 7] At an unknown timestamp, the user left the page without any additional interactions. The last event (log_1758985435886_syahy4yoi) indicates a click event, but it's not clear whether this was the action that caused the user to leave the page or if it was another subsequent interaction. However, based on the lack of any completion events for the initiated tasks, we can infer that the user left the page without completing any tasks.
