 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: Although the user performed a form submission (sign-in attempt), they did not complete any initiated tasks afterwards, specifically interacting with the "/restaurant/dashboard" page or making an API request. Instead, they navigated to the "/restaurant/login" page again and filled in their credentials but did not proceed further.

   User Journey:
   1) [Step 1] The user accessed the restaurant's website (/restaurant).
   2) [Step 2] The user navigated to the login page (/restaurant/login) and entered their credentials.
   3) [Step 3] The user submitted the form (form_submit.v2), indicating a sign-in attempt.
   4) [Step 4] The user changed the password input value, but this was not a confirmed sign-in action as they did not proceed to the dashboard page or perform any API requests.
   5) [Step 5] Instead of moving forward, the user returned to the login page (/restaurant/login), indicating that they may have encountered an issue during the sign-in process and chose to reattempt it without success.
