 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The session was initiated by navigating to the "/customer/dashboard" page, and the user scrolled down. However, the user did not complete any of the tasks initiated on this page (no task count is provided in the logs), indicating an abandonment of actions.

   User Journey Step-by-step:
   1) [Step 1] The user initiated a session by navigating to the "/customer/dashboard" page.
   2) [Step 2] The user scrolled down the page to reach the y-coordinate of 0, indicating they were at the top of the page again or had reached the bottom.
   3) [Step 3] The user did not perform any actions that could be considered a completed task on this page. This includes clicking elements, filling forms, etc. Instead, the user scrolled back up to the y-coordinate of 0, which suggests an abandonment of further interaction with the page.
   4) [Step 4] The session ended without any completed tasks.
