==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off

Reason: The session ended without any interaction with the "Restaurants" link, which suggests that the user did not navigate to the Restaurants page.

Here's the user journey step-by-step:
1) [Step 1] The user visits the customer dashboard (/customer/dashboard).
2) [Step 2] The user scrolls down on the dashboard page.
3) [Step 3] The user clicks on a "Restaurants" link, but there seems to be no corresponding event in the log file, indicating that the user may have not fully interacted with this link or navigated away from the page without clicking it.
4) [Step 4] No further interactions were recorded, suggesting that the user did not proceed to any other pages or complete any tasks. This indicates a drop-off as the initiated task (clicking on the "Restaurants" link) was abandoned.
