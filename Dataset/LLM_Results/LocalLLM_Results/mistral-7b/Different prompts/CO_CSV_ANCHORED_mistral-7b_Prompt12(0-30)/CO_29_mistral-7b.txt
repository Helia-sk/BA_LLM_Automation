==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The session started by navigating to the "/restaurant/dashboard/history" page, but the user didn't complete any of the initiated tasks. Instead, they clicked on the "X" button (indicating they wanted to close a window or cancel an action), and then left the history section without performing any further actions.

   User Journey:
   1) [Step 1] The user initiated a session by navigating to the "/restaurant/dashboard/history" page, indicating an interest in viewing their transaction history.
   2) [Step 2] Upon reaching the history section, the user clicked on the "X" button, which typically indicates they wanted to close a window or cancel an action. This suggests that the user might have decided not to view their transaction history at this point.
   3) [Step 3] After clicking the "X" button, no further actions were initiated by the user, indicating that they left the history section without performing any other tasks. This lack of follow-through is a clear sign that the session resulted in a drop-off.
