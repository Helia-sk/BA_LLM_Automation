 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The session was initiated with a click on the "Restaurant Login" link, but the user did not complete the login process by entering a username or password. Since the user didn't perform any actions that could be considered a conversion (login), and the session was abandoned without completing the intended task, it is classified as a drop-off.

   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "Restaurant Login" link to initiate the login process.
   3) [Step 3] The user did not enter a username or password, indicating an abandonment of the login process.
