Prompt: Analyze the log file Read the events from the end toward the beginning and focus on the final outcome.. Determine if the session was a drop-off, a conversion.Consider every initiated task, A task counts as a conversion only if it is fully completed. If all initiated tasks are completed → Tag: Conversion. If even one initiated tasks are abandoned → Tag: Drop-Off. Provide a reason for your classification. Then, outline the user journey step-by-step.Format your response as follows: Tag: Conversion||Drop-Off  [Reason]. 1) [Step 1] 2) [Step 2] 3) [Step 3] …
==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The session did not result in a conversion because the user only performed an initial click on the "Customer Login" button, but did not complete the login process or any other subsequent tasks.

   User Journey Step-by-step:
   1) [Step 1] The user navigated to the "/customer/login" page (log_1757773371689_3ak46jhcx).
   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "Customer Login" button (log_1757773372596_2oj0c59xu).
   3) [Step 3] The user clicked on the "Username" input field (log_1757773373072_scoku9tbi).
   4) [Step 4] The user clicked outside of the "Username" input field, presumably to focus on the "Password" field, but this event is not recorded in the log (assumption based on typical login flow).
   5) [Step 5] The user did not perform any subsequent events related to the login process or any other tasks on the page, indicating that they abandoned the session.
