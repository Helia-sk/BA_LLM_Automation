==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The session was initiated with a login attempt, but the user did not complete the form submission by entering a username and password. Instead, the user only entered a password, which is indicated by the "input_change.v1" event for the password field, but no subsequent event for the username field was recorded. This suggests that the user abandoned the session before completing the login process.

   User Journey:
   1) [Step 1] The user navigated to the restaurant login page (indicated by the "/restaurant/login" URL).
   2) [Step 2] The user clicked the "Sign In" button, initiating a login attempt.
   3) [Step 3] The user entered a password in the password field, but did not complete the form submission by entering a username as well. This step indicates that the user abandoned the session before completing the login process.
