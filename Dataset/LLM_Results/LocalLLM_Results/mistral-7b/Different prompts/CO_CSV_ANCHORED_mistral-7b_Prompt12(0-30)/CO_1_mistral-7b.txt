 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: Although the user initiated multiple tasks, such as entering a username and clicking on the "Customer Login" button, they did not complete the final step which is submitting the login credentials by entering a password. This indicates that the session was abandoned without completing the intended task (logging in).

User Journey Step-by-step:
1) [Step 1] The user accessed the customer login page at "http://localhost:5173/customer/login".
2) [Step 2] The user entered a username ("User1") in the "username" field.
3) [Step 3] The user clicked on the "Customer Login" button (which triggered the click event). However, they did not enter a password, which is required to complete the login process.
4) [Step 4] The session ended without the user submitting their login credentials, indicating that the intended task was not completed and the session was abandoned.
