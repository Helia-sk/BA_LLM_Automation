==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user initiated the task of logging into the customer area, but did not complete it. Instead, they clicked on various elements (username input field, username label, and login button), indicating an attempt to enter their credentials, but there is no subsequent event showing them actually submitting the form. This suggests that they may have abandoned the process before completion.

   User Journey:
   1) The user navigated to the customer login page (/customer/login).
   2) The user clicked on the "Username" label, suggesting an attempt to select the username input field.
   3) The user clicked on the username input field, indicating an attempt to enter their username.
   4) The user did not take any further action related to entering their password or submitting the login form, which suggests they may have abandoned the process.
