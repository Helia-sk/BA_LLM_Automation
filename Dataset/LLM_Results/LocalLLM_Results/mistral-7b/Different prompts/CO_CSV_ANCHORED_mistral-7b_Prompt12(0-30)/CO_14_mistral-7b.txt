==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The session was initiated with a user navigating to the Customer Login page, but no other actions were completed after clicking the "Customer Login" link. This indicates that the user did not complete the login process or any subsequent tasks on the site.

   User Journey:
   1) The user visited the customer login page (/customer/login).
   2) The user clicked on the "Customer Login" link, which is indicated by a click event. However, no further events were recorded, suggesting that the user did not proceed with the login process or engage in any other actions on the site.
   This lack of additional interactions indicates that the session was dropped off after the initial click on the Customer Login link.
