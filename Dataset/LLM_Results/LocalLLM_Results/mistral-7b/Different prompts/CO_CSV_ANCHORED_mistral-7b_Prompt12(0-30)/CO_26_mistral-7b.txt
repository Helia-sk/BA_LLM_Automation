Determine if the session was a drop-off, a conversion.Consider every initiated task, A task counts as a conversion only if it is fully completed.

==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user initiated tasks, such as clicking on the "Add Item" button and selecting an item, but did not complete any task fully. Specifically, the user did not upload or input any new menu item.

   User Journey:
   1) [Step 1] The user navigated to the restaurant's dashboard page at `http://localhost:5173/restaurant/dashboard/menu`.
   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "Add Item" button located at coordinates (1505, 185).
   3) [Step 3] The user selected an item to add by clicking on it. However, the log does not show any subsequent action that would indicate uploading or inputting a new menu item.
   4) [Step 4] The user clicked on the "Salad" item, but again, no further action was taken to complete the task of adding a new item.
   Therefore, this session is classified as a drop-off because the initiated task (adding a new item) was not completed.
