==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off

Reason: The session was not a conversion because the user did not complete any initiated tasks. Although the user clicked on the "Customer Login" button, they did not enter any data in either the username or password fields, and neither field recorded any input changes after that initial click event.

User Journey:
1) [Step 1] The user navigated to the customer login page.
2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "Customer Login" button.
3) [Step 3] The user did not enter any data in either the username or password fields, indicating they may have intended to log in but ultimately decided not to proceed further with the process.
4) [The session ended without any additional interactions.]
