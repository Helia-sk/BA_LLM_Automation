 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The session was not a conversion because the user did not complete all initiated tasks. The user clicked on the "Restaurant Login" link, but there is no subsequent event indicating that they successfully logged in or completed any other actions (such as filling out a form or making a purchase).

   User Journey:
   1) [Step 1] The user navigated to the "/restaurant/login" page.
   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "Restaurant Login" link, indicating that they wanted to log in.
   3) [Step 3] There is no subsequent event indicating that the user successfully logged in or completed any other tasks on the page. Therefore, it appears that the user did not complete their intended action and may have left the site (drop-off).
