 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The session started from the homepage (/customer/dashboard), where the user clicked on "Restaurants". This could be considered as a initiated task. However, the user did not proceed to any specific restaurant page, but instead scrolled down the homepage and then scrolled up again (indicating potential confusion or lack of interest). The user then navigated to the restaurant detail page (/customer/dashboard/restaurant/9) by clicking on a restaurant card. However, no further interactions were observed on this page, such as adding the restaurant to the cart, writing a review, or performing any other actions that could be considered as completion of a task. After a few seconds, the user scrolled up and left the page (indicating abandonment).
