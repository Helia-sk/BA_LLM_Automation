 Tag: Drop-Off

   Reason: The user initiated the task of clicking on the "Customer Login" link, but did not complete the login process by providing a username and password. This indicates that the session was dropped off before the intended goal was reached.

   1) [Step 1] The user visited the home page (url: http://localhost:5173/).
   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "Customer Login" link located at x=627, y=38.
   3) [Step 3] The user focused on the username input field by clicking on it (x=515, y=306). However, the user did not provide any input in the field, indicating that they may have intended to log in but chose not to do so.
   4) [Step 4] The user clicked outside of the username input field, but again did not provide any input in the password field or submit the form.
   5) [Step 5] The user clicked on a blank div element (x=563, y=289), possibly moving the cursor to a different location on the page.
   6) [Step 6] The user did not perform any further actions in the log file that indicate completion of the intended task (logging in).

   It is important to note that while the user clicked on various elements throughout the session, none of these interactions were necessary for completing the login process. Therefore, the session can be classified as a drop-off since the primary initiated task was not completed.
