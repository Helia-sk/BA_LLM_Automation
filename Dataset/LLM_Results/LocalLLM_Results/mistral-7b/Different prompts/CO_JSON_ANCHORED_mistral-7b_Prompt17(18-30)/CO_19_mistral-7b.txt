 Tag: Drop-Off

Reason: One of the initiated tasks was abandoned. In this case, the user clicked on the "Customer Login" link (initiated task), but did not complete the login process by clicking on the username input field after that. The session ended without any further interaction related to the login process.

1) [Step 1] - User navigated from the restaurant dashboard settings page to the customer login page (indicated by the "navigation" event for "/customer/login").
2) [Step 2] - The user clicked on the "Customer Login" link (indicated by the "click" event on the element with text "Customer Login").
3) [Step 3] - The user did not interact with any other elements related to the login process, such as the username or password input fields, which were clicked later in the session (indicated by the subsequent "click" events). This suggests that the user decided not to proceed with the login.
4) [Step 4] - The user left the customer login page without completing the login process (no further interactions were recorded after the initial click on the username input field).
