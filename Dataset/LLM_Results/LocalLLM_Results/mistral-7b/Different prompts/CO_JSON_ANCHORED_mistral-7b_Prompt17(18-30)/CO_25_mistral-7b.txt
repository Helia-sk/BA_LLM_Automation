 Tag: Conversion

   Reason: All initiated tasks have been completed. The user clicked on the "Menu" link, which led to the menu page (indicated by the click event with a tag of `log_1758985428126_s76qbxnch`). After that, the user scrolled through the menu (indicated by the scroll event with an id of `log_1758985431599_ioqmc3uaa`). Finally, the user performed a click event on an element within the menu page (indicated by the click event with an id of `log_1758985435886_4l55g8a0y`), which is considered as a completed task in this context.

   1) The user accessed the restaurant's dashboard page (indicated by the URL).
   2) The user clicked on the "Menu" link, navigating to the menu page.
   3) The user scrolled through the menu items on the page.
   4) The user performed an action (likely selecting a menu item or placing an order) on the menu page, which is not explicitly shown in the log file but can be inferred as it's a completed task and the session ended after this event.
