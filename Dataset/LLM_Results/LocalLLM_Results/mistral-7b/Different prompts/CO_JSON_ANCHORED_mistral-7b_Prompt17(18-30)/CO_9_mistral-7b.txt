 Tag: Drop-Off

   Reason: The user initiated a scroll event on the restaurant page (4th log), but did not interact with any other elements before leaving the page, indicating abandonment of that task. However, since there is no clear indication of an initial intent to complete any subsequent tasks, it is not possible to definitively classify this session as a drop-off or conversion based on the provided logs alone.

   User Journey:
   1) [Step 1] The user navigated to the customer dashboard page (1st log).
   2) [Step 2] The user scrolled down the page (2nd log), presumably looking for options or content.
   3) [Step 3] The user navigated to a specific restaurant page (3rd log, session_1757771443548_7eqjj0e9b).
   4) [Step 4] The user scrolled down the restaurant page (4th log), but did not interact with any other elements.
   5) [Step 5] The user scrolled back to the top of the restaurant page (5th log).
   6) [Step 6] The user scrolled down the restaurant page again (6th log), possibly reconsidering interaction, but still did not engage with any other elements before leaving the page (7th log).
