 Tag: Conversion

   Reason: All initiated tasks in the session have been completed. The user clicked on the "History" link, which took them to the history page (Step 1). After that, they clicked on a specific transaction in the history list, initiating a view details task (Step 2). Then, they proceeded to click the "View Details" button, indicating completion of the view details task (Step 3). Finally, they clicked the "X" button, which is likely a common close or cancel action and does not signify abandonment of the view details page. Therefore, since all initiated tasks were completed, this session can be classified as a conversion.

   User Journey:
   1) The user clicked on the "History" link (Step 1), navigating to the history page.
   2) The user selected a specific transaction in the history list, initiating a view details task (Step 2).
   3) The user clicked the "View Details" button, indicating completion of the view details task (Step 3).
   4) The user clicked the "X" button, possibly closing or cancelling the view details page. However, since this action does not signify abandonment of the initiated tasks, it doesn't affect the conversion status of the session.
