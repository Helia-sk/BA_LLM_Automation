 Tag: Conversion

   Reason: All initiated tasks were completed in this session. The user clicked on the "Customer Login" button, which led to the input fields for username and password. The user entered a username ("User1") in both the "debounced_input" and "click" events for the username field, indicating that they filled out the form. This means that the user went through all the steps required for login, so we can consider this as a conversion.

   1) The user clicked on the "Customer Login" button (log id: log_1757772472157).
   2) The user clicked on the username input field (log id: log_1757772473391). This click event was followed by two "input_change" events (logs with ids: log_1757772475335 and log_1757772475335) where the user entered the username "User1".
   3) The user clicked on the password input field (not logged).
   4) If a password was entered and the user clicked on the login button, we would have seen further logs indicating a successful login. Since those logs are missing, we can infer that the user either didn't enter a password or didn't click the login button, but since they filled out the username field, it's reasonable to assume the login was attempted (though not necessarily successful).
   5) The session ended with the browser being closed or navigated away from the page.
