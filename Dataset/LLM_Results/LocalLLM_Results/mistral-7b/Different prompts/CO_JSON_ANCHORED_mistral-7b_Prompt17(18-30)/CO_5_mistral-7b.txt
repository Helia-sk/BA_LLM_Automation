 Tag: Conversion

   Reason: The session was a conversion as all initiated tasks were completed. The user clicked on the "Customer Login" button (indicating an intended action to log in), scrolled down to the login form, filled out the form by typing something into the input field (though we cannot confirm if it was the correct credentials), and then submitted the form.

  1) [Step 1] The user initiated a session by visiting the homepage ("http://localhost:5173/").

  2) [Step 2] The user scrolled down the page to locate the "Customer Login" button at position (598, 37).

  3) [Step 3] The user clicked on the "Customer Login" button, indicating an intended action to log in.

  4) [Step 4] The user then scrolled up to the login form, which was positioned slightly higher than where they clicked the button. They filled out the form by typing something into the input field (though we cannot confirm if it was the correct credentials).

  5) [Step 5] The user submitted the form, implying an attempt at logging in.

  6) [Step 6] The system responded to the login attempt, but we do not have information about whether the credentials were valid or not. However, since all initiated tasks were completed, this session can be considered a conversion.
