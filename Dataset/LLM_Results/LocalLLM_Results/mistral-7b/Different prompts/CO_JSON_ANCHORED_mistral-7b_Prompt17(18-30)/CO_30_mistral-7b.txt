 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: One of the initiated tasks (View Details) was not completed, indicating that the user abandoned this task.

   User Journey:
   1) [Step 1] The user navigated to the Restaurant Dashboard page ("http://localhost:5173/restaurant/dashboard") from an unknown referrer at 2025-09-27T15:20:35.792Z.
   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "History" link, navigating to the History page ("http://localhost:5173/restaurant/dashboard/history") at 2025-09-27T15:20:43.885Z.
   3) [Step 3] The user clicked on a "View Details" button, but did not complete this action. Instead, the user chose to reject or abandon this task at an unknown time.
   4) [Step 4] The user clicked on the "Reject" or "Close" button (indicated by the "Reason: User Rejected/Closed") of a popup or modal window, leaving the History page and navigating back to the Restaurant Dashboard at 2025-09-27T15:20:45.667Z.
   5) [Step 5] The user clicked on the "History" link again, but this time chose to reject or abandon the action at an unknown time.
   6) [Step 6] The user clicked on the "Reject" or "Close" button (indicated by the "Reason: User Rejected/Closed") of a popup or modal window, leaving the Restaurant Dashboard page and ending the session at 2025-09-27T15:20:43.885Z.

   It is important to note that while the user initiated multiple tasks (navigating to History, clicking "View Details", navigating back to Dashboard), they did not complete all of them, resulting in a drop-off. The user did not return to the session after abandoning the "View Details" task.
