 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: While the user initiated several tasks such as clicking on elements like "ImageDrag image here or click to upload", "Menu", and navigating through various sections of the page, the user didn't complete any tasks that could be considered a conversion (e.g., submitting a form, adding an item to the cart, etc.). The fact that the user clicked on the "Upload" section but didn't follow up indicates that they may have decided not to proceed with the intended action.

   User Journey:
   1) [Step 1] The user landed on the restaurant dashboard page (as indicated by the first log).
   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "ImageDrag image here or click to upload" section, suggesting they might have intended to add an item to the menu.
   3) [Step 3] The user navigated to the "Menu" tab, possibly to view or manage menu items.
   4) [Step 4] The user clicked on the "svg" element, which could be a back button or navigation control, indicating they might have chosen to navigate away from the current page.
   This sequence shows that while the user was exploring the application and interacting with various elements, they didn't complete any tasks that would signify a conversion. Therefore, we can classify this session as a drop-off.
