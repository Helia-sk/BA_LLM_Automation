 Tag: Drop-Off

   Reason: The user initiated the task of adding an item to the menu by clicking on the "Add Item" button, but there is no log indicating that they successfully completed this task. Instead, the user clicked on other parts of the page (such as the "Saladmixvery healthy" and "Super Minti" items) without taking further actions towards completing the task of adding an item.

   1) [Step 1] The user accessed the restaurant's menu dashboard at "http://localhost:5173/restaurant/dashboard/menu".

   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "Add Item" button to initiate the task of adding a new item to the menu.

   3) [Step 3] The user navigated through different items on the page, clicking on "Saladmixvery healthy" and "Super Minti", but did not take any further actions towards completing the "Add Item" task.

   Note: It is important to consider all logs in the session before making a decision. In this case, the user did not complete the initiated task of adding an item, so the session should be classified as a drop-off.
