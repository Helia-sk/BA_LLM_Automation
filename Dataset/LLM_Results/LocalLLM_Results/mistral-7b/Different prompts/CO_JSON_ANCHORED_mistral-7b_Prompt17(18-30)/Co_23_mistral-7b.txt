 Tag: Conversion
   Reason: The user initiated the task by clicking on "Settings" and then interacted with the "Add" button. After that, the user clicked on an input field and a search field, which are typically associated with tasks such as entering data or searching for something. However, since there are no logs indicating that the user abandoned any of these tasks, we can assume that they completed them. Finally, the user clicked on two more elements, one labeled "Add" and another labeled "Save", before leaving the session. Since all initiated tasks were completed, this session is classified as a conversion.
