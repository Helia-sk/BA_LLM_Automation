 Tag: Drop-Off

   Reason: The user journey started with a click on the "Customer Login" link, indicating an initiated task. However, after this, we see that the user clicked on the username input field and then on the password input field without entering any text, which suggests they might have intended to log in but didn't complete the process. Later, we see a click event on the form containing "UsernamePasswordSign In", suggesting the user might have intended to submit the form, but no subsequent events indicate form submission or successful login, indicating an abandoned task.

   1) User initiated the session by clicking on the "Customer Login" link.
   2) User clicked on the username input field.
   3) User clicked on the password input field.
   4) User clicked on the "UsernamePasswordSign In" form without entering any username or password, suggesting an intended action that was not completed.
   I have considered all the logs to the end as they provide sufficient information to make a decision based on the conditions specified.
