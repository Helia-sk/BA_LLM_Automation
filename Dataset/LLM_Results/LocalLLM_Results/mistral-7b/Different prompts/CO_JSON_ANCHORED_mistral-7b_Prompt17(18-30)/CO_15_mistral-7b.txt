 Tag: Conversion
   Reason: The user initiated a click on the "Customer Login" button, which was followed by a click event on the username input field and a click event on the password input field. These actions indicate that the user is attempting to login, which is a conversion event. Subsequently, the user typed in their credentials and clicked the submit button, indicating completion of the login process.
