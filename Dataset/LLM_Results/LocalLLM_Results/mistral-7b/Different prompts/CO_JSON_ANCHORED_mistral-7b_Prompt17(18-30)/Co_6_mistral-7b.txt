 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The initiated task of filling out a form (sign in) was not completed, indicating that the user did not proceed with the intended action. However, this decision is based on the information provided and if additional context or logs are available, the classification may change.

   User Journey:
   1) [Step 1] The user clicked on the "Customer Login" link, initiating the sign-in process.
   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "Username" input field to start typing their username.
   3) [Step 3] The user clicked on the "Password" input field to start typing their password.
   4) [Step 4] The user clicked outside of the form, which suggests that they may have intended to submit the form but did not complete the action.
   Since the intended action (form submission) was not completed, the session is classified as a drop-off.
