The user navigated to the login page (first click event), filled out their username (second input change event), clicked on the password field (third click event, but not considered as an initiated task since it's a required interaction to fill out the form), entered their password (fourth input change event), and finally clicked the submit button (fifth click event).

   2) [Step 2] The user filled out their username in the provided field.

   3) [Step 3] The user clicked on the password field, but it was not an initiated task since it's a required interaction to fill out the form.
