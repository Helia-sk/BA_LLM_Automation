 Tag: Drop-Off

   Reason: Although the user initially started a session by visiting "/customer/dashboard", they did not complete any tasks initiated during that session. The user scrolled through the page, but there is no evidence of any form submission, button clicks indicating an action taken, or navigation to another page within the application. The last logged event was a scroll event on the dashboard, which suggests that the user might have left the application without taking any further actions.

   1) [Step 1] User visited the dashboard page ("/customer/dashboard")
   2) [Step 2] User scrolled through the dashboard page (scroll events logged)
   3) No further actions or tasks were completed, and no navigation to another page within the application was observed.
   The user ultimately dropped off without taking any action that would indicate a conversion.
