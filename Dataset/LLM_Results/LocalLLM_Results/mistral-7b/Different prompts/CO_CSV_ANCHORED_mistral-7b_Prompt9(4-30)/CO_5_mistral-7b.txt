 Tag: Drop-Off

1. The user navigated to the homepage (log_1757773013317_qjhw9th5q) and scrolled down.
2. The user clicked on the "Customer Login" button (log_1757773015075_4wi4zz4v7), which initiated a session for customer login.
3. The user scrolled to the customer login form (not shown in logs) and started typing their username (not shown in logs).
4. The user did not complete the process by filling out the password field or submitting the form, implying they abandoned the task (not shown in logs).
5. The user then scrolled back up the page (log_1757773012670_mp8atqp66) and navigated away from the customer login page (not shown in logs), effectively ending the session.

The reason for classifying this as a drop-off is that all initiated tasks were abandoned without completion. The user started the customer login process but did not finish it, indicating they left the site or application without completing their intended action.
