1. The user (anonymous) started the session by navigating to the restaurant dashboard page (page_view event).
2. The user clicked on the "History" link, indicating an intention to view the order history (click event).
3. The user clicked on the "View Details" button for one of the orders in the history, signifying the intent to see more details about the order (click event).
4. However, after clicking on the "View Details" button, there is no subsequent event indicating that the user actually viewed the order details. Instead, the user closed the browser or navigated away from the page, as indicated by the absence of any further interaction events.
5. Since the initiated task (viewing order details) was abandoned without completion, this session can be classified as a drop-off.
