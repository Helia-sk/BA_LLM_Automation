 Tag: Drop-Off

1. The user first navigated to the homepage (/customer/dashboard) and clicked on "Restaurants". This is a step towards initiating a task, as exploring restaurants can be considered a task in this context.

2. The user then navigated to the restaurants page (/customer/dashboard/restaurant). This indicates a continuation of the previous step, where the user is further investigating the restaurants available.

3. The user scrolled through the list of restaurants on the restaurants page and clicked on one restaurant's link (/customer/dashboard/restaurant/9), indicating an interest in that particular restaurant. This could be considered a sub-task within the larger "exploring restaurants" task.

4. The user scrolled again on the selected restaurant's page, but did not interact with any other elements such as clicking on the image or the "Add to Cart" button. Since no further actions were taken towards completing this sub-task (viewing the restaurant), it remains incomplete.

5. The user then scrolled back up and left the page (/customer/dashboard/restaurant/9) by clicking on the "Restaurants" link, indicating they are returning to the previous step of browsing restaurants. This suggests that the user has abandoned the restaurant exploration task for now.

6. The user navigated away from the restaurants page (/customer/dashboard/restaurant) and returned to the homepage (/customer/dashboard). Since no further actions were taken, it can be inferred that the user has left the site without completing any other tasks, such as adding a restaurant to their cart or making a purchase.

As all initiated tasks (exploring a specific restaurant and potentially adding it to the cart) were abandoned, this session is classified as a drop-off. The user appeared interested in exploring restaurants but did not complete the task of adding one to their cart or making a purchase, suggesting they may have been browsing casually or found the process difficult or time-consuming.
