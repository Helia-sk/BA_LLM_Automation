 Tag: Drop-Off

1. The user (anonymous) navigated to the dashboard page (/customer/dashboard).
2. The user clicked on the "Orders" link, indicating an interest in viewing their orders.
3. The user clicked on an order, which suggests they wanted to view more details about it. However, they did not click on the "View Details" button to actually view the order details, suggesting they abandoned this task.
4. The user clicked on the "Balance" link, indicating another interest - checking their balance. But again, we don't have evidence that they completed any action related to viewing or modifying their balance, so it appears they abandoned this task as well.
5. The user scrolled and interacted with various elements on the page, suggesting exploration or navigation, but ultimately did not complete any tasks fully.
6. The session ended without a conversion (completion of any initiated task).
