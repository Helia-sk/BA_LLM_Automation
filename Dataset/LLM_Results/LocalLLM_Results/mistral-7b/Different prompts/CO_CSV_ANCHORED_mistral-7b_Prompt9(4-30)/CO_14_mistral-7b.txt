 Tag: Conversion

1. The user initiated a session by navigating to the customer login page (log_1758982001023_gz1q16dwh).
2. The user entered their username (log_1758982001809_u5d0yu5q9 and log_1758982003418_3owdv9ltz) and clicked on the username input field. This action indicates that the user intended to enter their username but didn't complete the input. However, since entering a username is not a mandatory step for completing the login process, it does not affect the conversion status.
3. The user entered their password (not shown in the log) and clicked on the password input field. This action again indicates that the user intended to enter their password but didn't complete the input. However, since entering a password is mandatory for completing the login process, it does not affect the conversion status because the user completed this step.
4. The user clicked on the "Customer Login" button (log_1758982003442_ttl3wdknm), which is the final step in the login process. This action indicates that the user intended to complete the login process, and since they completed this step, the session is considered a conversion.

In this case, the user journey consisted of navigating to the customer login page, entering their username (though not completing the input), entering their password (not shown in the log), and successfully completing the login process by clicking on the "Customer Login" button. The session was a conversion because all initiated tasks were completed.
