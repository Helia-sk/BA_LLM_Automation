 Tag: Mixed Session

1. The user navigated to the customer login page (log_1757772635942_8b03evpom).
2. The user clicked on the "Customer Login" button (log_1757772635942_8b03evpom), indicating an initiated task.
3. The user then entered their username (log_1757772641131_txuz0gaml and log_1757772640076_ko6uzo7bv). However, the username input event does not indicate a fully completed task, as it is unclear whether the user successfully logged in or abandoned the process.
4. The user clicked on the "Already have an account? Sign in" link (log_1757772640076_ko6uzo7bv), which could be considered another initiated task but is also unclear whether it was completed or abandoned.
5. The user clicked on the username input field (log_1757772641131_txuz0gaml), which suggests some interaction with the page after clicking the "Already have an account? Sign in" link, but again, it's unclear whether this was a completed or abandoned task.

Since it is not clear if all initiated tasks were fully completed, we classify this session as mixed. The user journey involved navigating to the customer login page and initiating tasks such as entering their username and clicking on the "Already have an account? Sign in" link, but the final outcome of those actions remains uncertain.
