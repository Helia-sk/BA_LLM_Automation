 Tag: Drop-Off

1. The user visited the customer login page (log_1757772472157_i2mznptqp) by clicking on the "Customer Login" link.
2. The user clicked on the username input field (log_1757772473391_o1b6b8hlb), indicating they intended to enter their username.
3. The user entered a username ("User1") in the username input field (log_1757772475335_8x72t0r7f, log_1757772476229_7mhpx5mvf).
4. The user clicked on the password input field (log_1757772475392_z8jyvwg2x), but no entry was made, suggesting they did not intend to enter a password.
5. The user clicked on the username input field again (log_1757772476608_fkd8g1i0b), which might indicate uncertainty or hesitation.
6. Finally, the user left the page by clicking on another link or closing the browser tab (no specific log entry for this action).

The session was not a conversion because the user did not fully complete the login process by entering their password. Instead, they dropped off after initiating the username input and expressing some hesitation about proceeding with the password input.
