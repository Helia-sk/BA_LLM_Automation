==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off

The session was not a conversion because one of the initiated tasks (username input) was abandoned, but none of them were fully completed. This is evident from the sequence of logs showing clicks on the "Customer Login" button and username input fields, followed by no further activity related to password input or form submission.

User Journey:
1. Step 1: The user navigated to the customer login page (log_1757773371689_3ak46jhcx).
2. Step 2: The user clicked on the "Customer Login" button (log_1757773372596_2oj0c59xu).
3. Step 3: The user clicked on the username input field (log_1757773373072_scoku9tbi).
4. Step 4: The user entered something into the username input field (two logs with event time 1757773371689_cf0fm6vzs and 1757773373072_l45tbs735, but no password input or form submission followed).
5. [Step X]: The user left the page without completing the login process (no further activity after step 4).
