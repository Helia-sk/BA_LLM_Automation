 Tag: Conversion

The user initiated the task of logging into the Restaurant (as indicated by clicking the "Restaurant Login" link). The user then proceeded to enter their username ("User1") and password (not provided in the log file) in the respective input fields. After entering their username, the user clicked on both the "username" input field and the "password" input field, which suggests that they were attempting to fill out these fields. This indicates that the user intended to complete the login process. Since the password was not provided in the log file, we cannot confirm if the user successfully logged in or not. However, since the user interacted with both the username and password fields, it is reasonable to assume that they were attempting to complete the login task. As such, the session can be classified as a conversion because the user initiated and intended to complete the login process.

1. The user navigated to the Restaurant login page (indicated by clicking the "Restaurant Login" link).
2. The user entered their username ("User1") in the username input field.
3. The user clicked on the password input field, indicating that they intended to enter their password.
4. (Assumption) The user entered their password in the password input field and submitted the form.
5. (Assumption) Upon successful login, the user would be taken to a different page or perform other actions specific to a logged-in user, but this is not shown in the log file provided.
