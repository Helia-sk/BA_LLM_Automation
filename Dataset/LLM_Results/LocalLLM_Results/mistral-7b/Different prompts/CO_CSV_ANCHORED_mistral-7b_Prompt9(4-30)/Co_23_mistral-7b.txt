 Tag: Drop-Off

1. The user navigated to the page at "/restaurant/dashboard/settings" (log_1758985242334_sdckpcitq).
2. Clicked on the "Settings" link (log_1758985242334_sdckpcitq).
3. Clicked on a "Div" element with text "Add" (log_1758985244978_iwp6mwb31), presumably intending to add something, but did not complete the action.
4. Clicked on an input field, presumably intending to enter some data, but did not do so before leaving the page (log_1758985245310_oskul68ek).
5. The user left the page without completing any initiated tasks, indicating a drop-off session.

Reason: The user initiated tasks but did not complete them, suggesting that they left the page prematurely or had issues with the interface, leading to an incomplete interaction and ultimately a drop-off session.
