1. The user initiated a session by visiting the login page (log_1758985849032_pt9psc4kp).
2. The user entered their credentials on the login form (log_1758985849134_sm9gb6j5r, log_1758985849132_pt9psc4kp) but did not submit the form.
3. The user clicked on the "History" link to navigate to the history page (log_1758985849134_vaj1bttsz).
4. The user navigated back to the login page, presumably to re-enter their credentials (log_1758985849032_pt9psc4kp) but did not submit again.
5. The session ended without any further interaction from the user.

Reason: The user initiated a login attempt and navigated to the history page, but they did not complete the login or perform any other actions on the history page, indicating that the session was abandoned (drop-off).
