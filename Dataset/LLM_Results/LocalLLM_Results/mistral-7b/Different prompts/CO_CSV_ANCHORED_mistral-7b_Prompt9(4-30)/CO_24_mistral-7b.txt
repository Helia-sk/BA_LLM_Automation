 Tag: Drop-Off

1. The user navigated to the restaurant's dashboard menu page (`/restaurant/dashboard/menu`) at 2025-09-27T15:02:07.601Z. This could be considered the start of the session.
2. The user clicked on the "Menu" link, which led to the image drag and drop area for uploading menu items (at 2025-09-27T15:02:10.432Z). This could be considered an initiated task.
3. The user then clicked on the SVG element within the image drag and drop area at 2025-09-27T15:02:10.432Z, which suggests an attempt to interact with the upload functionality. However, there is no subsequent log entry indicating a successful file upload or completion of any other tasks within the menu creation process.
4. The user clicked on various elements within the form (at 2025-09-27T15:02:11.764Z, 2025-09-27T15:02:12.053Z), but there is no indication that they completed any task related to menu item creation or submission.
5. The user clicked on the "svg" element again at 2025-09-27T15:02:33 (log not provided, but it's within the session time frame), which suggests further interaction with the image drag and drop area without any clear indication of task completion.
6. The user left the page (presumably abandoning their session) at 2025-09-27T15:03:21.083Z, as there are no further log entries within the session time frame.

Since all initiated tasks were abandoned without completion, this session is classified as a drop-off. The user started to create or manage menu items but did not complete the process.
