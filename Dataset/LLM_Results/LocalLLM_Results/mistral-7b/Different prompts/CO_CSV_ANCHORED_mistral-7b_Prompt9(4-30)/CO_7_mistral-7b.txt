1. The user (anonymous) visits the customer login page ("/customer/login").
2. The user clicks on the "Customer Login" button, indicating an initiated task of logging in.
3. After clicking the "Customer Login" button, the user navigates to the username input field and clicks it. This is likely an attempt to enter a username for login. However, there is no further interaction recorded from this point onwards, such as entering a password or submitting the login form.
4. The user then navigates away from the username input field without completing any subsequent steps, indicating that they may have abandoned the login process.
5. No other interactions are recorded after this, suggesting that the session was dropped off.
