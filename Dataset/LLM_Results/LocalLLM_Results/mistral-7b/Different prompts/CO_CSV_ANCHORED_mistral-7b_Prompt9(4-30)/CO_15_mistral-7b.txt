==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off

1. The user navigates to the homepage (log_1758982282530_ew7a529gr). This is considered an initiated task as it signifies the start of a user journey.

2. The user clicks on the "Customer Login" button, which takes them to the customer login page (log_1758982299417_vimywuxpt). This is another step in the user journey as they are taking action towards completing a goal.

3. The user clicks on the username input field (log_1758982300242_lmwx4qaau) and then types one character ("U") into the field (log_1758982302837_uugm0ut74). This indicates that they are attempting to enter their username.

4. The user clicks on the password input field but does not type anything in it (this action is not logged, but we can infer from the subsequent steps that the user did not enter a password).

5. The user clicks on the password input field again (log_1758982304628_qi3zxjc0s), then clicks away from the password input field without entering any text (log_1758982306701_m5hxr1o9g). This suggests that the user is having trouble with the password input.

6. The user clicks on the password input field again (log_1758982308146_xu1wz4yhr), but they do not enter any text before clicking away from the field (log_1758982310010_e8nq2j83g). This indicates further struggle with the password input.

7. The user clicks on the username input field again (log_1758982312174_b0yx6s40v), then clicks away from the field without entering any additional characters (log_1758982314325_j0o0u4p3h). This suggests that they are not able to complete their username entry.

8. The user clicks on the password input field one last time (log_1758982316516_b2ywg2s6d), but again, they do not enter any text before clicking away from the field (log_1758982318504_rkx2wzp9i). At this point, it appears that the user has given up on trying to log in.

Since the user initiated a login process but did not complete it, this session can be classified as a drop-off. The user struggled with both the username and password input fields, which may indicate issues with the user interface or potential usability problems. To improve the user experience, it would be beneficial to investigate these issues and make necessary adjustments to the login process.
