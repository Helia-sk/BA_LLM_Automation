 Tag: Drop-Off

1. The user (User1) initiates a session by navigating to the page "/" at 2025-09-27T14:48:08.691Z. This is the beginning of the session.
2. The user clicks on a link ("Restaurant PartnersRegister your restaurant or log in to manage orders") at 2025-09-27T14:48:12.967Z, which takes them to the login/register page for restaurants ("/restaurant/login"). This is the first initiated task.
3. User1 clicks on the "username" input field at 2025-09-27T14:48:13.682Z, indicating they want to enter their username. However, this is where the session ends, and no further actions are recorded in the log file.
4. User1 does not complete any other tasks initiated during the session, such as entering a password or clicking the login button. Since all initiated tasks were abandoned, the session is classified as a drop-off.

The user journey step-by-step can be summarized as follows:

1. The user navigates to the homepage of the application ("/").
2. The user clicks on a link to the restaurant login/registration page ("/restaurant/login").
3. The user interacts with the "username" input field, indicating they want to enter their username.
