 Tag: Drop-Off

1. The user clicked on the link to visit the Restaurant Partners page (log_1758985133183_ivi9skey6).
2. The user clicked on the "Register your restaurant or log in to manage orders" link (log_1758985133183_ivi9skey6) and navigated to the login page (/restaurant/login).
3. The user clicked on the username input field (log_1758985133860_n2e4t50oy), indicating an attempt to enter their username.
4. The user clicked on the password input field (log_1758985133860_n2e4t50oy), indicating an attempt to enter their password.
5. The user entered a username ("User1", log_1758985135389_dptsgwwpt) and a password field was not found in the logs, which suggests that the user did not complete the login process, thus abandoning the task.
6. The user clicked on the username input field again (log_1758985135389_dptsgwwpt), possibly attempting to correct their username or re-enter it.
7. The user clicked on the password input field again (log_1758985135389_dptsgwwpt), indicating a continued attempt to enter their password, but no further actions were recorded in the logs, suggesting that the user abandoned the task.

The session was dropped off because the user initiated the login process but did not complete it before leaving the application without any other interaction or conversion events.
