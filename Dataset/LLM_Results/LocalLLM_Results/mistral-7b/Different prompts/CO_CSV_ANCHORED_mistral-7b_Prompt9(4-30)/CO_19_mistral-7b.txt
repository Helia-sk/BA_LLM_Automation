If all initiated tasks are completed → Tag: Conversion. If all initiated tasks are abandoned → Tag: Drop-Off. Provide a reason for your classification. Then, outline the user journey step-by-step.Format your response as follows:
Tag: Conversion || Drop-Off ||  [Reason].

 Tag: Drop-Off

1. The user navigates to the homepage from a restaurant dashboard settings page (log_1758982735683_nn4i1w1qb). This indicates that the user is already logged in and possibly active on the restaurant dashboard.

2. The user clicks on the "Customer Login" button (log_1758982745841_zt9tbfo0t), which leads to the customer login page (/customer/login). This suggests that the user might have mistakenly clicked on the Customer Login button instead of continuing with the restaurant dashboard.

3. The user clicks on the username input field on the customer login page (log_1758982746939_7qttgtuwg), which is typically the first step in the login process. However, no further actions related to filling in the username or password are observed.

4. The user clicks on the username input field again (log_1758982745841_zt9tbfo0t), which implies that they might have intended to fill in their username but did not complete the process.

5. No further actions related to completing the login process or navigating elsewhere on the site are observed, suggesting that the user abandoned the session (log entries after this point do not show any completed tasks).

The reason for classifying this as a drop-off is that while the user initiated a task (logging in), they did not complete it. They only clicked on the username input field twice without filling in their credentials or proceeding with the login process.
