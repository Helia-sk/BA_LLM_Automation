 Tag: Drop-Off

1. The user initiated a session by navigating to the restaurant login page (log_1757772897799_nqzze9f9t).
2. The user clicked on the "Restaurant Login" button (log_1757772897799_oyux16s7v), which would typically trigger a login form to appear, but in this case, it appears that the login form was not shown or the user did not interact with it further.
3. The user clicked on a link labeled "Already have an account? Sign in" (log_1757772899548_77h99t01p), which could be interpreted as an intention to create an account or return to the login page, but no further actions related to account creation or login were recorded.
4. The user clicked on an input field for the username (log_1757772900702_fnh4c2rlu), which is likely a step in the login process, but they did not enter any text and then left the page or closed the browser without any further interaction.

Since the user initiated actions on the page (logging in or signing up) but did not complete them, this session can be classified as a drop-off. The reason for this classification is that all initiated tasks were abandoned without completion.
