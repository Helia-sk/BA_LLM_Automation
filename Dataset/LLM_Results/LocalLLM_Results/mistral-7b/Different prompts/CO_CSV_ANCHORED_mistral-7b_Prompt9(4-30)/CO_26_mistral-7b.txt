If all initiated tasks are completed → Tag: Conversion. If all initiated tasks are abandoned → Tag: Drop-Off. Provide a reason for your classification. Then, outline the user journey step-by-step.Format your response as follows:

 Tag: Drop-Off

1. The user initiated a session by navigating to the restaurant menu page (`/restaurant/dashboard/menu`) at `2025-09-27T15:06:33.634Z`.
2. The user clicked on an item listing ("Drag image here or click to upload") under "Starters" section, indicating a potential intention to add an item to the menu (`log_1758985593634_wnpmodruc`).
3. The user then clicked on another item listing ("Saladmixvery healthy€0.08") under "Starters" section, suggesting further exploration of the menu items (`log_1758985597527_w11zz2b0e`).
4. The user clicked on an image icon next to the item listing, which might have been intended to upload an image for the menu item (`log_1758985597816_qudvz81oz`). However, no log indicates a successful upload of an image, implying that this action was abandoned.
5. The user clicked on another button labeled "Add Item" in the bottom right corner (`log_1758985597816_qudvz81oz`). This could have been intended to add the selected item(s) to the menu, but no log suggests that this action was completed successfully.
6. The user clicked on an SVG element (possibly a back or home button), indicating they might have navigated away from the menu page (`log_1758985593634_wnpmodruc`).

Since all initiated tasks were abandoned, this session can be classified as a drop-off. The user did not fully complete any of the tasks they started (adding items to the menu or uploading images), so no conversion occurred in this instance.
