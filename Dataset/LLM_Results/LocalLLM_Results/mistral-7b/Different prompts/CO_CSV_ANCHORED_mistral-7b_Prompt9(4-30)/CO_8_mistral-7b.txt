 Tag: Drop-Off

1. The user navigated to the customer login page (log_1757773780414_4g211r8g2).
2. The user clicked on the "Username" field, indicating they intended to enter their username (log_1757773797385_uwv7j47ib).
3. The user clicked on the "Username" field again, possibly to start typing their username (log_1757773797833_std7mojhy).
4. The user clicked on the "Username" field a third time, suggesting they may have been trying to enter or correct something (log_1757773797385_uwv7j47ib again).
5. The user clicked on the username input field for a fourth time (log_1757773797833_std7mojhy again).
6. The user did not proceed to enter their password or click the login button, indicating they abandoned the process (no subsequent logs indicate the user completed steps 7 and 8).

Reason: The session was a drop-off because the user initiated the login process but did not complete it by entering both their username and password and clicking the login button.
