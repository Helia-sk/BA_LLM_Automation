==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The session did not result in a clear conversion as the user did not perform any action that typically indicates a successful transaction or goal completion, such as adding an item to the cart or completing a form. Instead, the user navigated through the menu and clicked on the "Menu" link.

1) [Step 1] The user started a new session by accessing the restaurant's dashboard page (/restaurant/dashboard).
2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "Menu" link to navigate to the menu page (/restaurant/dashboard/menu).
3) [Step 3] The user browsed through the menu items.
4) [Step 4] The user clicked on the "Add Item" button, indicating an intention to add a new item. However, it is not confirmed whether the user successfully added an item or not, as no subsequent actions suggesting a successful addition or a transaction were recorded in this session.
5) [Step 5] The user did not take any further action that would typically indicate a conversion, such as clicking on the "Cart" link or completing a form.
6) [Step 6] The user ended the session without taking actions that would suggest a successful transaction or goal completion.
