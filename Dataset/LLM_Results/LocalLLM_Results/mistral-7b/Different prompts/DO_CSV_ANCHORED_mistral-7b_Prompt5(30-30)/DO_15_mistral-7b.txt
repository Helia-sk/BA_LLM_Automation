==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The session does not show the user completing a successful registration or login, which are typical goals for a login page. Instead, it appears that the user navigated away from the login page after clicking on the "Restaurant Partners" link.

1) [Step 1] User navigates to the restaurant login page (/restaurant/login).
2) [Step 2] The user clicks on the "Restaurant Partners" link located below the login form.
3) [Step 3] User is redirected to another page (presumably the Restaurant Partners registration or landing page), but no further interaction with the login form is observed in the log data provided.
4) [Step 4] The session ends, as there is no evidence of a subsequent return to the login form or any other action that would indicate a successful login or registration.
