 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The session shows the user navigating to the homepage, scrolling down slightly, and then clicking on a link to go to the "/customer/login" page. However, there is no subsequent interaction or event indicating that the user logged in or performed any other action that would constitute a conversion. Instead, the user appears to have simply left the site after this initial click.

  1) [Step 1] User opens a new browser tab and navigates to the homepage of the website (http://localhost:5173/).
  2) [Step 2] The user scrolls down the page slightly, but does not interact with any elements on the homepage.
  3) [Step 3] User clicks on a link that takes them to the "/customer/login" page (http://localhost:5173/customer/login).
  4) [Step 4] After reaching the login page, there is no further interaction or event recorded in the session, indicating that the user did not log in or perform any other action. The session ends.
