==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The session ended without a clear indication of a completed action, such as logging in or making a purchase.
   1) [Step 1] User navigated to the "/restaurant/login" page.
   2) [Step 2] User clicked on the "username" input field.
   3) [Step 3] User entered "User1" as their username and moved focus away from the field (indicating a change or submission of the username).
   4) [Step 4] User clicked on the "password" input field but did not enter any password before moving away from the field.
   5) [Step 5] User clicked on the "username" input field again, indicating they may have wanted to correct their username entry or start over.
   6) [Step 6] User clicked on the "Restaurant Partners" text, but this action does not seem to be part of a typical login process, so it is unclear what the user intended to do after this point.
   7) [Step 7] The session ended without any further interaction, suggesting that the user did not complete a conversion (e.g., logging in or making a purchase).
