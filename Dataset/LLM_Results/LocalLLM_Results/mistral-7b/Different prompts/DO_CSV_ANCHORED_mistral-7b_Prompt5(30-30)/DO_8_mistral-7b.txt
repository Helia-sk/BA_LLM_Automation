==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The session does not end with a clear conversion event, such as a successful login or purchase. Instead, it appears that the user interacted with various elements of the page but did not complete any goal or action that could be considered a conversion.

1) [Step 1] User navigates to the customer login page (indicated by clicking on "Customer Login" link).
2) [Step 2] User clicks on the username input field and potentially enters their username (evidenced by the "input_change" events). However, we don't have enough information to confirm whether a valid username was entered.
3) [Step 3] User clicks on the password input field, but no "input_change" event is logged for it, indicating that they may not have entered their password.
4) [Step 4] User clicks on the username input field again (indicating potential uncertainty or error).
5) [Step 5] User clicks on the password input field once more but no "input_change" event is logged for it again, suggesting that they might not have entered their password.
6) [Step 6] User clicks outside of the username and password fields (indicating that they may have decided to leave or navigate away from the page without completing the login process).
