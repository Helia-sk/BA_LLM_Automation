Prompt: Determine if the session was a drop-off or a conversion. Provide a reason for your classification. Then, outline the user journey step-by-step. Format your response as follows: Tag: Conversion||Drop-Off  [Reason]. 1) [Step 1] 2) [Step 2] 3) [Step 3] …
==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The session did not result in a conversion because there is no event indicating a successful completion of the intended action (e.g., login or purchase). Instead, the user's interaction history shows scrolling and clicking on various links but does not include an event that signifies a completed transaction or successful login.

1) [Step 1] - The session starts with the user visiting the restaurant page at `http://localhost:5173/restaurant/login` (log_1757763609230_4tmfpch76).
2) [Step 2] - The user clicks on the "Restaurant Login" button (click event, log_1757763609230_koft1232g).
3) [Step 3] - The user scrolls down the page (scroll event, log_1757763606219_c2hwfdkf3).
4) [Step 4] - The user continues to scroll up and down the page with y-coordinate values changing (scroll events, log_1757763605641_ciefxrzrw).
5) [Step 5] - The session ends without any further interaction that indicates a successful login or transition to another significant page.
