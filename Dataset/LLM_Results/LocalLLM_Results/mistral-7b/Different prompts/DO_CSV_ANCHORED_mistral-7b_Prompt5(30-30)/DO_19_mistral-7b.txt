==================================================

 Tag: Drop-off
   Reason: The session includes user interactions such as clicking the "Register your restaurant or log in to manage orders" link, but there is no subsequent interaction that indicates a successful login or registration. This lack of further interaction suggests that the user did not complete their intended action and left the site without logging in or registering.

1) [Step 1] The user visits the Restaurant Partners page (/restaurant/login).
2) [Step 2] The user clicks on the "Register your restaurant or log in to manage orders" link. This suggests that the user is interested in either registering a new restaurant or logging in to manage an existing one.
3) [Step 3] The user interacts with the username input field by clicking on it, but no further interaction indicates entering a valid username.
4) [Step 4] The user clicks on the username input field again, suggesting that they might be trying to enter a username or correct an error, but there is no subsequent action indicating a successful login or registration attempt.
5) [Step 5] The session ends without any further interaction, indicating that the user has left the site without completing their intended action (logging in or registering).
