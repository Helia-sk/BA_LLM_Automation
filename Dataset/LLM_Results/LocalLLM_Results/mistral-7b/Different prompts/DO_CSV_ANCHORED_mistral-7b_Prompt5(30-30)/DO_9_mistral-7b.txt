 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The session ended without a page load event indicating a successful transaction or form submission, which are common indicators of a conversion.
   1) [Step 1] The user clicked on the "Customer Login" link on the homepage.
   2) [Step 2] Upon reaching the login page, the user entered a username ("User1") and clicked on the username field after entering the value.
   3) [Step 3] The user then clicked on the username field again, indicating they may have intended to enter a password but did not do so before leaving the page.
   4) [Step 4] The user did not click on any other interactable elements on the login page, and there was no subsequent activity recorded for this session.
