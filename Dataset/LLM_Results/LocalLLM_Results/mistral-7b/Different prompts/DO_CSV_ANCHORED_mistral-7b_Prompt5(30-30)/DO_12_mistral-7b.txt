==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user did not complete any actions that lead to a conversion, such as placing an order or logging in. Instead, the session shows a series of clicks and scroll events on various parts of the website, but no form submission or other definitive action towards completing a transaction or account creation.

   Step 1) The user arrived at the Lieferspatz homepage (log_1757765176256).
   Step 2) The user clicked on the Lieferspatz logo (log_1757765175789), which redirected them to the customer login page for Lieferspatz Restaurant.
   Step 3) The user clicked on the "Customer Login" section of the Lieferspatz Restaurant login page (log_1757765175427).
   Step 4) The user clicked again on the "Customer Login" section, slightly higher up on the page (log_1757765175427). This action suggests that the user might have been trying to focus on the clickable area.
   Step 5) The user scrolled down the customer login page (log_1757765182697), possibly looking for additional information or options.
   Step 6) The user clicked on a link outside of the Lieferspatz Restaurant section, taking them to the main Lieferspatz page again (log_1757765176256).
   Step 7) The user scrolled down the Lieferspatz homepage (log_1757765182697), suggesting that they were exploring the site.
   Step 8) The user clicked on the "LieferspatzRestaurant Login" section of the homepage (log_1757765175427). This action was repeated from step 3, indicating a potential confusion or error in focus.
   Step 9) The user scrolled up the page (log_1757765175789), possibly trying to get back to the part of the page they were focusing on.
   Step 10) The session ended with no further interactions from the user, suggesting that they did not find what they were looking for or decided not to proceed further.
