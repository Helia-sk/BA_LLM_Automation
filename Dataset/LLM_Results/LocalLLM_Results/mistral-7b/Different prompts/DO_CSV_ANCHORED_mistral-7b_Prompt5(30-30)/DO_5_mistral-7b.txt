==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The session shows the user navigating to the login page, interacting with the username input field (input_change.v1 and click.v1 events), but there is no event indicating a successful login or any further interaction suggesting a completed action. This lack of a conclusive action suggests that the session was dropped off without conversion.

   Step 1) The user opens the application on Chrome browser with version 140.0.0.0 on Windows 10 (log_1757763871623_ixv88ylot).
   Step 2) The user navigates to the customer login page (/customer/login) (log_1757763869188_ics4wi63d and log_1757763868140_68s8x8kgs).
   Step 3) The user enters "hi" into the username input field and clicks away from it (log_1757763869188_ics4wi63d and log_1757763868140_68s8x8kgs).
   Step 4) The user clicks on the sign-in button, but there is no subsequent event indicating a successful login or further interaction (log_1757763871708_sf7rfm74b).
   Step 5) The session ends without any additional interaction from the user.
