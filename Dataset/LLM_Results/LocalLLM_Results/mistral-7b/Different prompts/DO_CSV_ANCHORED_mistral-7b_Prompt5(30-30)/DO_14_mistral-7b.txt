==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The session did not result in a successful completion of the intended action, which in this case seems to be a login for the restaurant. Although the user interacted with various elements on the page (clicking buttons and inputting data), there is no evidence that the login was ultimately successful.

1) [Step 1] The user initiated a new session by navigating to the restaurant's login page.
2) [Step 2] The user clicked the "Restaurant Login" button, indicating an intent to start the login process.
3) [Step 3] The user then provided input for the "username" field and interacted with it twice (debounced_input events).
4) [Step 4] After that, the user provided input for the "password" field and interacted with it once (blur event).
5) [Step 5] The user then clicked the username input field again (click event), suggesting they may have intended to correct or re-enter their username. However, without further actions indicating a successful login, we can assume that the session ended as a drop-off.
