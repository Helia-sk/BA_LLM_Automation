==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The session ended without any form of interaction with the "Register your restaurant or log in to manage orders" link, which would typically lead to a conversion if the user were intending to log in or register. Instead, the user only interacted with the username and password input fields but did not submit the login credentials.

  1) [Step 1] User navigates to the restaurant partners login/registration page (/restaurant/login).
  2) [Step 2] User clicks on the username input field, indicating an intention to enter their username.
  3) [Step 3] User types "User1" into the username input field.
  4) [Step 4] User clicks on the password input field, indicating an intention to enter their password.
  5) [Step 5] User does not interact with the password input field any further or click the login button, suggesting that they did not complete the login process and instead dropped off.
