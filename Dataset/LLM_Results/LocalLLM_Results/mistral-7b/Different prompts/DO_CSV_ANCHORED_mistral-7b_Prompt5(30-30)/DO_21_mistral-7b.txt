 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user navigated to the restaurant login page, but we don't have data indicating that they successfully logged in or performed any other action that would typically lead to a conversion (such as placing an order or browsing more pages). Instead, it appears they left the site after clicking on the "Restaurant Login" button.

1) [Step 1] The user navigated to the restaurant's website by entering the URL in their browser or following a link from another source.
2) [Step 2] Upon arriving at the homepage, the user did not interact with any elements for a moment, indicating they were reviewing the content.
3) [Step 3] The user then clicked on the "Restaurant Login" button located at the top right corner of the page.
4) [Step 4] After clicking the login button, there is no subsequent activity recorded in the log, suggesting the user either decided not to log in or encountered an issue during the login process and left the site.
