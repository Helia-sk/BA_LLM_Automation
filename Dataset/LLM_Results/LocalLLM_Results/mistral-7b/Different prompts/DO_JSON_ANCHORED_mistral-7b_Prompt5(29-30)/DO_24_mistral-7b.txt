   1) [Step 1] The user navigated to the "Restaurant Partners" landing page.
   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on an input field for the username, suggesting they were about to enter their credentials, but did not actually do so.
   3) [Step 3] The user clicked on a different input field for the password, again without entering any information.
   4) [Step 4] The user clicked on the username input field again, indicating potential confusion or indecision.
   5) [Step 5] The user clicked on the "Restaurant Partners" text, suggesting they might have been trying to navigate away from the page or were simply exploring the page layout.
   6) [Step 6] The user clicked on the username input field once more before leaving the page, indicating uncertain or indecisive behavior that did not lead to a conversion.
