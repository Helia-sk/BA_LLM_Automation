Prompt: Determine if the session was a drop-off or a conversion. Provide a reason for your classification. Then, outline the user journey step-by-step. Format your response as follows: Tag: Conversion||Drop-Off  [Reason]. 1) [Step 1] 2) [Step 2] 3) [Step 3] …
==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The session ends without any form submission or action that indicates a successful conversion, such as making an order.

   1) [Step 1] The user clicks on the "Restaurant Partners" link on the homepage, indicating an initial interest in registering or logging in to manage orders.
   2) [Step 2] Upon landing on the "/restaurant/login" page, the user does not immediately attempt to log in or create a new account.
   3) [Step 3] Instead, the user clicks on the "Register your restaurant" link, possibly indicating an intent to create a new account.
   4) [Step 4] The user then clicks on the input field for the username, suggesting that they are preparing to enter their login credentials or create a new account. However, no subsequent action is recorded in our data.
   5) [Step 5] After this point, there are no further interactions or form submissions indicating a successful conversion (e.g., login, order placement). The session ends without any clear indication that the user completed their intended action. This suggests that the user may have navigated away from the site or encountered difficulties during the registration/login process, resulting in a drop-off.
