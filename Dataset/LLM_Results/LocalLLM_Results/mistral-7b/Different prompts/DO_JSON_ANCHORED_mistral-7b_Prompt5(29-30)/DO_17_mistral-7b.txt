 Tag: Drop-Off

   3) [Step 3] The user then clicked on the username input field (indicated by the click event on the input field), suggesting they intended to enter their username. However, no subsequent events indicate that they actually entered any data and proceeded with the login process.
   4) [Step 4] The user clicked on the password input field, again without entering any data or taking further action.
