   2) [Step 2] Upon reaching the login page, the user clicks on the login field (no input provided).
   3) [Step 3] The user does not provide any password or take further actions to complete the login process, and no subsequent interactions are recorded. This indicates that the session was a drop-off as the intended goal of logging in was not achieved.
