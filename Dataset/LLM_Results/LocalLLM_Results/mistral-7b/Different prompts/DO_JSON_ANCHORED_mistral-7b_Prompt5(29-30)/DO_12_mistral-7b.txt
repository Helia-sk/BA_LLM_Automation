 Tag: Drop-off
   Reason: The session did not result in a conversion (i.e., the user did not complete the intended action, which in this case seems to be logging into the customer account).

   1) [Step 1] User clicked on the "Lieferspatz" logo, indicating they arrived at the homepage of the Lieferspatz website (log_1757765176256_4eyiaebhb).
   2) [Step 2] The user then clicked on the "LieferspatzRestaurant Login" section, navigating to the customer login page (log_1757765175789_xv5si04h1 and log_1757765175427_i26y7dno1).
   3) [Step 3] The user did not provide login credentials or take any further action, indicating a drop-off in the session (no subsequent logs show any interaction related to logging in).
