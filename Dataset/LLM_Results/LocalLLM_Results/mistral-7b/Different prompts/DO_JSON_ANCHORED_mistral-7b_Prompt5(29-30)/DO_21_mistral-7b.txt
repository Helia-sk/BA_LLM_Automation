   3) [Step 3] The user clicked on an input field for the username (event_name: click).
   4) [Step 4] The user entered text into the username field, but did not submit any form or perform any other action that would indicate a successful conversion.
   5) [Step 5] The user resized the window (event_name: window_resize), but this does not contribute to a conversion.
   6) [Step 6] The user did not take any further actions on the site, indicating that they likely left the site without completing their intended goal.
