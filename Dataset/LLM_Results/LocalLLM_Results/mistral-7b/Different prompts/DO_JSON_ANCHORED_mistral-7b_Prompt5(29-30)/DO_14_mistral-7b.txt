 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user performed multiple interactions with the site, but they did not complete the intended goal (login to the restaurant). They clicked on various elements such as a link and input fields, but there is no evidence in the log that they successfully logged in or completed any other action that could be considered a conversion.

   User Journey:
   1) [Step 1] The user visited the Restaurant Login page (indicated by the click on the "Restaurant Login" link).
   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the username input field, indicating they intended to enter their username.
   3) [Step 3] The user clicked on the password input field, indicating they also intended to enter their password.
   4) [Step 4] The user interacted with the login button by clicking on it (indicated by two separate events), but there is no subsequent event that indicates a successful login or further action within the site, suggesting the user did not complete the intended goal.
   5) [Step 5] The user clicked on various other elements within the page (as indicated by multiple click events in the log), but these actions do not constitute a conversion as they did not result in a successful login or any other significant interaction within the site.
