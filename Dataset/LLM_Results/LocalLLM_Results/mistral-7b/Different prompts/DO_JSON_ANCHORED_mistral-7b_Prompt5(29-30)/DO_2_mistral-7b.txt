   Reason: The session does not show any interactions that indicate a completion of the intended goal (login for either restaurant or customer). Instead, it shows scrolling and clicking on links without further interaction.

   Step 2) The user scrolled down the page (scroll event at timestamp 2025-09-13T11:40:06.219Z).
   Step 3) The user clicked on the "Restaurant Login" link (click event at timestamp 2025-09-13T11:40:07.141Z).
   Step 4) The user scrolled down the Restaurant Login page (scroll event at timestamp 2025-09-13T11:40:07.141Z).
   Step 5) The user clicked on the "Customer Login" link (click event at timestamp 2025-09-13T11:40:07.141Z).
   Step 6) The user scrolled down the Customer Login page (scroll event at timestamp 2025-09-13T11:40:07.141Z). No further interaction was recorded, indicating a drop-off instead of a conversion.
