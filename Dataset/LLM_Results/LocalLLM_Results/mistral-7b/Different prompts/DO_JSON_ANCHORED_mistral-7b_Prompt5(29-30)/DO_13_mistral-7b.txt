==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off

Reason: The session does not seem to result in a conversion because the user did not perform any action that indicates a purchase or completion of a registration process. The user navigated through different pages, but none of the clicked links led to a checkout page or a page where registration is completed.

1) [Step 1] User landed on the homepage (/). They scrolled down to explore the content.
2) [Step 2] After scrolling, they clicked on the "Hungry? Order delicious food from local restaurants" link, which took them to the login page for customer service (/customer/login).
3) [Step 3] The user then scrolled down further on the /customer/login page. However, there is no evidence in the logs that they logged in or performed any actions that would indicate a successful login.
4) [Step 4] They scrolled again on the same page (/customer/login), but there are no subsequent actions indicating interaction with other pages or completion of any task.
5) [Step 5] The user left the application by navigating away from the page, possibly due to lack of engagement or finding what they were looking for.
