==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The session shows the user navigating to the Restaurant Login page, clicking on it, and then proceeding to interact with the username input field. However, there is no evidence of a successful login or any subsequent interaction that would indicate a conversion (e.g., placing an order, viewing menu items, etc.). The last interaction recorded was with the password input field, but there's no data suggesting a password was entered and the login process was completed.

   Step 1: [The user navigated to the Restaurant Login page]
   2) [The user clicked on the "Restaurant Login" link]
   3) [The user interacted with the username input field (without entering any data)]
   4) [The user attempted to interact with the password input field, but there's no data suggesting a password was entered or login successful]
