==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The session ended without a clear conversion action such as form submission or product purchase.

   1) [Step 1] User opened the webpage at "http://localhost:5173/customer/login". This could be considered the start of the user journey, where the user navigated to the customer login page.
   2) [Step 2] User clicked the "Customer Login" button located at x = 597, y = 47 on the webpage. This action indicated that the user intended to log in to the website.
   3) [Step 3] The user then clicked an input field for username, but did not enter any text or perform any other action related to the login process.
   4) [Step 4] The user clicked the same username input field again, suggesting that they might have intended to correct or update their username, but no further actions were taken.
   5) [Step 5] The user then clicked a different input field for password, but did not enter any text or perform any other action related to the login process.
   6) [Step 6] The user clicked the same password input field again, suggesting that they might have intended to correct or update their password, but no further actions were taken.
   7) [Step 7] The user clicked an input field for username once more, indicating potential confusion or uncertainty about entering their username and/or password.
   8) [Step 8] The user clicked a different part of the webpage (x = 386, y = 301), possibly due to frustration or lack of clarity in the login process.
   9) [Step 9] The user then clicked an input field for username one final time, but again did not enter any text or perform any other action related to the login process.
   After this series of actions without a successful login attempt or further interaction with other parts of the website, it appears that the user dropped off and did not complete a conversion action.
