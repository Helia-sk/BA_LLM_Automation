 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The session started with a page view (log_1757766497602), followed by clicking on the "Restaurant Login" link (log_1757766513269_1j1sua7jb) and then navigating to the login page (log_1757766514090_yohkq9n2q). However, no further interactions were recorded after that, indicating that the user did not complete the login process or take any other actions on the site, which suggests a drop-off.
