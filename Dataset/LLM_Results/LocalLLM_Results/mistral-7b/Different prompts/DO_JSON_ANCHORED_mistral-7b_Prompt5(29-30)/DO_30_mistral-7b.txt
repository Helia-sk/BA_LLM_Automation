==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The session started on the dashboard page, the user clicked "Menu" to navigate to the menu page, then clicked "Add Item", but there's no subsequent interaction or navigation suggesting a successful addition of an item. The final interaction was clicking "Accept" on the dashboard page, which seems inconclusive for a conversion.

   Step 1) The user started the session on the restaurant dashboard page.

   Step 2) The user navigated to the menu page by clicking the "Menu" link.

   Step 3) On the menu page, the user clicked the "Add Item" button, but no further interaction or navigation was recorded to suggest a successful addition of an item.

   Step 4) The user returned to the dashboard page and clicked "Accept". However, this action is not directly related to the initial navigation to the menu page and does not indicate a conversion, as there's no evidence that an item was successfully added.
