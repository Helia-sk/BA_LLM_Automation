 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The session did not result in a successful login or any further actions that would indicate a completed transaction or goal achievement.

   1) [Step 1] User navigated to the restaurant partners page (http://localhost:5173/restaurant/login). This could be interpreted as an initial interest in interacting with the website.
   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "Register your restaurant or log in to manage orders" link, indicating an intention to either register a new restaurant or log in to an existing account.
   3) [Step 3] The user then clicked on the login button, which brought them to the login form. However, no further interactions were recorded suggesting that the user did not complete the login process.
   4) [Step 4] The user clicked on the username field, but no subsequent actions were taken, suggesting they may have decided not to enter their credentials or encountered an issue during the login process.
   5) [Step 5] The user clicked on the password field and form, but again, no further interactions were recorded, indicating that they did not complete the login process.
   6) [Step 6] The user clicked outside of the form, possibly to navigate away from the page or reconsider their actions, but no subsequent interactions were logged, suggesting a drop-off at this point.
