==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The session starts with the user navigating to the settings page (log_1758985242334_sdckpcitq), then clicking on an "Add" button (log_1758985244978_iwp6mwb31). After that, the user interacts with some UI elements (logs from 1758985245310_oskul68ek and 1758985244978_b96fzs7iv), but no subsequent action indicates a form submission or any other clear conversion event. The final logs show the user interacting with various UI elements (logs from 1758985250359_qdfuhfqg7, 1758985250403_j67l7d4qb, and 1758985250359_a50v3w504), but there is no clear indication that the user has completed their intended action or left the page.

   Step 1: User navigates to the settings page (log_1758985242334_sdckpcitq)
   Step 2: User clicks on an "Add" button (log_1758985244978_iwp6mwb31)
   Step 3: User interacts with various UI elements without performing a clear conversion action (logs from 1758985245310_oskul68ek, 1758985244978_b96fzs7iv, 1758985250359_qdfuhfqg7, and 1758985250403_j67l7d4qb)
   Step 4: User continues interacting with UI elements without any clear indication of a conversion or drop-off (logs from 1758985250359_a50v3w504 and beyond).
