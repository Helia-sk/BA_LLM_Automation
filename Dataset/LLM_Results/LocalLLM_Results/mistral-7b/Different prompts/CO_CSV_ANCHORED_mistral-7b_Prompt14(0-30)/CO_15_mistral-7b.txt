==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The session started with a page view (log_1758982282530_ew7a529gr), followed by a click on the "Customer Login" button (log_1758982299417_vimywuxpt). However, there were subsequent clicks and input changes in the login form but no final submission or further navigation. The session ends with the user interaction on the login form without a successful login.

   Step 1: User navigated to the homepage (log_1758982282530_ew7a529gr) from another page (presumably the dashboard settings).
   Step 2: User clicked on the "Customer Login" button.
   Step 3: User entered their credentials in the login form, but no final submission or further navigation was made. The session ended with user interactions on the login form without a successful login.
