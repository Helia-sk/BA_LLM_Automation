 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user journey did not result in a successful login or any subsequent actions that would indicate a conversion, such as placing an order or navigating to another page associated with the conversion event. Instead, after clicking on the "Restaurant Partners" link at the beginning of the session, the user proceeded to click on the "Register your restaurant or log in to manage orders" link, but did not actually perform a login or take any other action that would indicate a conversion.

   Step 1: The user navigated to the restaurant's login page (/restaurant/login) at timestamp 2025-09-27T14:24:47.044Z, possibly intending to log in or register.

   Step 2: At timestamp 2025-09-27T14:24:47.706Z, the user clicked on the "UsernamePasswordSign In" form but did not enter any username or password.

   Step 3: The user then clicked on the "username" input field at timestamp 2025-09-27T14:24:47.916Z, possibly intending to type in a username, but did not actually enter any text.

   Step 4: At timestamp 2025-09-27T14:24:47.916Z, the user clicked on the "username" input field again, suggesting they may have intended to clear the field or make some other adjustment.

   Step 5: The user clicked on the "username" input field once more at timestamp 2025-09-27T14:24:48.603Z, but did not enter any text.

   Step 6: At timestamp 2025-09-27T14:24:49.343Z, the user entered "User1" as the username and clicked away from the field (blur event), indicating that they had filled out the username field but did not proceed with the login process or take any other action that would indicate a conversion.

   Step 7: The user clicked on the password input field at timestamp 2025-09-27T14:24:49.603Z, but did not enter any text and did not proceed with the login process or take any other action that would indicate a conversion.

   Step 8: The user clicked on the "password" input field again at timestamp 2025-09-27T14:24:50.328Z, but did not enter any text and did not proceed with the login process or take any other action that would indicate a conversion.

   Step 9: At timestamp 2025-09-27T14:24:51.053Z, the user clicked on the "Sign In" button, but did not enter any valid credentials and did not proceed with the login process or take any other action that would indicate a conversion.

   Step 10: The user then clicked on various links within the page and navigated away from the login page at timestamp 2025-09-27T14:26:34.647Z, indicating that they had not successfully logged in or taken any other action that would indicate a conversion.

   The session can be considered a drop-off as the user did not perform a login or take any subsequent actions that would indicate a successful conversion.
