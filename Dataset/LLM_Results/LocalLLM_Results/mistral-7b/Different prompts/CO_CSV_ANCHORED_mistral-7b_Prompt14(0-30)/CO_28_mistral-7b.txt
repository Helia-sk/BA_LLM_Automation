==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The session started with a login attempt (log_1758985849132_sm9gb6j5r, log_1758985849134_5na5ry90h), followed by an input change event for the password field (log_1758985849032_pt9psc4kp). However, there is no subsequent form submit event, indicating that the user did not complete the login process.

   User Journey:
   1) [Step 1] The user navigated to the restaurant login page (/restaurant/login).
   2) [Step 2] The user entered their username and password (implied by the form_submit event).
   3) [Step 3] The user changed the password input value (input_change event), but did not submit the form.
   4) [Step 4] The session ended without a successful login (no subsequent events after log_1758985849032_pt9psc4kp).
