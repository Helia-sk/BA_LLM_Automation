 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The session starts at the dashboard page, then scrolls down to the restaurant page but there is no interaction with any elements on that page. After that, the user clicks on an image which has a text "No image available", indicating that they were trying to view more information about the restaurant, but there wasn't any available. The next logs show scrolling events but no further interactions or navigation to different pages, suggesting the user did not complete any actions that would typically lead to a conversion (e.g., ordering food).
