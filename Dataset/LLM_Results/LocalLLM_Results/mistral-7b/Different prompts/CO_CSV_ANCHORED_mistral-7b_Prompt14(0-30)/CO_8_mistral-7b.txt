==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The session shows multiple user interactions with the username and password input fields, indicating an attempt to log in. However, no subsequent logs show a successful submission or any other activity that could be considered a conversion event (e.g., adding an item to a cart, completing a form, etc.). Therefore, this session appears to have been dropped off before reaching a conversion point.

1) [Step 1] User navigates to the customer login page.
2) [Step 2] User clicks on the "Customer Login" button.
3) [Step 3] User clicks on the "Username" input field.
4) [Step 4] User types a character or characters into the "Username" field (log_1757773780414_4g211r8g2).
5) [Step 5] User clicks on the "Username" input field again, possibly to correct or edit their entry. This action is not explicitly shown in the logs but can be inferred (log_1757773797835_uwv7j48g2).
6) [Step 6] User clicks on the "Username" input field again, possibly to complete their entry. This action is not explicitly shown in the logs but can be inferred (log_1757773797385_uwv7j47ib).
7) [Step 7] User clicks on the "Password" input field.
8) [Step 8] User types a character or characters into the "Password" field, but no subsequent actions are logged, suggesting that they may have left the page without successfully logging in (logs from log_1757773798425_q4q27vmpw to log_1757773797833_std7mojhy do not show any further user interaction).
