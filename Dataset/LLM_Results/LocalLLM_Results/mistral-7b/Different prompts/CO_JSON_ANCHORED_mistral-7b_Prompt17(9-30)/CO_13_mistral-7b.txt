==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user initiated a task (clicking on "History" menu item) but did not complete it, instead closing the page by clicking on the "X" button. This suggests that the user abandoned the session without completing the intended action (viewing order history details).

   Outline of User Journey:
   1) [Step 1] The user opened the web application with URL "/restaurant/dashboard/history".
   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "History" menu item to view the order history.
   3) [Step 3] The user did not find the expected information in the order history and decided to close the page by clicking on the "X" button.
   Note: I considered all the logs provided, but there is no evidence of any other initiated tasks being completed after the user clicked on the "History" menu item. This indicates that the session was abandoned without completion of intended action.
