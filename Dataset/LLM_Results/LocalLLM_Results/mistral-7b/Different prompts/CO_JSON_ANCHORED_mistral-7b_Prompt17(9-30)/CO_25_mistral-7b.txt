 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: Although the user initiated tasks by clicking on the "Menu" link, the user did not complete any further initiated tasks such as scrolling or clicking again. The user navigated to the menu page but did not perform any other actions on that page, which indicates a drop-off.

3) [Step 3] User clicked on the "Menu" link located on the dashboard.
