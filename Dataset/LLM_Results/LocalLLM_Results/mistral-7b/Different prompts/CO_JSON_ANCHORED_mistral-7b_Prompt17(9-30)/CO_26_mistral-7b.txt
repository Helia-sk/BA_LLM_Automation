 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: While the user initiated several tasks, such as clicking on the "Add Item" button and navigating through menu items, it appears that one of the initiated tasks was abandoned, specifically the task related to uploading an image for a new item. This indicates that the user did not complete all the necessary steps required to add a new item, which suggests a drop-off.

   Here is the user journey step-by-step:
   1) [Step 1] The user navigated to the restaurant's dashboard menu page.
   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "Add Item" button to initiate adding a new item.
   3) [Step 3] The user navigated through different menu categories such as Starters, Main Courses, Desserts, Drinks, and Side Dishes.
   4) [Step 4] The user clicked on the area where images could be uploaded or selected for the new item but did not proceed with the upload process, indicating an abandonment of this initiated task. This suggests a drop-off in the user journey as the user did not complete all necessary steps to add a new item.
