 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user initially navigated to the History page (log 5), but then clicked on an "X" button to close it, suggesting they did not wish to view the details of the history item. Later, they clicked on the "History" link again (log 10), indicating a possible attempt to return to the History page, but no further actions were recorded after that. Since the user did not complete any initiated tasks, the session can be classified as a drop-off.
