 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user did not complete the final task, which was to enter their username and password. They only clicked on the "Customer Login" button, but no further interaction with the form fields was recorded.

   1) [Step 1] The user navigated to the customer login page (as indicated by clicking the "Customer Login" link).
   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the username input field, which is an indication that they intended to enter their username. However, no data was entered.
   3) [Step 3] The user clicked on the password input field, but again, no data was entered.
   4) [Step 4] The user clicked on the "Customer Login" button, which would typically submit the form. However, no further interaction with the page was recorded, suggesting that they may have encountered an issue or decided to leave the site without logging in.
   Note: The logs do not provide information about any potential errors or issues that might have occurred during this session, but the lack of data entry and subsequent lack of form submission are strong indicators of a drop-off.
