==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user initiated a task (clicking on the "Restaurant Login" link) but did not complete it by entering any username or password. Instead, they clicked on the "Already have an account? Sign in" button, which indicates that they may have intended to sign up instead, thus abandoning the initial login task.

   User Journey:
   1) [Step 1] The user visited the Restaurant Login page.
   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "Restaurant Login" link.
   3) [Step 3] Instead of entering a username or password, the user clicked on the "Already have an account? Sign in" button, indicating they may not have had the intention to log in.
   The subsequent logs do not show any further interaction that would complete the login task, thus confirming our initial assessment as a drop-off.
