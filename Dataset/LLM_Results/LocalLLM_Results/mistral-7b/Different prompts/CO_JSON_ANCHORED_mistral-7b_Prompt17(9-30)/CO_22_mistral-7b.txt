==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user initiated two tasks (clicking on the "Register your restaurant" link and filling out the username field), but did not complete either of those tasks. Instead, they clicked on the "Log in to manage orders" link, which indicates that their intent was likely to log in, not register a new restaurant. However, after clicking on that link, there are no subsequent logs showing any attempt to enter a password or submit a login.

   User Journey:
   1) [Step 1] The user navigated to the Restaurant Partners page and clicked on the "Restaurant Partners" link in the main navigation.
   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "Register your restaurant or log in to manage orders" link within the landing section of the Restaurant Partners page.
   3) [Step 3] The user clicked on the "Log in to manage orders" link, which led them to the login page.
   4) [Step 4] There are no subsequent logs showing any interaction with the login form (entering a password or submitting a login), so it appears that the user navigated away from the site without completing the intended task.
