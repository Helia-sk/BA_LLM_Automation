 Tag: Conversion

   Reason: The user initiated a click on the "Hungry? Order delicious food from local restaurants" link, but this action does not prevent the session from being considered as a conversion. After clicking the link, the user continued to interact with the page by clicking the username input field, the password input field, and eventually submitting the login form. This sequence of actions indicates that the user was engaged enough to proceed with the intended action on the site (logging in), which is a key component of a conversion event.

   1) The user lands on the homepage (http://localhost:5173/customer/login).

   2) The user clicks on the "Hungry? Order delicious food from local restaurants" link, indicating interest in the service.

   3) The user moves the cursor to the username input field and clicks it, indicating that they are readying themselves to enter their username.

   4) The user enters text into the username input field, suggesting that they are providing a username.

   5) The user clicks on the password input field, indicating that they are readying themselves to enter their password.

   6) The user interacts with the password input field by typing in text, implying that they are entering their password.

   7) The user clicks on the login form, submitting the username and password. This action indicates that the user is attempting to log in.

   The user's journey concludes at step 7 with an attempt to log in, which we have determined constitutes a conversion event. The fact that the user clicked on the "Hungry?" link early in their session does not affect the classification of this session as a conversion because they completed subsequent actions relevant to the site's intended purpose.
