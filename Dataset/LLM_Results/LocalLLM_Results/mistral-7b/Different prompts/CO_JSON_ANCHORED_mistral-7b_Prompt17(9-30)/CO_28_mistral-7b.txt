 Tag: Drop-Off

  1) [Step 1] The user first navigated to the login page for the restaurant, which indicates an intent to start a session (log with event_name "form_submit").
  2) [Step 2] The user filled out the form and submitted it (log with event_name "form_submit"), but there was no subsequent log indicating a successful sign-in event.
  3) [Step 3] After submitting the form, the user clicked on the "Sign In" button again (log with event_name "click"), which suggests they might have made an error and were trying to correct it.
  4) [Step 4] The user changed the value of the password field (log with event_name "input_change"), but there is no subsequent log indicating a successful sign-in event, suggesting that this attempt was also unsuccessful.
  5) [Step 5] The user clicked on another button (log with event_name "click") without any further action, which could indicate confusion or frustration, leading to the drop-off of the session.

The reason for classifying this session as a drop-off is that although the user initially showed intent to start a session, they did not complete all initiated tasks (signing in) and there were no indications of further engagement after the unsuccessful attempts. The user journey was started but not completed. All logs have been considered.
