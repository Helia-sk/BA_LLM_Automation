 Tag: Conversion

  1) The user first visited the homepage of the application ("/customer/dashboard").
  2) They clicked on the "Restaurants" link, navigating to a new page ("/customer/dashboard/restaurant").
  3) On this page, they scrolled down and interacted with an image by clicking on it. This action indicates that they are interested in viewing more details about the restaurant.
  4) They then scrolled back up and clicked on the "No image available" placeholder, possibly to see if there was any hidden content or if the image would appear later.
  5) Next, they found a restaurant they were interested in and clicked on it, initiating an action that presumably leads to placing an order or making a reservation ("/customer/dashboard/restaurant/9").
  6) After viewing this specific restaurant's details, they clicked the "Added to cart" button, implying they have added the restaurant to their cart for future ordering or reservation.
  7) Finally, they clicked the button labeled "Added to cart", which indicates a confirmation of their action, and then scrolled back up on the page ("/customer/dashboard/restaurant/9").

Since all initiated tasks were completed (clicking on the "Restaurants" link, interacting with the restaurant image, clicking on a specific restaurant, adding it to cart, and confirming the action), this session can be considered a conversion. The user found a restaurant they wanted to order from or make a reservation for, and successfully initiated these actions within the application.
