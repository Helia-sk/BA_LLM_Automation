 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The session was initiated with a click on the "Customer Login" button (log_1757773015075_4wi4zz4v7), followed by a scroll event (log_1757773013317_qjhw9th5q and log_1757773012670_mp8atqp66) indicating the user navigated to the customer login page, but no further events related to entering a username or password were logged. This suggests that the user did not complete the intended task of logging in, which is a drop-off.

   Step-by-step user journey:
   1) The user initiated a session by accessing the homepage (implicit as it's the starting point for all sessions).
   2) The user clicked on the "Customer Login" button located at x:598, y:37 (log_1757773015075_4wi4zz4v7).
   3) The user scrolled down the customer login page to view its contents (log_1757773013317_qjhw9th5q and log_1757773012670_mp8atqp66).
   4) The user did not enter any credentials or perform any other actions related to the login process, indicating a drop-off.
