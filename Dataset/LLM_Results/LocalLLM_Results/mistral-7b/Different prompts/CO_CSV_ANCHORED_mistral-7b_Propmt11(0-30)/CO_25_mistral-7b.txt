 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The session initiated with a click event on the "/api/menu/" page, but there was no subsequent event indicating a completed task. The user navigated to the "/api/menu/22" page and did not perform any other action before the end of the session.

   Step 1) [Session started] - A new session (session_id: anonymous) was initiated, likely from a browser (browser_id: unknown). The user navigated to the "/api/menu/" page.

   Step 2) [Click event on menu] - The user clicked on the "Menu" link, which took them to the "/api/menu/22" page.

   Step 3) [Scroll and click events on /api/menu/22] - The user performed a scroll event and another click event on the "/api/menu/22" page, but no subsequent events were recorded, indicating that the task was abandoned or incomplete.

   Step 4) [Session ended] - The session ended without any completed tasks, classifying it as a drop-off.
