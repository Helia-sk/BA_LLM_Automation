==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user initiated the session by navigating to the home page (`/customer/dashboard`) and clicked on "Restaurants", indicating an interest. However, the user did not proceed further to any specific restaurant page. Instead, they scrolled down the restaurants page but did not click on any restaurant link or interact with any other elements there. After that, the user navigated to a specific restaurant page (`/customer/dashboard/restaurant/9`) and briefly viewed the "No image available" placeholder for the restaurant's image before scrolling down again without taking any further action. This sequence of events suggests that the user did not find what they were looking for or were not engaged enough to complete a conversion (e.g., placing an order, viewing more details about the restaurant).
