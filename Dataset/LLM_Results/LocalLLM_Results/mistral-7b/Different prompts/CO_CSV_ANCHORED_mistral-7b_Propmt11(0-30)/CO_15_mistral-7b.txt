 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The session was initiated with a navigation to the '/customer/login' page, but the user did not complete the login process. Instead, the log file shows multiple interactions with the username and password input fields, indicating an attempt to enter credentials, but no 'click.v1' event for the 'Customer Login' button was recorded, which suggests that the user abandoned the login process.

   1) [Step 1] Navigation to the '/customer/login' page (initiated).
   2) [Step 2] Click on the 'Customer Login' button (initiated).
   3) [Step 3] Interaction with the username input field (initiated).
   4) [Step 4] Interaction with the password input field (initiated, but not completed).
   5) No further interaction suggesting a completion of any task was recorded, indicating that the user abandoned the login process.
