 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user initiated the task of navigating to the customer login page (Step 4), but did not complete it by clicking on the "Customer Login" button. However, we cannot definitively classify this session as a conversion or drop-off based solely on this data, as there might have been other tasks initiated in this session that were completed or abandoned.

   3) [Step 3] - The user initiated the task of going to the customer login page (/customer/login) by clicking on the "Customer Login" link.
   4) [Step 4] - The user did not complete the task of logging in by clicking on the "Customer Login" button, indicating a potential drop-off. However, further data is needed to confirm this classification.
