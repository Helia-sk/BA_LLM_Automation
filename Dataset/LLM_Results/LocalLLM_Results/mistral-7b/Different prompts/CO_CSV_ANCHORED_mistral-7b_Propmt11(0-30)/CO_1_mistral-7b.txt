==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The session was not a conversion because the user initiated tasks but did not complete all of them. Specifically, the user clicked on the "Customer Login" link, which is presumably intended to lead to the login page, but no subsequent login event was logged.

   Step 1: User navigated to the customer login page (/customer/login).
   Step 2: User clicked on the "Customer Login" link.
   [No further steps were recorded as the user did not complete the intended task of logging in.]
