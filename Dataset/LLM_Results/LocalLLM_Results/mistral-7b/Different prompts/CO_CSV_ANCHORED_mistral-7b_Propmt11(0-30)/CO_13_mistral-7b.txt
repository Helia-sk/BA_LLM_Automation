Prompt: Analyze the following log file. Determine if the session was a drop-off, a conversion.Consider every initiated task, A task counts as a conversion only if it is fully completed. If all initiated tasks are completed → Tag: Conversion. If even one initiated tasks are abandoned → Tag: Drop-Off. Provide a reason for your classification. Then, outline the user journey step-by-step.Format your response as follows: Tag: Conversion||Drop-Off  [Reason]. 1) [Step 1] 2) [Step 2] 3) [Step 3] …
==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The session initiated an HTTP request for the "/api/orders/21/details" endpoint but did not follow up with a corresponding HTTP response, indicating that the task was not fully completed.
   1) [Step 1] Session started with an HTTP request (log_1757835963781_2e9f53t2n) for "/restaurant/dashboard/history" with a click event on the "X" button, which was likely intended to close or hide some UI element.
   2) [Step 2] The session made another HTTP request (log_1757835961979_hw4mtgead) for the same URL with a click event on the "View Details" button, indicating an intent to view order details.
   3) [Step 3] The session initiated an HTTP request (log_1757835964770_mkg4r77nu) for "/api/orders/21/details", but there was no corresponding HTTP response, suggesting that the task of viewing order details was abandoned or unsuccessful.
   4) [Step 4] The session ended with another click event (log_1757835964770_bxxdd7utl) on the "Done" button, which could have been intended to save and close the UI, but no subsequent events were recorded, so it's unclear if this action was successful or not.

The session started with an intent to view order details (Step 2), but that task was abandoned (Step 3). Since at least one initiated task was not completed, this session should be classified as a drop-off. The user journey stops at Step 3 because the incomplete task suggests that the user navigated away from the application or encountered an error that prevented the task from being finished.
