 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The session was not a conversion because the user initiated but did not complete the final task, which is clicking on the "Customer Login" link.

   Step-by-step user journey:
   1) The user navigated to the "/customer/login" page (log_1757773371689_3ak46jhcx).
   2) The user clicked on the "UsernamePasswordSign In" form (log_1757773372596_2oj0c59xu).
   3) The user then clicked on the username input field (log_1757773373072_scoku9tbi).
   4) The user clicked on the password input field (not logged, but it can be inferred as a natural next step after clicking the username field).
   5) The user did not complete the session by clicking on the "Customer Login" link. Instead, the session ended after the last logged event, which was the user clicking on the password input field (log_1757773372596_qk2cml25q).
