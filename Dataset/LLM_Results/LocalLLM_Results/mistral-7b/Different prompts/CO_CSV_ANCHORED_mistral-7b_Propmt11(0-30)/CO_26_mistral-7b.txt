Then, outline the user journey step-by-step.Format your response as follows: Tag: Conversion||Drop-Off  [Reason]. 1) [Step 1] 2) [Step 2] 3) [Step 3] …
==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user initiated the task of adding an item to the menu, but did not complete it, indicating that the action was abandoned.

   User Journey:
   1) [Step 1] The user accessed the restaurant's dashboard menu page (/restaurant/dashboard/menu).
   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on a button to add an item (log_1758985597816_qudvz81oz). This counts as initiated task.
   3) [Step 3] The user selected an item to add (not specified in the log), but did not complete the process, suggesting that the action was abandoned (no further logs indicate completion of this task).
   4) [Step 4] The user clicked on a different menu item (log_1758985597527_w11zz2b0e), but did not interact with it further, indicating potential interest or exploration.
   5) [Step 5] The user clicked on another menu item, but this time an SVG element, which is likely a back or close button (log_1758985593634_wnpmodruc), implying that the user decided to exit without completing any tasks.

   The session ended as a drop-off because only one of the initiated tasks was abandoned, and no further interactions were made to complete those tasks or initiate new ones before exiting.
