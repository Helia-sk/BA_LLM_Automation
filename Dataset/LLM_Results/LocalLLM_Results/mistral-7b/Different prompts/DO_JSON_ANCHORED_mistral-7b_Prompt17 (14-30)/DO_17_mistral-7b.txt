 Tag: Drop-Off

   Reason: Although the user initiated the session by clicking on the "Restaurant Partners" link and then clicked on the login form, they did not proceed to complete any of the subsequent tasks related to filling out the username and password fields. Therefore, based on the initiated but uncompleted tasks, this session can be classified as a drop-off.

   User Journey:
   1) The user clicked on the "Restaurant Partners" link (Log 8).
   2) The user clicked on the login form (Log 9).
   3) The user did not fill out the username field (No corresponding log found for this task).
   4) The user did not fill out the password field (No corresponding log found for this task).
   Since the user did not complete any of the subsequent tasks related to filling out the login form, this session can be classified as a drop-off.
