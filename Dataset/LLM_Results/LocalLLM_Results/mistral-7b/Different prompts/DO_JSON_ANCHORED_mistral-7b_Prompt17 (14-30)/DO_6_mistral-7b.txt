   Reason: While the user initiated several actions, they did not complete one of the main tasks (i.e., logging in or ordering food). The user clicked on the "Hungry? Order delicious food from local restaurants" link and the "Login to your account" link, but no further actions indicating a successful login or food order were observed.

   Step 3: The user clicked on the "Hungry? Order delicious food from local restaurants" link, which took them to the homepage of a food ordering service.
   Step 4: The user scrolled through the food ordering service's homepage.
   Step 5: The user returned to the original website (http://localhost:5173/).
   Step 6: The user clicked on the "Login to your account" link, which took them to the login page.
   Step 7: The user scrolled through the login page.
