 Tag: Conversion

   Reason: The user successfully completed every initiated task. They clicked on the "Lieferspatz" link, navigated to the homepage, clicked on the "Customer Login" link, and finally interacted with the username input field. No steps were abandoned during the session.

   1) [Step 1] The user clicked on the "Lieferspatz" link from the homepage (log: Log_1757764040135).

   2) [Step 2] The user navigated to the "/customer/login" page (implicit, since there is no log for a navigation event, but the next event indicates that the user was on this page).

   3) [Step 3] The user clicked on the "Customer Login" link on the "/customer/login" page (log: Log_1757764057959).

   4) [Step 4] The user interacted with the username input field on the "/customer/login" page (log: Log_1757764058992).

   All the logs were considered, and the session was classified as a conversion since the user completed all initiated tasks.
