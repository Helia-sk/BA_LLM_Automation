 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user initiated the task of logging in (indicated by the "click" event on the username input field), but did not complete it. Instead, they clicked on an SVG element that is likely not a part of the login form, suggesting they may have navigated away from the login page or encountered an issue.

  1) The user landed on the login page (indicated by the initial URL: "http://localhost:5173/restaurant/login").
  2) The user clicked on the username input field to begin entering their username (indicated by the "click" event).
  3) The user entered "User" into the username input field, but did not complete the login process (indicated by no subsequent "input_change" events with a longer username string and no "submit" or "login" events).
  4) The user clicked on an SVG element on the page, suggesting they may have navigated away from the login page or encountered an issue (indicated by the "click" event on the SVG element).

All initiated tasks were not completed, so the session was a drop-off. It's important to note that this analysis is based on the information provided in the log file and does not account for potential user actions outside of the logged events or any server-side processing that may have occurred.
