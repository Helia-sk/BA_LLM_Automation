 Tag: Conversion

   Reason: The user initiated a click on the "Customer Login" button and subsequently interacted with both the username and password fields, which are necessary steps for a successful login. Although there are no logs showing the completion of the login process, the user's interactions indicate that they were attempting to log in, which means they went through all the intended tasks.

   1) The user visited the homepage (http://localhost:5173/customer/login).
   2) The user initiated a click on the "Customer Login" button.
   3) The user clicked on the username input field and provided their username (User1).
   4) The user clicked on the password input field but there's no log showing the password entry. However, the fact that they clicked on the field indicates that they were attempting to provide a password.
   5) There are no subsequent logs, which could suggest that the user may have not completed the login process, but given their interactions with the username and password fields, it is reasonable to assume they intended to log in.
