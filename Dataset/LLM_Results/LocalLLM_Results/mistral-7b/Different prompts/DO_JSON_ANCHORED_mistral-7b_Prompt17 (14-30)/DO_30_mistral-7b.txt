 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user initiated tasks but did not complete them. They clicked on the "Menu" link, navigated to the "dashboard/menu", however they didn't interact with any other element related to adding an item or completing a task in the menu section. Instead, they clicked on the "Accept" button in the dashboard, which seems to be unrelated to the menu navigation, and then closed the session without performing any further actions related to the menu navigation.

1) [Step 1] The user accessed the restaurant's dashboard (http://localhost:5173/restaurant/dashboard).
2) [Step 2] The user navigated to the menu section by clicking on the "Menu" link (<a> tag with id="").
3) [Step 3] The user clicked on the "Accept" button in the dashboard, which does not seem related to the menu navigation.
4) [Step 4] The user closed the session without performing any further actions related to the menu navigation or adding an item.

The logs provided do not show any interaction with the 'Add Item' button in the menu section, which indicates that the initiated task of adding an item was abandoned (drop-off).
