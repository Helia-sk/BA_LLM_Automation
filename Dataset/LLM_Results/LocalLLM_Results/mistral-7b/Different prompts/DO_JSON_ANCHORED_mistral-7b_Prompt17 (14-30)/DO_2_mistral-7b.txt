==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: Although the user interacted with two links, one for the restaurant login and another for the customer login, neither of these actions was followed by further interactions that would indicate a successful completion of those tasks. Instead, there is a scroll event after both clicks without any subsequent interaction, which may suggest that the user did not complete either of the attempted logins or navigated away from the site.

   User Journey:
   1) [Step 1] The user arrived at the homepage (http://localhost:5173/).
   2) [Step 2] The user scrolled down the page (scroll event).
   3) [Step 3] The user clicked on the "Restaurant Login" link (click event, http://localhost:5173/restaurant/login).
   4) [Step 4] The user scrolled further down the page after clicking the "Restaurant Login" link (scroll event).
   5) [Step 5] The user clicked on the "Customer Login" link (click event, http://localhost:5173/customer/login).
   6) [Step 6] The user scrolled further down the page after clicking the "Customer Login" link (scroll event).
   7) [Step 7] The user did not engage in any subsequent actions, only scrolling events were recorded. This suggests that the user either abandoned the site or navigated away without completing the initiated tasks (login for either restaurant or customer accounts).
