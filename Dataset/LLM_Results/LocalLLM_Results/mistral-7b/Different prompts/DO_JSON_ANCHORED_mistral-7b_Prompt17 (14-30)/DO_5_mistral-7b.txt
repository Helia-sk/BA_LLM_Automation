==================================================

 Tag: Conversion
   Reason: The user initiated tasks (scrolling, clicking on a link) and completed them by reaching the login page and entering their details, which indicates an intended interaction with the site, implying a conversion.
   1) [Step 1] The user landed on the homepage of the website (http://localhost:5173/).
   2) [Step 2] The user scrolled down the page to view the content.
   3) [Step 3] The user clicked on a link that led them to the login page (http://localhost:5173/customer/login).
   4) [Step 4] The user entered their credentials and logged in to the application.
   5) [Step 5] The user scrolled further within the login page, indicating they were likely filling out additional fields or verifying their information.
   The logs do not show any evidence of the user abandoning the site after the initial scroll, so it can be assumed that the user completed their intended task (logging in) and did not drop off.
