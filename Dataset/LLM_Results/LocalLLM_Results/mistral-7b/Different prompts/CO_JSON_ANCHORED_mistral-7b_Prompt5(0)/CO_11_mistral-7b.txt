 Tag: Drop-off

   Reason: The user navigated away from the site after accessing the main dashboard but did not proceed to any specific page or perform a conversion action such as making a purchase, filling out a form, or signing up for an account.

   1) [Step 1] - User accessed the customer dashboard (URL: http://localhost:5173/customer/dashboard). This could represent the beginning of a session if the user arrived from an external source or the resumption of a previous session.

   2) [Step 2] - The user scrolled down the page to view more content on the dashboard (event: scroll, timestamp: 2025-09-13T14:37:56.450Z). This could indicate that the user was exploring or searching for a specific item or action to perform.

   3) [Step 3] - The user continued to scroll down the dashboard page (event: scroll, timestamp: 2025-09-13T14:37:55.386Z). However, they did not interact with any elements on the page or navigate to a different page within the site.

   4) [Step 4] - The user scrolled up slightly (event: scroll, timestamp: 2025-09-13T14:37:54.528Z). This could suggest that they were trying to find a specific item or return to a previous position on the page.

   5) [Step 5] - The user did not perform any additional actions within the site, and the session ended without any conversion event taking place (event: scroll, timestamp: <2025-09-13T14:37:54.528Z)). This indicates that the session was a drop-off, as the user did not engage in an intended action or navigate to another page within the site.
