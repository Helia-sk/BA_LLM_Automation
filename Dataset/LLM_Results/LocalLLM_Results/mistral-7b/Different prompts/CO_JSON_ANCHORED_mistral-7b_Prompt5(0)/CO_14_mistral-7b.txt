==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user did not complete the desired action (form submission or purchasing an item, etc.) within the session.

   1) [Step 1] User clicks on the "Customer Login" link located at the top right corner of the webpage.
   2) [Step 2] Upon arriving at the login page, the user does not enter any credentials and instead clicks on the username input field.
   3) [Step 3] The user then clicks on the password input field without entering any data.
   4) [Step 4] User clicks on the "Username" input field again.
   5) [Step 5] User clicks outside of the username input field, which triggers a debounced input event.
   6) [Step 6] The user clicks on the password input field and does not enter any data before clicking away from it.
   7) [Step 7] User clicks on the username input field again, followed by another click outside of the input field, triggering another debounced input event.
   8) [Step 8] The user clicks on the "Username" input field for a third time before clicking away from it without entering any data.
   9) [Step 9] User clicks on the username input field one last time and then clicks the login button, which does not result in form submission or redirect to another page.
   The user's session ended after this sequence of interactions without completing the desired action, so it is classified as a drop-off.
