 Tag: Drop-Off

   Reason: The user visited multiple pages, interacted with several elements, but did not perform the intended action (making a purchase or completing a form).

   1) [Step 1] The user navigated to the dashboard page of the restaurant application (`/restaurant/dashboard`) indicating that they are engaged and exploring the app.
   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "History" link, which suggests that they were interested in viewing past orders or transactions.
   3) [Step 3] The user viewed details for one of the history items by clicking on the "View Details" button.
   4) [Step 4] The user decided not to take any further action (such as making a new order or editing the history item) and instead chose to reject the current session by closing the application. This indicates a drop-off in the user journey since they did not complete the intended goal of the app.
