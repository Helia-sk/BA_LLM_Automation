==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The session does not show any action that leads to a purchase or completion of a desired goal. Instead, the user navigated through different pages on the website, but there is no evidence of a final interaction that indicates a conversion.

   Step 1: [The user opened the website (http://localhost:5173/restaurant/dashboard)] The user initiated a new session by opening the webpage.

   Step 2: [The user clicked on "History"] The user navigated to the History section of the dashboard.

   Step 3: [The user clicked on "View Details"] The user selected a specific item in the history list, presumably to view more details about it.

   Step 4: [The user clicked on "X"] After viewing some information, the user decided to close the details popup by clicking on the "X" button.

   Step 5: [The user clicked on another element in the history list (possibly multiple times)] The user interacted with other items in the history list, but without any conclusive evidence of a purchase or a final interaction that indicates a conversion.

   Step 6: [The session ended] The user did not perform any actions that could lead to a conversion, and eventually closed the website, ending the session.
