   1) [Step 1] User clicks on the "Customer Login" link (log_1757773371689_3ak46jhcx).
   2) [Step 2] User arrives at the Customer Login page (http://localhost:5173/customer/login).
   3) [Step 3] User clicks on the "UsernamePasswordSign In" text (log_1757773372596_2oj0c59xu).
   4) [Step 4] User clicks on the username input field (log_1757773373072_scoku9tbi).
   5) [Step 5] User clicks outside of the form (log_1757773373072_scoku9tbi), which indicates a potential intent to leave the page without interacting with the form. However, there are no subsequent interactions suggesting a drop-off or conversion. The session ended at this point, indicating a drop-off.
