 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The session ended without any interaction with the login form that would indicate a successful sign-in or navigation to the dashboard page, which is typically the next step after signing in.

   Step 1: The user visited the restaurant's website on Chrome version 140.0.0.0.

   Step 2: The user navigated to the login page, possibly due to wanting to access a protected area of the site or their account.

   Step 3: The user entered their credentials (password length was 0, suggesting no password was entered) into the login form and clicked the "Sign In" button.

   Step 4: After clicking the "Sign In" button, the user did not interact with any element on the page, such as the dashboard or other pages, indicating they may have encountered an issue with the login process or decided to leave the site without signing in.

   Step 5: The session ended without further interaction from the user.
