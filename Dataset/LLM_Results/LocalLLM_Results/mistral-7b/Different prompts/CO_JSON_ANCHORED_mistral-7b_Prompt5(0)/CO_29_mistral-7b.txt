 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The session did not result in a clear conversion event such as a purchase or signup. The user navigated through different sections of the dashboard (History, Details, etc.) but did not perform an action that indicates a completion of a goal.

   Step 1) [User logged in to their account] - The session started with the user logging into their account, indicating they are an existing user.

   Step 2) [Navigated to History] - The user navigated to the 'History' section, presumably to view their previous transactions or activities.

   Step 3) [Clicked on View Details] - The user clicked on the 'View Details' button for one of the items in the history list.

   Step 4) [Navigated to Details] - The user was redirected to the 'Details' page for the selected item.

   Step 5) [Clicked on X button] - The user clicked the 'X' button to close the details modal or popup.

   Step 6) [Navigated back to History] - The user returned to the 'History' section.

   Step 7) [Clicked on History again] - The user clicked on the 'History' link again, possibly to re-examine the list of items.

   Step 8) [Closed the session] - The user closed the browser or navigated away from the site, ending the session.
