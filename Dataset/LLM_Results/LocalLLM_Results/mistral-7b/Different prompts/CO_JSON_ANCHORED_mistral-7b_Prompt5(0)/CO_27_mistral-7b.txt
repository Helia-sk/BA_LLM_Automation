==================================================

 Tag: Drop-off
   Reason: The session did not result in an acceptance of the order, which is a crucial step for a conversion.
   1) [Step 1] The user (anonymous) accessed the website using Chrome browser on Windows 10 at http://localhost:5173/restaurant/dashboard.
   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on a button with text "Accept" at x=711, y=641 in the frontend application. However, this action did not trigger an HTTP request to the backend server related to accepting an order (endpoint: orders.accept_order).
   3) [Step 3] The user's browser made an OPTIONS request to the same endpoint, suggesting that it was checking for available methods or options.
   4) [Step 4] The browser then made a POST request to the same endpoint but did not receive any response, indicating that the server did not process this request (HTTP response with status code 200).
   5) [Step 5] There were no subsequent interactions or events recorded in this session.
