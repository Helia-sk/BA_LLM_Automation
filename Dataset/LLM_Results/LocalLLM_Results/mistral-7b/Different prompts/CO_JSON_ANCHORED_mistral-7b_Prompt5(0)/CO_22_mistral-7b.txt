==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The session ended without any form of user interaction with the main goal (logging in or registering as a restaurant partner). The user clicked on the "Restaurant Partners" link, but this action does not lead to the desired outcome.

   1) [Step 1] User navigates to the Restaurant Partners login/registration page ("/restaurant/login") from an external source (not shown in logs).
   2) [Step 2] User clicks on the "Restaurant Partners" link at the bottom of the page.
   3) [Step 3] User is redirected to another page, but this page does not contain a login or registration form, so no interaction with the main goal occurs.
   4) [Step 4] The session ends without any further user interaction with the login/registration process.
