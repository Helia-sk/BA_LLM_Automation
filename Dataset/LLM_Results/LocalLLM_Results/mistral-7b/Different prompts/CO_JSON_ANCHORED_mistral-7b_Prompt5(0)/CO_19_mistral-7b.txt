==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user did not complete the intended action, which was to log in as a customer. Instead, they navigated away from the customer login page and returned to the restaurant dashboard settings page.

   1) [Step 1] The user visited the homepage ("/") at 2025-09-27T14:18:55.683Z, possibly after clicking on a link or refreshing the page.
   2) [Step 2] At 2025-09-27T14:19:05.841Z, the user clicked on the "Customer Login" link located at x=1659, y=19. This action navigated the user to the customer login page ("/customer/login").
   3) [Step 3] The user then interacted with the username input field by clicking on it at x=910, y=309. However, no further actions related to entering a username or password were recorded.
   4) [Step 4] At 2025-09-27T14:19:06.939Z, the user clicked somewhere else on the customer login page, potentially to navigate away from it.
   5) [Step 5] At 2025-09-27T14:19:46.939Z, the user returned to the restaurant dashboard settings page ("/restaurant/dashboard/settings"), but no further interactions were recorded in this session.

Since the user did not complete the intended action of logging in as a customer and instead navigated away from the customer login page, this session is classified as a drop-off.
