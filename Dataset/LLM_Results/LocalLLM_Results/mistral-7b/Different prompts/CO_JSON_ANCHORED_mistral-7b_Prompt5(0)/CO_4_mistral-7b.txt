==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The session did not result in a successful conversion (i.e., the user did not complete the sign-up process or perform any action that would typically be considered a conversion).
   1) [Step 1] The user clicked on the "Restaurant Login" link, indicating they intended to access the login page for the restaurant's website.
   2) [Step 2] Upon reaching the login page, the user clicked the "Already have an account? Sign in" button, suggesting that the user may already have an account but needed to log in.
   3) [Step 3] After clicking the "Sign in" button, the user interacted with the username input field by typing something and then clicked outside of it (implicit click event). This could indicate that the user was preparing to enter their username for login.
   4) [Step 4] The user then typed in the password input field, suggesting that they were continuing with the login process. However, since there is no subsequent event indicating a successful login or any further interaction with the site, it's reasonable to assume that the user may have left the page or encountered an issue during the login process.
   5) [Step 5] After entering their password, the user did not perform any actions that would typically be associated with a conversion (e.g., submitting a form, making a purchase, etc.). This lack of further interaction suggests that the session was a drop-off rather than a conversion.
