==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The session ended without any evidence of a conversion (e.g., no 'purchase', 'signup', or similar clear indicators of a desired action). The user interacted with various elements on the page but did not proceed to the final step that would indicate a successful conversion.

   1) [Step 1] User navigated to the homepage ("/customer/dashboard") from an unknown source (not provided in the data).
   2) [Step 2] User scrolled through the page and interacted with elements, but there is no indication of a specific action or interest in a particular restaurant.
   3) [Step 3] User clicked on a restaurant ("/customer/dashboard/restaurant/4") from the list, but again, there is no clear indication of further interaction or engagement that would suggest a conversion.
   4) [Step 4] User scrolled through the restaurant details page and interacted with elements such as images and text, but did not take any action that could be considered a conversion.
   5) [Step 5] User clicked on an element (scroll event) indicating they continued scrolling down the page but eventually left the site without taking any further action.
   The user's session ended without any clear indication of a successful conversion, suggesting this was a drop-off.
