==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The session ended without a clear indication of the user completing a desired action, such as submitting a form or making a purchase.
   1) [Step 1] The user navigated to the website (http://localhost:5173/customer/login), which suggests they intended to engage with the site.
   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "Customer Login" button, indicating their intent to log in or sign up.
   3) [Step 3] The user entered their username ("User1") and clicked within the username input field twice, suggesting they were typing their username. However, there's no evidence of a password being entered or a form being submitted.
   4) [Step 4] The user clicked on the username input field again without entering any more information, which could indicate confusion or abandonment.
   5) [Step 5] The user clicked outside the username input field and navigated to another input field (presumably the password field), but there's no further interaction recorded after this action, suggesting they may have decided to leave the site without completing their intended action.
