 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user did not complete the desired action, which was to login as a customer. They navigated away from the page they were on (/customer/login) and returned to another page (/restaurant/dashboard/settings).
   1) [Step 1] User navigated to the Customer Login page from the restaurant dashboard settings page.
   2) [Step 2] User clicked on the "Customer Login" button, indicating an intent to log in.
   3) [Step 3] User interacted with the username input field by clicking on it but did not enter any information.
   4) [Step 4] User did not proceed further and left the page, returning to the restaurant dashboard settings page.
   The user did not perform any action that would be considered a conversion (completing the login process). Therefore, this session is classified as a drop-off.
