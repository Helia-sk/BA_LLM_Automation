 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user navigated away from the page after performing an initial action (clicking on the "Restaurant Partners" link), but no subsequent interaction indicating completion of a registration or login process was recorded.

   1) [Step 1] User landed on the dashboard page ("/restaurant/dashboard") presumably after completing a previous action, such as logging in or creating an account.
   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "Restaurant Partners" link, indicating they were interested in registering their restaurant or managing orders.
   3) [Step 3] User navigated away from the page by clicking on a different link ("http://localhost:5173/"), which suggests they did not complete the intended action on the "Restaurant Partants" page.
   4) [Step 4] No further interactions were recorded, indicating that the session ended without completion of the registration or login process.
