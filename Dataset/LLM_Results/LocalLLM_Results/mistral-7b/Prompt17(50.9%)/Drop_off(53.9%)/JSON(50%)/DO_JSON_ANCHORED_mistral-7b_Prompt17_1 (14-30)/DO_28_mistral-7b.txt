 Tag: Conversion
   Reason: All initiated tasks in this session were completed. The user clicked on the "Settings" link, which implies they navigated to the desired page (Step 1). Then, the user interacted with a select dropdown, implying they were performing some action within that page (Step 2). Lastly, the user also interacted with another select dropdown, suggesting they continued their action on the page (Step 3). Since all tasks initiated by the user were completed, this session can be classified as a conversion.

   Here is the user journey step-by-step:
   1) The user clicked on the "Settings" link in the navigation bar (indicating they intended to navigate to that page).
   2) Upon reaching the "Settings" page, the user interacted with a select dropdown, implying they were performing some action within that page.
   3) The user continued their interaction by clicking on another select dropdown, suggesting they were engaged in completing their intended action on the page.
