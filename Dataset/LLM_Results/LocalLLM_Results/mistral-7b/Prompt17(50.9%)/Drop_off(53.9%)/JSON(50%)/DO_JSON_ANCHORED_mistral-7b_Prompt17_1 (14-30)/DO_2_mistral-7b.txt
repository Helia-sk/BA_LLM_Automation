==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: Although the user initiated two tasks (clicking on "Restaurant Login" and "Customer Login"), they did not complete any of them. Instead, they scrolled the page twice without performing any actions that would indicate a successful completion of the intended tasks.

   User Journey:
   1) [Step 1] The user navigated to the homepage (http://localhost:5173/).
   2) [Step 2] The user scrolled down the page once, indicating they were exploring the content.
   3) [Step 3] The user clicked on the "Restaurant Login" link, initiating a task to log in as a restaurant user.
   4) [Step 4] The user scrolled down the page again without performing any actions that would indicate a successful completion of the "Restructant Login" task.
   5) [Step 5] The user clicked on the "Customer Login" link, initiating another task to log in as a customer user.
   6) The user did not perform any actions that would indicate a successful completion of this task either, and the session ended with the last scroll event.
   It is important to note that all the logs were considered in making this decision. No tasks were completed, so the session was a drop-off.
