 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user initiated tasks by clicking on the "Restaurant Login" link, but did not complete the login process (indicated by no login attempts found in the logs). However, the user interacted with the username input field twice without providing any data, which suggests that they may have intended to enter their username. But since no password input was observed and no "Submit" or "Login" button click followed, it can be assumed that the session was abandoned.

   User Journey:
   1) [Step 1] The user navigated to the Restaurant Login page by clicking on the "Restaurant Login" link.
   2) [Step 2] The user did not enter any data in the username input field but clicked twice, indicating an intent to enter their username.
   3) [Step 3] No password input was observed and no "Submit" or "Login" button click followed, suggesting that the session was abandoned.
