==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user initiated a task (clicking on the "Restaurant Partners" link, which presumably leads to the registration/login page for restaurants) but did not complete it. Instead, they navigated back to the login page and attempted to enter their username, but no logs indicate that they actually entered anything or clicked the "Sign In" button.

   User Journey:
   1) The user landed on the Restaurant Partners page (presumably from an external source, as there is no log indicating they arrived via the homepage).
   2) The user clicked on the "Restaurant Partners" link, presumably intending to register their restaurant or log in to manage orders. However, this action was not followed by any subsequent logs related to the registration/login process.
   3) The user returned to the login page and clicked on the username input field, indicating an intention to enter their username for the login process.
   4) No further logs indicate that the user entered their password or clicked the "Sign In" button, suggesting they abandoned the login process at this step.
