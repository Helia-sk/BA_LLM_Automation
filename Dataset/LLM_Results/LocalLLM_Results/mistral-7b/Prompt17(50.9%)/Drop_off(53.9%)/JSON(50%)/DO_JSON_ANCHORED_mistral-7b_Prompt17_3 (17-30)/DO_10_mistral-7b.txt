 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user initiated the task of clicking on the "Customer Login" link (log 9), but subsequently did not complete the login process by entering a username and password. This is evident from the logs showing clicks on the username input field and password input field, followed by no corresponding 'input_change' events indicating entry of data.

   User Journey:
   1) [Step 1] The user navigated to the "/customer/login" page (implied by the URL in log 9).
   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "Customer Login" link (log 9).
   3) [Step 3] The user clicked on the username input field (log 10), but did not enter any data.
   4) [Step 4] The user clicked on the password input field (log 11), but did not enter any data.
   5) [Step 5] The user did not perform any subsequent actions related to the login process, indicating they may have abandoned the session.
