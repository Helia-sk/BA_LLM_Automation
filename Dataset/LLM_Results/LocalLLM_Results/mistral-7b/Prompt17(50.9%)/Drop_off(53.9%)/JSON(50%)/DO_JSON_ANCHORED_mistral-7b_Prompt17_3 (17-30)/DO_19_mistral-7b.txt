 Tag: Conversion

   Reason: The user initiated two tasks (clicking on the 'Register your restaurant' link and then entering their username), and completed both of them by providing their username.

   1) [Step 1] User arrived at the Restaurant Partners login/register page.
   2) [Step 2] User clicked on the 'Register your restaurant' link.
   3) [Step 3] User navigated to the registration form, initiated the task of entering their username.
   4) [Step 4] User successfully entered their username and completed the registration process.

   All the logs were considered in my decision making, as I analyzed each event in the log file. The user clicked on a link, navigated to a new page, initiated a task (entering their username), and then completed that task, indicating a conversion.
