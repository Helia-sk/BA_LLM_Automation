 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: One of the initiated tasks (username input) was abandoned, as no subsequent logs related to completing the task were found.

   User Journey Step-by-step:
   1) [Step 1] The user navigated to the restaurant login page from the dashboard menu ("Restaurant Login" click event).
   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the username input field, indicating that they intended to enter their credentials (username input "click" event).
   3) [Step 3] No subsequent logs related to entering a username or password were found.
   4) [Step 4] The user left the login page and navigated to the homepage ("/") without logging in (page_view event).

   It is important to consider all the provided logs before making a decision, as they provide context for each step of the user journey. The absence of logs related to completing the task indicates that the initiated task was abandoned, resulting in a drop-off.
