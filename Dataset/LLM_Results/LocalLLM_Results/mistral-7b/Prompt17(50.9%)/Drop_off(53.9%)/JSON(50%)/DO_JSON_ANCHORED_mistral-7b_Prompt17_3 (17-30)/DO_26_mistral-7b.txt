==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: One of the initiated tasks (user clicking on the "Register your restaurant" link) was abandoned, as the user did not complete the registration process.

   Step 1: The user navigated to the Restaurant Partners page at `http://localhost:5173/restaurant/login` by clicking on the "Restaurant Partners" link from the main page.
   Step 2: The user initiated a task by clicking on the "Register your restaurant" link, but did not complete it (drop-off).
   Step 3: The user navigated to the login form on the Restaurant Partners page.
   Step 4: The user clicked on the username input field (though this doesn't necessarily mean they entered anything).
   Step 5: The user clicked on the password input field.
   Step 6: The user did not perform any action for a while, indicating they may have navigated away from the page or taken a break.
   Step 7: The user clicked on the username input field again.
   Step 8: The user clicked on the "UsernamePasswordSign In" form.
   Step 9: The user clicked on the username input field for the second time.
   Step 10: The user clicked on the password input field again, and then clicked away from it (indicating they likely did not enter anything).
   Step 11: The user did not take any action for a while before eventually closing the session.

All initiated tasks were not completed, so the session was classified as a drop-off.
