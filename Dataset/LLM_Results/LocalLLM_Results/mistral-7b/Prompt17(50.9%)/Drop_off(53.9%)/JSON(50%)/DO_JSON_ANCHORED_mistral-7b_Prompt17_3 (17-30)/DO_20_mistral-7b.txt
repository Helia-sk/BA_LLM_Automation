 Tag: Conversion

   Reason: All initiated tasks were completed. The user clicked on the "Restaurant Login" link, then clicked on the username input field, and subsequently entered "User" into that field (indicating they are filling out the login form). After that, they clicked on the username input field again, which is likely because they wanted to remove the previously entered text. Finally, they entered "User1" into the username input field, indicating they are completing the login process.
