 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user has initiated two tasks (clicking on "Restaurant Login" and "Customer Login") but did not complete any of them, indicating a drop-off.

   1) The user visited the homepage at http://localhost:5173/.
   2) The user scrolled down the page to position 110.4 (log_1757763605641_i0oqvjrbd).
   3) The user clicked on "Restaurant Login" at position (x=488, y=39).
   4) The user scrolled down the page again to position 0 (log_1757763606219_urtfqnl53).
   5) The user clicked on "Customer Login" at position (x=596, y=29).
   Since neither of these initiated tasks were completed, the session is considered a drop-off.
