 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: One of the initiated tasks, specifically the task related to entering a username in the username field, was abandoned. Although the user clicked on the "Restaurant Login" button and navigated to the login page, they did not complete the subsequent step of entering a username, which is a required field for login.

  1) [Step 1] The user visited the Restaurant's homepage.
  2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "Restaurant Login" link located at the top right corner of the page.
  3) [Step 3] Upon navigating to the login page, the user did not enter any data in the username field and did not perform any further actions related to the login process.

All the logs were considered in this decision making process. The user initiated the login task by clicking on the "Restaurant Login" link but did not complete it by entering a valid username, hence the classification of the session as a drop-off.
