   Reason: All initiated tasks in the session were completed. The user clicked on the "Restaurant Login" link (Step 1), navigated to the login page (Step 2), focused on the username input field (Step 3), entered their username (implicit, not logged), clicked the username input field to focus it (Step 4), and then typed in their password (implicit, not logged). After that, the user submitted the form to log in (Step 5). The final event in the session was a window resize, which is a common action and does not necessarily indicate abandonment.
