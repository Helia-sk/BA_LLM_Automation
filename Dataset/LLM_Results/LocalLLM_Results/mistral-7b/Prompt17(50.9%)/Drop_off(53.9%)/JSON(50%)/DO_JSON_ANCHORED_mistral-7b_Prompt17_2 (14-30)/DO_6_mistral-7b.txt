==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: Although the user initially interacted with the website and navigated through some pages, the user did not complete any of the initiated tasks. Specifically, they clicked on multiple links but did not proceed to login or order food, which were the two main actions initiated in this session.

1) The user first arrived at the homepage of the website (http://localhost:5173/).
2) The user scrolled down the homepage (Log 9 and Log 10).
3) The user clicked on a link to navigate to the login page (Log 11), but did not proceed to enter any login credentials.
4) The user returned to the homepage by clicking on the home button or navigating back in their browser history (not logged).
5) The user scrolled down the homepage again (Log 12).
6) The user clicked on another link to navigate to a different page, presumably a food ordering page (Log 13), but did not proceed with an order.
7) The user navigated back to the login page by clicking on the login button or following a direct link (not logged).
8) The user scrolled down the login page (Log 14).
9) The user clicked on another link to navigate away from the website (Log 15), effectively ending the session.

In this log file, all initiated tasks (logging in and ordering food) were abandoned, so the session was a drop-off.
