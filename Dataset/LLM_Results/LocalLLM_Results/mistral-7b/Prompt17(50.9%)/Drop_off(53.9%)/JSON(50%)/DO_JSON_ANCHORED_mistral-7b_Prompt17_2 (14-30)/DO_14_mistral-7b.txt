 Tag: Conversion

   Reason: The user initiated the task by clicking on the "Restaurant Login" link and followed by several interactions with the username and password fields, indicating that they were trying to log in. The user completed both tasks initiated by clicking on the "username" input field twice (one for debounced_input and one for click) and the "password" input field once (for debounced_input). These actions show that the user was actively engaging with the login process, which is an indication of a conversion.

   1) The user landed on the restaurant's login page by clicking on the "Restaurant Login" link.
   2) The user clicked on the username input field (debounced_input).
   3) The user clicked on the username input field again (click).
   4) The user clicked on the password input field (debounced_input).
   These interactions suggest that the user was attempting to log in, and since all initiated tasks were completed, it is classified as a conversion.
