 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user initiated tasks such as scrolling, clicking on a link, and navigating to the login page, but did not complete the task of logging in (which is indicated by the "Hungry?Order delicious food from local restaurants" click event). Since the user left the site without completing the intended action (logging in), it is considered a drop-off.

  1) [Step 1] The user accessed the homepage ("http://localhost:5173/") by scrolling down to view its content.
  2) [Step 2] The user scrolled back to the top of the page and clicked on a link, navigating to the login page ("http://localhost:5173/customer/login").
  3) [Step 3] The user scrolled down on the login page but did not fill out any form fields or submit the login request.
  4) [Step 4] The user then scrolls back up to the top of the page and clicks on a link ("Hungry?Order delicious food from local restaurants").
  5) [Step 5] The user leaves the site without taking any further action (indicated by no more log entries).

The user initiated tasks (scrolling, clicking, and navigating to the login page), but did not complete the intended action of logging in or ordering food. As a result, this session is considered a drop-off.
