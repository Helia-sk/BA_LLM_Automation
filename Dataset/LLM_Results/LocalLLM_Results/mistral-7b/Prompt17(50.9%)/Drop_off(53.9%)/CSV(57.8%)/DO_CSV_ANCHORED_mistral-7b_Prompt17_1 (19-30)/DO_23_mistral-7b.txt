==================================================

 Tag: Conversion
   Reason: The user initiated a task (clicking on the "Restaurant Partners" link) and completed another task (entering a username). Although there was an intermediate step where the user did not enter a password, this does not constitute abandonment because the user may have chosen to leave the password field blank or return to it later.

   User Journey:
   1) The user visited the restaurant's login page (/restaurant/login).
   2) The user clicked on the "Restaurant Partners" link, indicating an intention to register or log in.
   3) The user entered a username ("User1") into the username field.
   4) The user did not enter a password, but this does not signify abandonment as the user may return to complete this task later.
   5) (Not logged: no further steps indicating a successful login or registration were recorded in the provided logs.)
