 Tag: Conversion
   Reason: The user initiated the process by clicking on the link to the restaurant login/registration page (log_1757766042310_yw35kb4qd). Then, they clicked on the username input field (log_1757766043470_2t1rxjce0), entered their username "User1" twice, once for the debounced input event (log_1757766045214_ao35ysw1g) and once for the blur event (log_1757766045750_zvu4e95jm), and then clicked on the password input field (log_1757766045214_ao35ysw1g). Although they did not enter a password, they clicked on the login button, which is the final step to complete the login process. Since all initiated tasks were completed, this session can be classified as a conversion.
