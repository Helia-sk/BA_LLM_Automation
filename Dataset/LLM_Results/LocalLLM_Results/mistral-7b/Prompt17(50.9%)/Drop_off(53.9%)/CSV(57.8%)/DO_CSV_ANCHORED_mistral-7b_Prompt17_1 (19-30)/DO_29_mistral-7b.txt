 Tag: Conversion
   Reason: The user initiated a task (clicked on "Orders" link) and completed it by clicking on "Menu" and performing subsequent actions, which indicates a successful navigation to the desired page. No abandoned tasks were noted in the logs provided.

   User Journey Step-by-step:
   1) [Step 1] The user landed on the "/restaurant/dashboard" page (log_1758987129785_isoq16cd1).
   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "Orders" link (log_1758987129785_isoq16cd1), indicating an initiated task.
   3) [Step 3] The user clicked on the "Menu" link within the Orders page, indicating a successful navigation to the desired page (log_1758987131297_0umx0fp8a).
   4) [Step 4] The user performed subsequent actions within the Menu page, but no specific details were provided in the logs (log_1758987135508_qm6jpvl90 and following logs). However, since no abandoned tasks were noted, it can be assumed that the user continued interacting with the Menu page.

   The logs do not provide enough information to determine if any additional tasks were initiated or completed after Step 4. If further analysis reveals that all intended tasks were completed, then this session would indeed be a conversion. Otherwise, it may be classified as a drop-off if an intended task was abandoned.
