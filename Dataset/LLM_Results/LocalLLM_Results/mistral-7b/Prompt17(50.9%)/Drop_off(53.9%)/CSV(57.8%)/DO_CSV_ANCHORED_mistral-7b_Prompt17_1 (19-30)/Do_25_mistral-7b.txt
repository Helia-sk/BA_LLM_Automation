==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off

   Reason: The user initiated the task of logging into the restaurant system by clicking on "Restaurant Login", but did not complete subsequent tasks such as entering a username and password. This indicates that the user abandoned the session before completing all intended tasks, making it a drop-off.

   1) [Step 1] User navigated to the Restaurant Login page. (Log: log_1757766826727_nc9nu1zz0)
   2) [Step 2] User clicked on the "Restaurant Login" link to initiate the login process. (Log: log_1757766826727_nc9nu1zz0)
   3) [Step 3] User clicked on the username input field to begin entering their credentials. (Log: log_1757766827830_dlftq2kky)
   4) [Step 4] It appears that the user did not enter any data into the username input field and moved focus elsewhere, indicating that they may have intended to continue but decided against it. (No specific log for this action, inference based on subsequent events)
   5) [Step 5] The user did not click or interact with the password input field, suggesting that they did not intend to continue with the login process. (No log for this step as the user did not perform the action)
   6) [Step 6] The session was abandoned without completing the intended task of logging into the restaurant system. (No specific log for session abandonment, inference based on lack of subsequent actions)
