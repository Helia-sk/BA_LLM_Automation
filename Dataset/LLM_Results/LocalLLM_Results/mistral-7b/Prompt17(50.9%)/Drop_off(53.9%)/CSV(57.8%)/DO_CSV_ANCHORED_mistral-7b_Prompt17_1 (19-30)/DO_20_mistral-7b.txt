 Tag: Conversion

   Reason: The user initiated a click on the "Restaurant Login" button (log_1757766339479_qjji3gopf), followed by entering their username, and finally clicking on the username input field (log_1757766340749_80jvspqym). Although there are additional logs related to the username input, they do not indicate that the user abandoned the process since the username was eventually filled out.
