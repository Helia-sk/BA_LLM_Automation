 Tag: Conversion

   Reason: The user initiated and completed both the navigation to the login page (click on "Restaurant Login") and the subsequent input of username (twice, first using 'debounced_input' and then using 'click') and password fields.

   1) [Step 1] User navigated from the dashboard/menu page to the homepage by clicking on the "Restaurant Login" link.

   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the username input field to start typing their username.

   3) [Step 3] The user typed in their username using 'debounced_input' event and later confirmed the entry by clicking on the username input field again.

   4) [Step 4] The user clicked on the password input field to start typing their password.

   5) [Step 5] The user typed in their password using 'debounced_input' event and later confirmed the entry by clicking on the password input field again.

   6) [Step 6] As the user completed both username and password fields, they could have submitted the form to log in, but since there are no logs of a form submission, it is assumed that the user may have left the application after successful login or encountered an error. However, based on the available logs, the session can be considered as a conversion as all initiated tasks were completed.
