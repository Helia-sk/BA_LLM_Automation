 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: While the user has initiated several tasks, such as clicking on the "Customer Login" link and entering their username ("User1"), the session ends without the user completing the final step of entering a password. This indicates that the user did not complete the login process, which can be classified as a drop-off.

   Step-by-step User Journey:
   1) The user navigated to the customer login page (/customer/login).
   2) The user clicked on the "Customer Login" link.
   3) The user entered their username ("User1").
   4) The session ended without the user entering a password, indicating that the user did not complete the login process.
