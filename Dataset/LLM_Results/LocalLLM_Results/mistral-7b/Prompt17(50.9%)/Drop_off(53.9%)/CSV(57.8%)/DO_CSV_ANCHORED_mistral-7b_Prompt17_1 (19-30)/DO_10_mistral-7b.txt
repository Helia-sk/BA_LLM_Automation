 Tag: Drop-Off

   Reason: The user initiated a click on the "Customer Login" link, but it seems that no further interaction related to filling out the username and password fields was recorded. As the completion of these fields is an essential part of the login process, and since there's no evidence that this activity was carried out, we classify this session as a drop-off.

   1) The user visited the customer login page (/customer/login).
   2) The user clicked on the "Customer Login" link.
   3) No further interaction related to filling out the username and password fields was recorded, indicating an abandonment of the login process.
