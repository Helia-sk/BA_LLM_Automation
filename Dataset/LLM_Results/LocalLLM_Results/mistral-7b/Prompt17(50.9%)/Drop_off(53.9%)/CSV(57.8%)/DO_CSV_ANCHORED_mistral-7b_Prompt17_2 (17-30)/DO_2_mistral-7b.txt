==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: Although the user initiated two tasks (click events on "Restaurant Login" and "Customer Login"), they did not complete any of them as indicated by the absence of a subsequent event for those tasks. Instead, the user performed scroll actions on the homepage, which is likely an indication that the user was exploring but did not complete their intended action.

1) [Step 1] The user started a new session (session_1757763080934_tj3hw6dyl). They were using an anonymous browser with version web-1.4.2 and visited the homepage of the application.

2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "Restaurant Login" link (click event). However, no subsequent log indicates that they successfully entered their credentials or proceeded to another page.

3) [Step 3] The user clicked on the "Customer Login" link (click event). Similar to the previous step, there is no follow-up log indicating a successful login attempt for this task.

4) [Step 4] The user scrolled down the homepage (scroll event), which suggests that they were still engaging with the application but did not complete either of their intended tasks (login as a restaurant or customer).

5) [Step 5] The user again scrolled down the homepage (scroll event). This action, along with the previous scroll and click events, indicates that they were exploring the application further without completing their intended tasks.

The user did not complete any of the initiated tasks (Restaurant Login or Customer Login), so the session can be classified as a drop-off. The user journey could have potentially continued if the user had completed one or both of these tasks, but based on the available logs, it appears that they abandoned their intended actions and did not progress further in the application.
