==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: One of the initiated tasks (password input) was abandoned, as there is no subsequent log indicating a successful password submission or further progress towards account login. The user did not complete all the necessary steps to convert.

   User Journey Step-by-step:
   1) [Step 1] A new anonymous session (session_1757763080934_tj3hw6dyl) is initiated on the customer login page at http://localhost:5173/customer/login. The user's browser is Chrome version 140.0.0.0 with a screen resolution of 695x767.
   2) [Step 2] The user clicks on the username input field (click event).
   3) [Step 3] The user enters "dkjhf" as the value for the username input and blurs the field, triggering an input_change event.
   4) [Step 4] There is a delay before the user interacts with the password input field again (debounced_input event).
   5) [Step 5] The user clicks on the password input field but does not provide any value or submit it, which triggers another click event.
   Since the password submission was not completed, this session can be classified as a drop-off.
