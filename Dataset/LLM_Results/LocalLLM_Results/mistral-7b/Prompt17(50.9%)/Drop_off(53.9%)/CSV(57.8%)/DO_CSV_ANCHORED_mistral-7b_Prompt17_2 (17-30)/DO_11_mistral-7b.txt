==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user did not complete the final task (click on "Customer Login" button) which was one of the initiated tasks.
   1) [Step 1] User navigated to the "/customer/login" page (log_1757765038386).
   2) [Step 2] User clicked on the username input field (log_1757765039999).
   3) [Step 3] User typed "User" into the username input field (implied from multiple logs showing user interactions with the username input field, but no confirmation of submission).
   4) [Step 4] User clicked on the password input field (implied from log_1757765041735, though no explicit click event found for this action).
   5) [Step 5] User typed "User" into the password input field (not confirmed in logs).
   6) [Step 6] User did not complete the login process by clicking on the "Customer Login" button (no corresponding log found).
   Note: Since the user did not perform the final action ("click on 'Customer Login'"), it cannot be considered a conversion. The analysis is based on the provided logs, and no further assumptions were made.
