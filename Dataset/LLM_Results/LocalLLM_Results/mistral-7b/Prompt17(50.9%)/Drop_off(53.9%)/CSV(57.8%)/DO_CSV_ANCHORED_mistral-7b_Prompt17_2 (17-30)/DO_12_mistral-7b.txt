 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user initiated a session by navigating to the home page of the website, but did not complete any of the subsequent tasks such as scrolling down the page or clicking on the "LieferspatzRestaurant Login" link. Instead, the user clicked on the "Lieferspatz" logo and left the site. This indicates that the user did not engage in any of the intended actions (logging in or browsing further), hence classifying this session as a drop-off.

   User Journey:
   1) [Step 1] The user navigated to the home page of the website (http://localhost:5173/).
   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "Lieferspatz" logo, which is typically used for brand navigation or going back to a previous page. In this case, it appears the user left the site.
   This session does not show any evidence of completing other intended tasks, such as scrolling down the page or clicking on the "LieferspatzRestaurant Login" link, which indicates that the user did not engage in any of the intended actions, classifying this session as a drop-off.
