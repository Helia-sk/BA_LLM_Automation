2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "Restaurant Partners" link, indicating an intent to register or log in.
3) [Step 3] The user clicked on the username input field and started typing, indicating an intent to enter a username for registration or login.
4) [Step 4] The user entered a username ("User1"), completing the task of entering information into the username field.
5) [Step 5] (Assuming no subsequent logs indicate the user abandoning the session or not clicking the submit button) The user would complete the registration/login process, marking this as a conversion.
