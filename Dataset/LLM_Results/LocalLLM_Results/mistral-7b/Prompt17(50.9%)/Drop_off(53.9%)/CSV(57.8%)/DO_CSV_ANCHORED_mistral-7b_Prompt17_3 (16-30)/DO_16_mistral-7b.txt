==================================================

 Tag: Conversion

   Reason: The user initiated tasks (clicking on the username input field and typing in "User1") and completed the task by typing in "User1" twice, once for the debounced_input event and once for the click event. The password input field was not touched, so we can assume that the user did not intend to abandon the session.

   1) [Step 1] The user initiated a new session by accessing the "/restaurant/login" page.
   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the username input field.
   3) [Step 3] The user started typing "User" into the username input field.
   4) [Step 4] The user continued typing "1" to complete the username as "User1".
   5) [Step 5] The user clicked on the username input field again, which was likely an unintended action but still within the session.
   6) [Step 6] The user completed the username input by typing in "User1" again for the debounced_input event.
   7) [Step 7] Since no other actions were recorded, we can assume that the user successfully logged into the system or navigated away from the page, marking this as a conversion.
