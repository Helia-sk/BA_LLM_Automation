 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user scrolled through the homepage, clicked on a link to "customer/login", but did not perform any further actions that indicate completion of a task. This includes scrolling, clicking, or entering information in the login form. Since all initiated tasks (scrolling and clicking) were not completed, the session is considered a drop-off.

   2) The user scrolled through the homepage.
