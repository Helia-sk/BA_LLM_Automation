 Tag: Drop-Off

Reason: The user initiated the task of logging in by clicking on the "Log In" button, but did not complete the login process. Instead, they navigated away from the login page by clicking on the "Register your restaurant" link, indicating that they may have intended to create a new account instead. However, since they did not complete either the registration or the login process, this session can be classified as a drop-off.

1) [Step 1] The user navigated to the Restaurant Partners page at "http://localhost:5173/restaurant".
2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "Log In" button, initiating the login process.
3) [Step 3] The user entered their username ("User1") and clicked the username input field, indicating that they were typing in a value but no log was recorded for the password input field, suggesting that they did not enter a password.
4) [Step 4] The user clicked on the username input field again (likely to correct or edit their entry), initiating a "debounced_input" event.
5) [Step 5] The user navigated away from the login page by clicking on the "Register your restaurant" link, indicating that they may have intended to create a new account instead of logging in.
6) [Step 6] No further actions were recorded in the log file, suggesting that the user did not complete either the registration or the login process, and the session can be classified as a drop-off.
