==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user initiated a task (clicking on "Settings") but did not complete it, as no subsequent logs indicate any further interaction with the "Settings" page.

1) [Step 1] User accessed the restaurant dashboard page. (indicated by log_1758986823482_2vgj8ralk)
2) [Step 2] User clicked on the "History" link, navigating away from the dashboard to the history page. (indicated by log_1758986820537_d6ir4rjx3)
3) [Step 3] User returned to the dashboard page and clicked on the "Settings" link. (indicated by log_17589868226114_rc9p6rxb8, log_1758986823482_2vgj8ralk)
4) [Step 4] User interacted with the "Settings" page by selecting a day (log_1758986826114_rc9p6rxb8, log_1758986823482_2vgj8ralk). However, no subsequent logs show any further interaction with the "Settings" page or completion of a task, indicating that the user did not complete the session.

It is important to note that all initiated tasks were considered in this analysis. The user clicked on the links for both the "History" and "Settings" pages, but neither of these actions were completed (by clicking back to the dashboard or performing an action within those pages), thus classifying this as a drop-off.
