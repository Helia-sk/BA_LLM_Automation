 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user initiated a task (clicking on "Customer Login") but did not complete another subsequent task (entering a username and password). This indicates that the user did not go through with the login process, which is considered a drop-off.

Step 1: The user visited the customer login page at http://localhost:5173/customer/login.
Step 2: The user clicked on the "Customer Login" link.
Step 3: The user moved their cursor to the username input field but did not click or interact with it.
Step 4: The user moved their cursor to the password input field but did not click or interact with it.
Step 5: The user did not submit the login form, indicating that they either decided not to log in or encountered an issue and left the page, resulting in a drop-off.
