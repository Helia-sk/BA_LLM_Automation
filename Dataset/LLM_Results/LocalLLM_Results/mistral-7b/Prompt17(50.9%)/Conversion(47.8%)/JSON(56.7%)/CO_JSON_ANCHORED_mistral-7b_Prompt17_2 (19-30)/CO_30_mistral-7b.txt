==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: Although the user initially navigated to the History page, they did not complete any of the initiated tasks. Specifically, the user clicked on "View Details" but did not proceed further. Subsequently, the user clicked on the "History" link again, but still did not initiate or complete any other task in the session.

   Step 1: The user navigated to the Dashboard page. [Log with session_id: session_1758986435792_d7vaknpyz]

   Step 2: The user clicked on the "History" link within the Dashboard page. [Log with session_id: log_1758986443885_ebam3884s]

   Step 3: The user viewed the History page. [Log with session_id: log_1758986445667_767la5ed5]

   Step 4: The user clicked on the "View Details" button within the History page. [Log with session_id: log_1758986443885_ebam3884s]

   Step 5: The user clicked on the "History" link again, possibly to navigate back to the previous screen, but did not initiate or complete any other task. [Log with session_id: log_1758986435792_d7vaknpyz]

   Step 6: The user exited the application by navigating away from the History page. [No specific log for this step, but it can be inferred based on the absence of subsequent logs]
