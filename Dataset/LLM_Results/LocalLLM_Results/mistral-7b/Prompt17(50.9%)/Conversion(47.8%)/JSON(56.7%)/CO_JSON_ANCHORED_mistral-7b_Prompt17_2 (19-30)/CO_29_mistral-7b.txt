 Tag: Conversion
   Reason: The user initiated tasks "View Details" and "History", both of which were completed. This indicates that the user was engaged in using the application and completed the intended actions, demonstrating a conversion.

1) [Step 1] The user opened the webpage at "/restaurant/dashboard/history".
2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "X" button to close an element, indicating they may have been viewing details or content that was no longer needed.
3) [Step 3] The user then clicked on the link labeled "History" in the menu, which took them back to the history page.
4) [Step 4] The user initiated and completed the task of clicking on the button labeled "View Details". This action provided more information or details about an item within the history.
5) [Step 5] Finally, the user clicked on the link labeled "History" again, indicating they may have wanted to review their history after viewing the details. This action could be considered redundant as they were already on the history page, but it does not affect the conversion classification.

The logs provided in this case consider all initiated tasks and since all of them were completed, the session can be classified as a Conversion. The user was engaged in using the application and completed the intended actions.
