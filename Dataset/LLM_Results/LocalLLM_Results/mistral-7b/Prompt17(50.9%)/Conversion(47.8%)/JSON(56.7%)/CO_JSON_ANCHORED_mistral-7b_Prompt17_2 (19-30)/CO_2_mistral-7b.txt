 Tag: Conversion

   Reason: The user initiated the session by clicking on the "Customer Login" link, which is considered a task. After that, the user filled out the form with username, and it appears that they didn't leave the page (no click event for "Already have an account? Sign in" or navigation events). Instead, there is a subsequent input event for the username field, suggesting the user continued to interact with the form. Finally, there is no indication of the session being abandoned as the user clicked the button to submit the form (submit_trigger: click).

   User Journey step-by-step:
   1) The user clicked on the "Customer Login" link.
   2) The user navigated to the customer login page.
   3) The user clicked on the username input field.
   4) The user typed their username (though we don't have explicit confirmation of this in the logs, it is implied by the username_length being non-zero).
   5) The user didn't click on the "Already have an account? Sign in" link or navigate away from the page.
   6) The user clicked the submit button to send their username for login.
