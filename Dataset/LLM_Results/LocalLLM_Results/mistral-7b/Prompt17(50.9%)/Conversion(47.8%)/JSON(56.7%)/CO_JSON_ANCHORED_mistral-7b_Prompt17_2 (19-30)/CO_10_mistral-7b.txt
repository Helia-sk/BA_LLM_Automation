==================================================

 Tag: Conversion

   Reason: The user initiated a task (clicking on "Balance") and completed it, then went to another task (clicking on "Orders"), and also completed that task. Although they clicked on "View Details" for an order, that was not a required step for conversion as the primary goal of clicking on "Orders" was achieved.

   User Journey:
   1) [Step 1] The user started the session by visiting the customer dashboard (indicated by the first log with "Dashboard").
   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "Balance" link (log with id "log_1757774548389_g9ejp5srb"). This indicated that they wanted to check their balance.
   3) [Step 3] After checking their balance, the user decided to view their orders (indicated by clicking on "Orders", log with id "log_1757774552191_pe3hhyxl6").
   4) [Step 4] The user viewed their orders, and it appears they clicked on a specific order to view its details (indicated by clicking on "View Details", log with id "log_1757774553728_fcdp6kaj7").
   5) [Step 5] The user may have interacted further with the order details, but no such logs were provided. However, since they did not abandon the session (as evidenced by subsequent actions), it can be inferred that they possibly finished their interaction with the order details.
   The user then left the site or closed the browser, marking the end of the session. It's important to note that although no specific log indicated a "checkout" or "payment" action, the completion of tasks (balance check and order view) suggests that the user may have completed those actions off-screen or chose not to do so in this session.
