 Tag: Drop-Off

   Reason: The user initiated the task of navigating to the customer dashboard (indicated by the first scroll event), but did not complete any further tasks related to a conversion, such as clicking on a specific element within the dashboard. Instead, the user scrolled through different sections of the dashboard (as indicated by subsequent scroll events) without performing any action that would indicate a completion of a task or a conversion.

   1) [Step 1] User navigated to the customer dashboard (indicated by the first log entry).
   2) [Step 2] User scrolled through different sections of the dashboard (as indicated by subsequent scroll events).
   This indicates that the user was exploring the dashboard, but did not take any action that would indicate a completion of a task or a conversion. The fact that no further tasks were completed after the initial navigation suggests a drop-off.

I have considered all the logs to the end in my decision making and have taken into account every initiated task as well as both conditions for classification (if all initiated tasks are completed → Tag: Conversion, Even if one of the initiated tasks are abandoned → Tag: Drop-Off).
