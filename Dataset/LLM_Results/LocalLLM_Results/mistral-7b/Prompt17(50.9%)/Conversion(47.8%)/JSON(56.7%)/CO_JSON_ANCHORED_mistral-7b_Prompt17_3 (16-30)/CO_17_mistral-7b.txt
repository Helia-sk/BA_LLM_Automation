 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user initiated a task (clicking on "Restaurants" link) but did not complete it by visiting any of the restaurant pages. Instead, they visited the "No image available" div, scrolled down the page and then left the website (indicated by another scroll event with no further interactions).

  1) The user first landed on the dashboard page (/customer/dashboard).
  2) They clicked on the "Restaurants" link.
  3) Instead of visiting a restaurant page, they scrolled down the dashboard page and interacted with the "No image available" div.
  4) The user then scrolled down further on the dashboard page (indicating they might have been looking for something).
  5) Finally, there was another scroll event indicating the user left the website without any further interactions or visiting a restaurant page.
