 Tag: Conversion
   Reason: All the initiated tasks in this log file appear to be completed. The user initially scrolled on the homepage, clicked on a restaurant (indicating interest), scrolled again, clicked on an image within the restaurant's details page, scrolled once more, and finally left the page without any further interaction. However, since the last action could be considered normal if the user has completed their intended task (e.g., viewing the restaurant details), it is reasonable to assume a conversion in this case.

   User Journey:
   1) [Step 1] The user navigates to the homepage (scroll event).
   2) [Step 2] The user clicks on a restaurant link, indicating interest (click event).
   3) [Step 3] The user scrolls within the restaurant details page (scroll event).
   4) [Step 4] The user clicks on an image within the restaurant's details (click event).
   5) [Step 5] The user scrolled again within the same page (scroll event).
   6) [Step 6] The user leaves the page without any further interaction (no specific event recorded, but it's reasonable to assume they have completed their intended task).
