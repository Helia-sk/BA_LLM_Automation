 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user initiated the form submit event, but this was not followed by a successful form completion. Instead, the session ended with an "input_change" event on the password field (indicating the user stopped interacting with the form).

   User Journey Steps:
   1) [Step 1] The user navigated to the login page of the restaurant website.
   2) [Step 2] The user entered their username, but it seems that this is not recorded in the log file.
   3) [Step 3] The user entered a password and the system recorded this event as an "input_change" event on the password field. This suggests the user may have stopped interacting with the form at this point.
   4) [Step 4] No further interactions related to form submission or navigation were recorded, indicating that the session ended without a successful form completion (sign-in).
