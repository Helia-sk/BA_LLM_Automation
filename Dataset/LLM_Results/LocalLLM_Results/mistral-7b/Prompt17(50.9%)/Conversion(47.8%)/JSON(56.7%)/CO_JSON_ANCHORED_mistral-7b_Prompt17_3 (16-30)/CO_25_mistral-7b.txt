 Tag: Drop-Off

   Reason: The user initiated a click event on the "Menu" link but did not complete any other task that could be considered as a conversion. The user also performed a scroll event, but it is unclear if this was part of the intended interaction or not. However, since the user did not complete any subsequent tasks, we can conclude that this session was a drop-off.

   1) [Step 1] - User visited the restaurant dashboard page (URL: http://localhost:5173/restaurant/dashboard/menu).
   2) [Step 2] - User scrolled down the page (Event: scroll). This could be part of the user's exploration or navigation, but it is unclear if this was a deliberate action towards completing a task.
   3) [Step 3] - User clicked on the "Menu" link (Event: click). This could potentially indicate an intent to navigate to the menu section of the page. However, since no further tasks were completed, we can infer that the user did not find what they were looking for or decided to leave the page.

It is important to note that since all logs provided are related to frontend events and do not show any backend interactions or conversions, it is possible that additional information (such as form submissions or other server-side events) could change the classification of this session from a drop-off to a conversion. However, based on the information provided, we can only conclude that this was a drop-off session.
