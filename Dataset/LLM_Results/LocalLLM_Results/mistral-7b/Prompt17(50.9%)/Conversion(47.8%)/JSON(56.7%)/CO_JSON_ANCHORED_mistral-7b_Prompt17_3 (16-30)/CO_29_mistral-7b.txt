 Tag: Conversion

   Reason: All initiated tasks in this session are completed. The user started by clicking on the "History" link (Step 1), then clicked on the "View Details" button (Step 2), and finally closed the details view by clicking the "X" button (Step 3). After that, the user returned to the History page (Step 4) by clicking the "History" link again. The final action in the session was clicking the "Details" button for another history item (Step 5), which indicates a continuous engagement with the application, suggesting a conversion.

   1) User clicked on the "History" link (/restaurant/dashboard/history).
   2) User clicked on the "View Details" button for a specific history item.
   3) User closed the details view by clicking the "X" button.
