 Tag: Drop-Off

   Reason: The user initiated a task (clicking on the "Customer Login" link) but did not complete it by entering any username or password. This indicates that the user dropped off before completing the login process.

   1) [Step 1] User accessed the homepage (indicated by the first log entry).
   2) [Step 2] User clicked on the "Customer Login" link (4th log entry, identified by the tagName "A").
   3) [Step 3] User clicked on the username input field but did not enter any data (5th and 6th logs).
   4) [Step 4] User clicked on the password input field but did not enter any data (7th log).
   5) [Step 5] User clicked away from the login form without submitting it (8th log, identified by the tagName "INPUT" and click event).

After examining all logs, it appears that the user initiated a task (logging in) but did not complete it, making this a drop-off session.
