   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the username input field (log with id "log_1758982001809_u5d0yu5q9"). This suggests that the user intended to enter their credentials for login.
   3) [Step 3] The user then clicked on the password input field (log with id "log_1758982001809_sinkyvxay") indicating that they were entering their password.
   4) [Step 4] After entering their credentials, the user clicked on the username input field again (logs with ids "log_1758982003418_3owdv9ltz" and "log_1758982003418_3owdv9ltz") which suggests that they are likely focusing on the username field, possibly submitting the form.

   7) [Step 7] The user then clicked on the username input field (log with id "log_1758982003409_xqjr16t8y") which could indicate that they were waiting for a response or checking their entry again.
