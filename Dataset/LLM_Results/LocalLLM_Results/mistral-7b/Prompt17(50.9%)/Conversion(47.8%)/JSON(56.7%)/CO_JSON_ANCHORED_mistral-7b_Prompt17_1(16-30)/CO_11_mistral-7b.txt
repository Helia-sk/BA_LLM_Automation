 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user initiated a task (scrolling down on the dashboard page) but did not complete it, as indicated by multiple scroll events without any subsequent interaction that would indicate a completion of a task. After scrolling down to the restaurant list section, there is no evidence of any further activity such as clicking on a restaurant, entering an address, or making a reservation.

   User Journey:
   1) [Step 1] The user accessed the customer dashboard page (http://localhost:5173/customer/dashboard).
   2) [Step 2] The user scrolled down the page to view the list of restaurants.
   3) [Step 3] The user continued scrolling down, indicating potential interest in viewing more restaurant options but did not interact with any of them further.
   4) [Step 4] The user scrolled back up the page, suggesting they may have decided to leave the page without taking any action.
   5) [Step 5] The user left the dashboard page (http://localhost:5173/customer/dashboard).

   It is important to note that all logs were considered in this analysis. The user did not initiate or complete any tasks that would indicate a conversion, such as making a reservation at a restaurant. Therefore, the session was classified as a drop-off.
