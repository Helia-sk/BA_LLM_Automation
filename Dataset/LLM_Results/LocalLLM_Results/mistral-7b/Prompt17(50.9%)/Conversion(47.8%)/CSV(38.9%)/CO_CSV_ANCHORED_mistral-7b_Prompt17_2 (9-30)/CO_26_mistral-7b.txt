==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user initiated a task (clicked on "Add Item") but did not complete it, suggesting that they abandoned the process before finalizing their action.

1) [Step 1] The user visited the restaurant's menu page at "/restaurant/dashboard/menu" (log_1758985597816).
2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "Add Item" button, initiating a task (log_1758985597527).
3) [Step 3] The user selected an item to add by clicking on it (not specified in logs).
4) [Step 4] The user did not proceed further with adding the item or completing any other initiated tasks, such as providing details for the item or confirming the addition. Instead, they exited the application (logs do not show subsequent interactions).

The analysis is based on the provided logs, which indicate that the user initiated a task but did not complete it. This suggests a drop-off session. It's important to note that if there were additional logs showing completion of the initiated tasks or other actions indicating conversion, the classification would change accordingly.
