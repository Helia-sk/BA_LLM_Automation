==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user clicked on "Restaurants" in the navigation bar, which initiated a task (Step 1), but then moved to the restaurant detail page for restaurant/4 and did not complete any further actions on that page. The user scrolled the page but did not interact with any elements such as clicking on the image or other links, suggesting that they may have abandoned their interaction on that page (Step 2).
   1) [User lands on the customer dashboard] (this is implicit from the first log)
   2) [User clicks "Restaurants" in the navigation bar to initiate a task, navigating to the restaurants list] (Step 1)
   3) [User selects a restaurant from the list and lands on the restaurant detail page for restaurant/4] (Step 2)
   4) [User scrolls the page but does not interact with any elements suggesting they may have abandoned their interaction on that page] (Step 3)
   It's important to note that the user did scroll the restaurant detail page, which suggests some level of engagement, but no further actions were taken. Therefore, based on the provided logs, the session can be classified as a drop-off since one of the initiated tasks was abandoned.
