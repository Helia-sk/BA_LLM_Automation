 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user initiated a login session, filled in the username field, but did not provide any password input. This indicates that the user did not complete the login process, which is one of the initiated tasks. Since all initiated tasks were not completed, the session is classified as a drop-off.

1) [Step 1] The user navigated to the restaurant's login page (/restaurant/login).
2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "Sign In" button.

4) [Step 4] The user blurred (lost focus) from the password field, triggering an 'input_change' event, but no password was entered.
5) [Step 5] No further interaction related to login or other tasks was recorded in the logs, indicating that the user did not complete any of the initiated tasks and abandoned the session.
