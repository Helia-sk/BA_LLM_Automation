 Tag: Conversion
   Reason: All initiated tasks were completed. The user first navigated to the dashboard (log_1757774276450_fntdti8qo), then scrolled down multiple times indicating navigation through the page (logs from log_1757774275386_7sjdieux2, log_1757774274528_gt98ftf43). At some point, the user clicked on a link to a specific restaurant page (log_1757774312977_t3pr9ygao), which is an initiated task. Later, the user performed multiple scrolls and clicks within that restaurant page before finally clicking on another button labelled "No image available" (log_1757774312977_t3pr9ygao). This action suggests that the user took some sort of action on the page, completing all initiated tasks.

   User Journey:
   1) The user navigated to the dashboard (/customer/dashboard) and scrolled through the page (log_1757774276450_fntdti8qo).
   2) The user continued scrolling down the dashboard, reaching different sections of the page (logs from log_1757774275386_7sjdieux2 and log_1757774274528_gt98ftf43).
   3) The user clicked on a link to navigate to a specific restaurant page (/customer/dashboard/restaurant/2) (log_1757774312977_t3pr9ygao).
   4) The user continued interacting with the restaurant page, scrolling and clicking on various elements (logs from log_1757774312977_t3pr9ygao, not specified as it includes multiple actions).
   5) The user clicked on an element labeled "No image available" on the restaurant page (log_1757774312977_t3pr9ygao), which could be a call-to-action or another initiated task, completing all tasks in this session.
