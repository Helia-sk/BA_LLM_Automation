 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: One of the initiated tasks (View Details in the dashboard history section) was abandoned, which indicates that the user did not complete all the actions they started.

1) [Step 1] - The user navigated to the restaurant dashboard page (`/restaurant/dashboard`) from an unknown referrer with browser version web-1.4.2 at time 2025-09-27T15:20:35.792Z.
2) [Step 2] - The user clicked on the "History" link located at x=676, y=126 to navigate to the history section of the dashboard page.
3) [Step 3] - The user then clicked on the "View Details" button for a specific order in the history section, initiating the task of viewing details.
4) [Step 4] - However, the log shows that the user abandoned this initiated task by clicking the "X" button to close the details modal, which indicates a drop-off.
5) [Step 5] - The user navigated away from the history section and went back to the dashboard page without any further interaction.

In this scenario, the user did not complete all the actions they started (View Details), so the session is classified as a drop-off. It's essential to consider all the logs to make an informed decision about user behavior in the application.
