 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user performed the initial click on the "Restaurant Login" link, but did not complete the login process. However, the user continued to interact with the page by clicking on the "Already have an account? Sign in" button and then moved the cursor over the "Sign in" link without performing a click, indicating that they might be exploring different options or having second thoughts about completing the login. The session was not considered a conversion because the user did not complete the login task, which is one of the initiated tasks that should have been completed for it to be classified as a conversion.

  1) [Step 1] The user navigated to the restaurant login page by clicking on the "Restaurant Login" link.
  2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "Already have an account? Sign in" button, which might indicate they were considering the possibility of signing up instead.
  3) [Step 3] The user moved the cursor over the "Sign in" link without clicking, suggesting they might be exploring other options or reconsidering their decision to sign in.
  4) [Step 4] The session ended without the user performing a click on the username input field, which is where the login process would typically start. This indicates that the user did not proceed with the login, making it a drop-off session.
