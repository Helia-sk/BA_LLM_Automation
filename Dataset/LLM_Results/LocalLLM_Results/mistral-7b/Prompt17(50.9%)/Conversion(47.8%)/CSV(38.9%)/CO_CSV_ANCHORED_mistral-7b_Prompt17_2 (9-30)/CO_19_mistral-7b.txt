==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off

   Reason: The user clicked on the "Customer Login" button, which indicates an initiated task. However, further logs show that after clicking the "Customer Login" button, no subsequent logs related to completing the login process were found. This suggests that the user may have abandoned the site without completing the login process.

   1) [Step 1] The user navigated to the homepage (URL: http://localhost:5173/).
   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "Customer Login" button located at x:1659, y:19.
   3) [Step 3] The user clicked on the username input field but no subsequent logs related to entering a username were found.
   4) [Step 4] The user clicked on the password input field but no subsequent logs related to entering a password were found.
   5) [Step 5] No further logs related to clicking the login button or any other actions that would indicate completion of the login process were found.

   It is important to note that all logs were reviewed and no subsequent logs indicating completion of the login process were found. However, it is always possible that there may be additional logs not included in this dataset that could change the classification from Drop-Off to Conversion if the user completed the login process after these logs ended.
