 Tag: Conversion

   Reason: The user initiated a task (clicking on "Restaurants") and completed it by navigating to the "/customer/dashboard/restaurant" page, and then interacted with multiple elements on that page, indicating engagement. Subsequently, the user entered the "/customer/dashboard/restaurant/9" page and performed a scroll event, which is typically an indication of continued exploration or interaction. Finally, the user interacted with elements on the "/customer/dashboard/restaurant/9" page again, which shows further engagement before leaving the site (as indicated by the "/customer/dashboard/cart" and "/customer/dashboard" navigation).

   1) The user started the session on the homepage ("/customer/dashboard").
   2) Clicked on the "Restaurants" link to navigate to the restaurants page.
   3) Navigated further to the specific restaurant page (/"customer/dashboard/restaurant/9").
   4) Scrolled through the page and interacted with its elements, indicating continued engagement.
   5) Interacted with more elements on the same page, possibly exploring or considering a purchase.
   6) Navigated away from the restaurant page to the cart page (/"customer/dashboard/cart") before finally leaving the site (/"customer/dashboard").
