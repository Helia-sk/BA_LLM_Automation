 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: Although the user initiated the login process by entering a username, they did not complete the subsequent tasks such as entering a password and submitting the form. The user also clicked on the "Register your restaurant" link, indicating potential interest in registering instead of logging in, which was not followed through.

  1) [Step 1] The user navigated to the login page (/restaurant/login).
  2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the username input field and initiated a click event.
  3) [Step 3] The user entered "User1" as the username and triggered a blur event.
  4) [Step 4] The user did not enter a password or click the submit button, indicating an abandonment of the login process.
  5) [Step 5] The user clicked on the "Register your restaurant" link, potentially showing interest in registering instead of logging in.
  6) [Step 6] No further interactions were recorded after the click on the "Register your restaurant" link, suggesting that the user did not proceed with registration either.

The user's session ended without completing any initiated tasks (login or registration), making it a drop-off session. It is essential to analyze all available logs to ensure a comprehensive understanding of the user's behavior and make an informed decision.
