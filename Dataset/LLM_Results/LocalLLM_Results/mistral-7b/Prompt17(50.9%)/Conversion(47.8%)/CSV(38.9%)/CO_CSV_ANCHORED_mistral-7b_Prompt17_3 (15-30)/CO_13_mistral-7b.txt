==================================================

 Tag: Conversion
   Reason: All initiated tasks were completed. The user made a request to /api/orders/21/complete, and then a subsequent request to /api/orders/21/details, indicating that they have successfully completed an order and then viewed its details. There are no logs showing any abandoned tasks.

   User Journey:
   1) The user initiated a session with an anonymous ID (session_id).
   2) The user made a request to the backend server for the orders history page (/api/orders/).
   3) The user selected a specific order (order 21), and made a request to view its details by navigating to /api/orders/21/details.
   4) The user completed the order by making a request to /api/orders/21/complete.
   5) The user then viewed the details of the completed order again, indicating that they have successfully processed and are satisfied with their transaction.
   It is important to note that all the logs were from the backend server, so we do not have visibility into any frontend interactions beyond what was logged. However, the sequence of requests indicates a successful transaction and subsequent review of details, which aligns with a conversion event.
