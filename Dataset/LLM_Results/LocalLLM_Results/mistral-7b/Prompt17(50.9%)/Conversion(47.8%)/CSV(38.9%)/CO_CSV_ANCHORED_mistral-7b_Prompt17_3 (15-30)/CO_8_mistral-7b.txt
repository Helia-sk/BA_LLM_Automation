==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: Although the user initiated the click on the "Customer Login" link, they did not complete any other tasks such as entering their username or password. This indicates that the user dropped off before completing the intended task.

1) [Step 1] The user opened the customer login page at http://localhost:5173/customer/login.
2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "Username" div, possibly to start typing their username. However, no username input was detected in the logs.
3) [Step 3] The user clicked on the "Username" div again, which could indicate that they were trying to interact with the field but did not succeed. No further actions were detected in the logs.
4) [Step 4] The user did not click on or interact with any other elements on the page, indicating that they did not proceed with the login process.
5) [Step 5] The session ended without any indication of a successful login attempt.

The analysis is based on the logs provided, and it seems that all initiated tasks were abandoned, which classifies this as a drop-off. The user journey outlines the steps taken by the user on the customer login page but does not show completion of the intended task (login).
