 Tag: Conversion
   Reason: All initiated tasks in the log file were completed. The user initially landed on the dashboard page (/customer/dashboard), scrolled through it, and then navigated to a specific restaurant page (/customer/dashboard/restaurant/2). After scrolling on that particular restaurant page, the user clicked on an image, indicating they were interested in viewing more information. Finally, the user clicked on a "No image available" span element which could indicate they wanted to upload their own image or report an issue with the image. Since all these actions were completed, we can classify this session as a conversion.

   User Journey:
   1) The user landed on the dashboard page (/customer/dashboard).
   2) The user scrolled through the dashboard content.
   3) The user navigated to a specific restaurant page (/customer/dashboard/restaurant/2).
   4) The user scrolled through the content on the specific restaurant page.
   5) The user clicked on an image, indicating they were interested in viewing more information about the restaurant.
   6) The user clicked on a "No image available" span element, potentially to upload their own image or report an issue with the existing one. This could also indicate that they were unable to view the image for some reason.
