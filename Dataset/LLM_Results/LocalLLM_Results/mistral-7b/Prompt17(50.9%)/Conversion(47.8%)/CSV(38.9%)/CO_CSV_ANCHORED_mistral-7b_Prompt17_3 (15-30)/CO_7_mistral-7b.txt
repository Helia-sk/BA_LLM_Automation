 Tag: Drop-Off

   Reason: The user initiated a click on the "Customer Login" link, but no further actions related to filling out the username and password form were recorded. Since completing these tasks is essential for a conversion, the session can be classified as a drop-off.

   1) [Step 1] User accessed the customer login page at http://localhost:5173/customer/login.
   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "Customer Login" link (indicated by click.v1 event).
   3) [Step 3] The user clicked on the username input field, but no further input_change events were recorded, suggesting that the user did not enter a username.
   4) [Step 4] The user clicked on the password input field, but no further input_change events were recorded, suggesting that the user did not enter a password.
   5) [Step 5] No submit event was recorded, indicating that the user did not attempt to log in.

   It is important to note that all initiated tasks (clicking on the username and password fields) were completed, but one of the essential tasks for conversion - entering login credentials and submitting the form - was abandoned, which leads to classifying this session as a drop-off.
