   Reason: The user initiated the task of logging in, but did not complete it. This is evident as there is a log entry for clicking on the "Username" field and entering "User1", however, there are no subsequent log entries indicating that the user entered a password or clicked on the "Sign In" button.

   User Journey:
   1) The user navigated to the login page.
   2) The user clicked on the "Username" field.
   3) The user entered "User1" into the "Username" field.
   4) No subsequent actions were taken, indicating that the user did not enter a password or click on the "Sign In" button, thus abandoning the login process.
