 Tag: Drop-Off

   Reason: The user initiated a click event on the "Customer Login" button, but no subsequent logs indicate that they completed the login process. The login process would typically include entering a username and password, which are not seen in the provided logs. Since one of the initiated tasks (login) was abandoned, the session is classified as a drop-off.

   1) [Step 1] The user navigated to the homepage (/).
   2) [Step 2] The user scrolled down the page.
   3) [Step 3] The user clicked on the "Customer Login" button, indicating they wanted to start a login session.
   4) [Step 4] No further logs indicate that the user entered their username and password or completed the login process. This is consistent with a drop-off scenario where the user did not proceed with the intended action.
