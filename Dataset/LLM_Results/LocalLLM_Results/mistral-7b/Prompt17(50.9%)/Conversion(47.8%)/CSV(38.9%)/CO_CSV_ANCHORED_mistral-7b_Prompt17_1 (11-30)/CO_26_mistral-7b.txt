 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The initiated task of adding an item was not completed, suggesting that the user did not proceed to checkout.

   1) [Step 1] User navigated to the restaurant menu page (/restaurant/dashboard/menu).
   2) [Step 2] User clicked on the "Add Item" button.
   3) [Step 3] User selected an item from the list of menu items (Menu Items, All Items, Starters, Main Courses, Desserts, Drinks, Side Dishes). However, no log indicates that the user actually added an item to their cart or proceeded to checkout.
   4) [Step 4] User clicked on the "Drag image here or click to upload" area, possibly to add an image for the selected item, but no further logs indicate that an image was successfully uploaded.
   5) [Step 5] User did not interact with any other elements on the page that could be considered part of the checkout process or completing a transaction, such as clicking "Proceed to Checkout" or "Add to Cart".

The user initiated the task of adding an item to their cart but did not complete it, so we classify this session as a drop-off. The user journey ended at step 4 with no further interaction suggesting a potential abandonment of the checkout process.
