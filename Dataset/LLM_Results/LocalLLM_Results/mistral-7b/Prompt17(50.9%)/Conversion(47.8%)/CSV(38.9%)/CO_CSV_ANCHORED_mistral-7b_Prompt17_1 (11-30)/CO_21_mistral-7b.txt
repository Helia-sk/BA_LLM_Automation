 Tag: Conversion
   Reason: The user initiated a task (navigating to /restaurant/login page) and completed it by providing a username ("User1") and then clicked on a button, which implies a login attempt. Although the password input is missing in the log file, we cannot confirm if the login was successful or not, but since no other abandoned tasks are observed, it is safe to assume that this session resulted in a conversion.

   User Journey Step-by-step:
   1) [Step 1] The user navigated to the homepage (http://localhost:5173/) from another page (/restaurant/dashboard).
   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on a link that read "Restaurant PartnersRegister your restaurant or log in to manage orders", which led them to the /restaurant/login page.
   3) [Step 3] On the /restaurant/login page, the user entered their username ("User1") in the username input field.
   4) [Step 4] The user either successfully logged in or encountered an error (log file does not indicate this), but since no further abandoned tasks were observed, it is assumed that the login was successful and the session resulted in a conversion.
