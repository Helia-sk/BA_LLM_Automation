==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user initiated a task (clicking on "History" link in the dashboard) but did not complete it by clicking on the specific order details. Instead, they navigated away from the history page and moved to another part of the application (dashboard/history -> dashboard). This indicates that the user abandoned one of the initiated tasks, making this a drop-off session.

  1) [Step 1] User started a new session with version web-1.4.2 (log_1758986435792_vg05snfan).
  2) [Step 2] User navigated to the restaurant dashboard page (/restaurant/dashboard, log_1758986435792_vg05snfan).
  3) [Step 3] User clicked on the "History" link in the dashboard (log_1758986443885_ebam3884s).
  4) [Step 4] User viewed the history page without clicking on any specific order details (no corresponding log found).
  5) [Step 5] User clicked on the "X" button to navigate away from the history page and return to the dashboard (log_1758986445667_767la5ed5).
  6) [Step 6] User remained on the dashboard without initiating any further tasks (no corresponding logs found), suggesting that the session ended.
   It is important to consider all logs in the analysis, as each log provides a snapshot of user activity within the session. The absence of specific logs may indicate that certain tasks were not completed or initiated by the user. In this case, the lack of a log for clicking on an order detail suggests that the user abandoned the task of viewing specific order details.
