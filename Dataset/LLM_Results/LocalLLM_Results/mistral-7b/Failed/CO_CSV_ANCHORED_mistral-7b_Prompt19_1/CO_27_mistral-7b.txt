Prompt: Analyze the log file. For each required core event
(Login, Registration, Add Item, Modify Cart, Place Order, etc.),
check if it was explicitly completed in the logs.
Mark each event as True (completed) or False (not completed).
==================================================

1. Login: False (There is no 'login' event in the provided log file)
2. Registration: False (There is no 'registration' event in the provided log file)
3. Add Item: False (There is no 'add_item' event in the provided log file)
4. Modify Cart: False (There is no 'modify_cart' event in the provided log file)
5. Place Order: False (There is no 'place_order' event in the provided log file)
6. Any other specific events (like clicking on buttons or navigating to pages etc.) are not explicitly labeled as such, but we can consider them as 'interaction' since they interact with the application. So, True for each interaction event.
