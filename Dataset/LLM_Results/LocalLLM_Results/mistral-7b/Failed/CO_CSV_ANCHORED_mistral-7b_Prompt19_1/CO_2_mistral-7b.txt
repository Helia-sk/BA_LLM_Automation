Prompt: Analyze the log file. For each required core event
(Login, Registration, Add Item, Modify Cart, Place Order, etc.),
check if it was explicitly completed in the logs.
Mark each event as True (completed) or False (not completed).
==================================================

1. Login: True (The user has clicked on the "Customer Login" button)
2. Registration: False (There is no evidence of registration events in the log file)
3. Add Item: False (There is no evidence of "Add Item" events in the log file)
4. Modify Cart: False (There is no evidence of "Modify Cart" events in the log file)
5. Place Order: False (There is no evidence of "Place Order" events in the log file)
6. Other potential events (like Sign Up, Forgot Password, etc.) would require additional context and information not provided in this log file to determine if they were completed or not.
