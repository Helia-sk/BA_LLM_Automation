Prompt: Analyze the log file. For each required core event
(Login, Registration, Add Item, Modify Cart, Place Order, etc.),
check if it was explicitly completed in the logs.
Mark each event as True (completed) or False (not completed).
==================================================

1. Login: True - The log file shows a "click" event on the "Customer Login" button at timestamp 2025-09-27T14:11:39.417Z, which suggests that the user has logged in.

2. Registration: False - There is no explicit evidence of registration in the provided log file.

3. Add Item: Not Applicable - The logs do not show any "Add Item" events as they are related to interactive actions on a product page, which is not included in this log.

4. Modify Cart: Not Applicable - Similar to the "Add Item", there is no evidence of cart modification in the provided log file.

5. Place Order: Not Applicable - There is no "Place Order" event in the logs, which suggests that placing an order was not performed during this session.

6. Other events like Search, Navigation, etc., can be marked as True based on the corresponding events found in the log file. For example:
   - Search: True - There is a "click" event on the search bar at timestamp 2025-09-27T14:11:39.417Z, indicating a search was performed.
   - Navigation: True - The first log shows a "page_view" event at timestamp 2025-09-27T14:11:22.530Z, which suggests that navigation occurred during the session.
