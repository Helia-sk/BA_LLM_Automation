Prompt: Analyze the log file. For each required core event
(Login, Registration, Add Item, Modify Cart, Place Order, etc.),
check if it was explicitly completed in the logs.
Mark each event as True (completed) or False (not completed).
==================================================

1. Login: True - The first few log entries show a sequence of clicking on the "Customer Login" button and filling out the username input field, so it appears that a login has been successfully completed.

2. Registration: False - There is no evidence in the logs to suggest that a registration event has occurred. No entries show any form submission related to registration.

3. Add Item: Not Applicable - The logs do not contain enough information to determine if an item was added to the cart, as they only show user interactions with the login page and no further interactions are documented in this log snippet.

4. Modify Cart: Not Applicable - As above, there is insufficient information available to determine if a user modified their cart.

5. Place Order: Not Applicable - Similarly, without additional context or logs documenting the order placement process, it cannot be determined whether an order was placed in this session.
