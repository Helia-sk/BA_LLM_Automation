Prompt: Analyze the log file. For each required core event
(Login, Registration, Add Item, Modify Cart, Place Order, etc.),
check if it was explicitly completed in the logs.
Mark each event as True (completed) or False (not completed).
==================================================

1. Login: False - No login event is present in the log file.
2. Registration: False - No registration event is present in the log file.
3. Add Item: Not applicable since this is a client-side only application, so no items can be added without server interaction.
4. Modify Cart: Not applicable as per the same reason as above.
5. Place Order: Not applicable as per the same reason as above.
6. Logout: Not applicable as there's no logout event in the logs and this application is single-session.
