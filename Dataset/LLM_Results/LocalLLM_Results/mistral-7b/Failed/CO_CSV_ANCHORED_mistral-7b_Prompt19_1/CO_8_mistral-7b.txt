Prompt: Analyze the log file. For each required core event
(Login, Registration, Add Item, Modify Cart, Place Order, etc.),
check if it was explicitly completed in the logs.
Mark each event as True (completed) or False (not completed).
==================================================

1. Login: True (The log contains a click event on "Customer Login" which is likely to lead to login)
2. Registration: False (There's no explicit registration event in the provided logs)
3. Add Item: Not Determined (We don't have any 'Add Item' events in the given logs, so we cannot confirm if it was completed or not)
4. Modify Cart: Not Determined (Similar to the 'Add Item', we don't have any 'Modify Cart' events in the provided logs)
5. Place Order: Not Determined (There's no explicit 'Place Order' event in the given logs, so we cannot confirm if it was completed or not)
6. Other potential events like 'View Product', 'Search Product', etc., are also not present in the logs, so they would be marked as Not Determined.
