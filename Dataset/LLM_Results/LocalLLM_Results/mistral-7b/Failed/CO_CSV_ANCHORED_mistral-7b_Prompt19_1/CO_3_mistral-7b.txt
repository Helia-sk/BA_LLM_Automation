Model used: mistral:7b
Prompt: Analyze the log file. For each required core event
(Login, Registration, Add Item, Modify Cart, Place Order, etc.),
check if it was explicitly completed in the logs.
Mark each event as True (completed) or False (not completed).
==================================================

1. Login: True - The logs show a user navigating to the "/restaurant/login" page and clicking on the "Restaurant Login" link, followed by clicking on the username input field and then the password input field. However, there is no evidence of the user submitting their login credentials or being successfully logged in.

2. Registration: False - There is no indication in the logs that a registration event was initiated or completed.

3. Add Item: False - The logs do not show any events related to adding an item to the cart.

4. Modify Cart: False - Similarly, there are no log entries indicating that a user has modified their cart.

5. Place Order: False - There is no evidence in the logs that a user placed an order.

6. Other potential events (e.g., Search, View Product, etc.):
   - Search: It appears that the user navigated to the login page and clicked on a link, but there's no indication of a search event being performed. So, we can mark it as False for now.
   - View Product: Also, there are no log entries suggesting that the user viewed any product or products. Therefore, we can mark it as False.
