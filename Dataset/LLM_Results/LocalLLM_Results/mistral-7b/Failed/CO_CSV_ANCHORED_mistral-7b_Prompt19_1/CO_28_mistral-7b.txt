Prompt: Analyze the log file. For each required core event
(Login, Registration, Add Item, Modify Cart, Place Order, etc.),
check if it was explicitly completed in the logs.
Mark each event as True (completed) or False (not completed).
==================================================

1. Login: The logs show a form submit event for "/restaurant/login" and a click event on the "Sign In" button. However, there is no evidence of a successful login (e.g., a subsequent event like "/restaurant/dashboard"), so I would mark it as False (not completed).

  2. Registration: There is no explicit log entry suggesting registration was attempted or completed, so I would mark it as False (not completed).

  3. Add Item: Since there are no logs related to adding an item to the cart, I would mark this event as False (not completed).

  4. Modify Cart: Similar to "Add Item", there are no logs suggesting a modification of the cart, so I would mark it as False (not completed).

  5. Place Order: As with the previous events, there is no evidence in the logs of a place order event being executed, so I would mark it as False (not completed).

  6. Other possible core events like Viewing Menu, Searching for Items, etc., are also not present in the provided log file. Thus, they should be marked as False (not completed) as well.
