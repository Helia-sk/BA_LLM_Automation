Prompt: Analyze the log file. For each required core event
(Login, Registration, Add Item, Modify Cart, Place Order, etc.),
check if it was explicitly completed in the logs.
Mark each event as True (completed) or False (not completed).
==================================================

1. Login: True (The first entry in the log shows a user navigating to "/customer/login" and then clicking the "Customer Login" button, indicating a successful login.)

2. Registration: False (There is no evidence of a registration event in the provided logs.)

3. Add Item: False (No entries indicate that an item was added to the cart.)

4. Modify Cart: False (Similarly, there are no entries suggesting that a user modified their cart.)

5. Place Order: False (The log does not show any indication of a place order event.)
