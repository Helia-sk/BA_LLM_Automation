Prompt: Analyze the log file. For each required core event
(Login, Registration, Add Item, Modify Cart, Place Order, etc.),
check if it was explicitly completed in the logs.
Mark each event as True (completed) or False (not completed).
==================================================

1. Login: True - The log shows a "Customer Login" event with a timestamp and other details, indicating that the login event has been completed.

2. Registration: False - There is no explicit registration event in the logs.

3. Add Item: False - There is no explicit "Add Item" event in the logs. However, if we consider the scroll events as a user potentially browsing and finding an item to add, it could be possible but not confirmed.

4. Modify Cart: False - There is no explicit "Modify Cart" event in the logs. Similarly, like the Add Item event, the scroll events might suggest that a user could modify their cart, but there is no confirmation of this action.

5. Place Order: False - There is no explicit "Place Order" event in the logs. Again, considering the scroll events as potential user actions, it's possible that a user may have placed an order, but there is no confirmation of this action.
