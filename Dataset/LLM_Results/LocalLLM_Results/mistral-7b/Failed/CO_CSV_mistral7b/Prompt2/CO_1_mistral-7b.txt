==================================================

 Based on the logs, it appears that a user has navigated to the Customer Login page of a web application and interacted with its elements. Here's a summary of the actions:

1. A user visited the Customer Login page (http://localhost:5173/customer/login).
2. The user clicked on the "Customer Login" link.
3. The user then clicked on the username input field, followed by entering the value "User1".
4. After that, the user clicked on the password input field, but no input was recorded for the password.
5. Subsequently, the user clicked on the username input field again (most likely to correct or edit the entered value), followed by entering the same value "User1" once more.
6. The user did not enter a password this time and proceeded to click on the "Sign In" button (as no log for password entry was found).
7. Lastly, the user clicked on the "Sign In" button but no response or further logs were recorded, indicating that either there was an error in the sign-in process or additional information about the outcome is missing from the provided logs.

To troubleshoot this issue, it would be helpful to have more context about the application and the expected behavior when a user attempts to sign in with invalid credentials. Additionally, further investigation into potential errors or issues that may have occurred during the sign-in process could provide insights on what went wrong.
