==================================================

 This appears to be a series of logs from a web application, with each log entry containing metadata and data about an event that occurred on the application. The events include clicks, scrolls, and navigation between pages.

For example, the first entry indicates that an event of type "scroll" occurred at 2025-09-13T14:32:57.591Z, during which the user scrolled on the "/customer/dashboard" page. The application version is "web-1.4.2", and the user agent is "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/140.0.0.0 Safari/537.36".

Similarly, the second entry shows that a click event occurred at 2025-09-13T14:32:58.615Z on the "/customer/dashboard/restaurant/4" page, triggered by an element with the class "w-full h-48 bg-gray-200 flex items-center justify-center".

These logs could be used for analyzing user behavior, optimizing the application's performance, and identifying potential issues or bugs.
