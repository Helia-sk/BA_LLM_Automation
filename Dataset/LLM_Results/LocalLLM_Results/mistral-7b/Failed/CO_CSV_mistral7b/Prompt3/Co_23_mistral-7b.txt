==================================================

 It appears you've provided a set of logs for frontend events on a web application. Each log represents an event that occurred in the application, such as a click or input change. Here is a summary of some of the events:

- A user clicked on the "Settings" option (log_1758985242334_sdckpcitq)
- The user navigated to the dashboard settings page (/restaurant/dashboard/settings)
- The user interacted with a DIV element (log_1758985244978_iwp6mwb31) and an A tag (log_1758985242334_sdckpcitq), presumably to open the settings section.
- The user clicked on an "Add" button (log_1758985244978_iwp6mwb31) and an INPUT element (log_1758985245310_oskul68ek). It seems like the user might be trying to add something in the dashboard settings.
- The user interacted with an INPUT field (log_1758985245310_oskul68ek) and then blurred it (log_1758985250359_qdfuhfqg7). This suggests that the user entered a value into the field.
- The user clicked on an INPUT element (log_1758985250419_r6kpzxk5o) and then blurred it (log_1758985253753_f8njg9cjm). It seems like the user entered another value into another field.
- The user clicked on an "Add" button (log_1758985250468_aqzxv6b8l) and then blurred it (log_1758985253848_c6m4njcmm). It looks like the user submitted some information after filling out the fields.
- Finally, the user clicked on a button labeled "Save" (log_1758985253955_b1yjlzjqo) and then blurred it (log_1758985254009_gqn6vqc6r). It seems like the user saved their changes in the dashboard settings.
