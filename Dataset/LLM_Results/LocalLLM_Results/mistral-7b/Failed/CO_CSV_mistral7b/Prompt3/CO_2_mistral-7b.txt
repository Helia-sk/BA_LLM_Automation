==================================================

 This log shows a series of events in a user session on a web application, specifically the Customer Login page. The events are logged using the `log_*` function and each event contains metadata such as the timestamp, source (frontend), session ID, user agent information, etc.

   Here's a breakdown of the events in the log:

   1. The user clicks on the "Customer Login" link (`click.v1`). This could be the main navigation item leading to the Customer Login page.

   2. After landing on the Customer Login page, the user clicks on a login form field (possibly the username input field) with `id="username"` (`click.v1`).

   3. The user then enters their username by typing something into the input field, which triggers the `input_change.v1` event twice as they modify the input value (from "user" to "user1", and then to "user2").

   4. The user clicks on the "Already have an account? Sign in" link, which could lead to a registration or password recovery page (`click.v1`).

   5. The user goes back to the Customer Login page (possibly by clicking the back button or using the URL directly), clicks on the login form field again, and then enters their updated username ("user2").

   6. The user clicks on the "Customer Login" link again to submit the login form (`click.v1`). At this point, further events related to authentication or user interaction would be logged, but they are not included in this example.
