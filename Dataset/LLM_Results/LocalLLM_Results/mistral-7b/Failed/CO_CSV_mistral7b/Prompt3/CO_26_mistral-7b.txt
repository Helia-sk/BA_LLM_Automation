==================================================

 Here is a summary of the events in the log:

1. User navigated to the menu page ("/restaurant/dashboard/menu") using an anonymous session (session_1758984560651_foqjcq8xf). The user's browser was running Chrome version 140.0.0 on a Windows 10 system with a screen resolution of 1920x911 pixels.

2. The user clicked on the "Starters" section, which triggered the click event for that element. No additional details were provided for this event.

3. The user clicked on the "Add Item" button, which triggered the click event for that button. There was no associated text or class information available for this event.

4. The user clicked on an empty space within the list of menu items, which triggered the click event for that element. Again, no additional details were provided for this event.

5. The user clicked on an SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) icon, but no further information was given about which specific SVG or what action it represented.

6. A text input field was filled out with the value "cccc€0.04" and triggered the 'input' event. However, there were no details provided about where this input field was located, what it represents, or who filled it out.

7. Another text input field was filled out with the value "Saladmixvery healthy€0.08", but similar to the previous event, no additional information was given about its location or context.

8. A text input field was filled out with the value "Super sweet€1.00" and triggered the 'input' event. Again, there were no details provided about where this input field was located, what it represents, or who filled it out.

9. Finally, a text input field was filled out with the value "MojitoSuper Minti€1.00", but like the previous events, no additional information was given about its location or context.

Overall, the log provides some insights into user interaction on a web page, but it lacks specific details that would be helpful for understanding the context and purpose of those interactions.
