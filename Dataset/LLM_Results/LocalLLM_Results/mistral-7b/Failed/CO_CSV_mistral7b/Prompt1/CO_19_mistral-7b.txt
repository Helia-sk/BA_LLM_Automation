==================================================

 This is a log of events for a web application, specifically a customer login page on localhost:5173. The events are recorded in the order they occurred and each event has metadata attached to it that includes details about the user agent (browser), the timestamp, the type of event, and any other relevant information such as the element clicked or input changed.

   Here is a summary of what happened:

   1. A user navigated to the root path ("/") from the "restaurant/dashboard/settings" page on localhost:5173. This event was recorded as a page_view with the schema version "page_view.v1".

   2. The same user clicked the "Customer Login" link which triggered another click event. This event was recorded as a click event with the schema version "click.v1".

   3. The user then clicked on the username input field, this action also resulted in a click event being logged.

   4. Next, the user entered "User1" into the username input field. This action was logged as an input change event twice: once with the "trigger": "debounced_input" and another time with the "trigger": "click".

   5. The user then clicked on the password input field but no corresponding event was recorded in the log.

   6. The user entered a password into the password input field but no corresponding event was recorded in the log.

   7. The user clicked on the password input field again, this action also resulted in a click event being logged.

   8. The user then clicked the login button which triggered another click event. This event was recorded as a click event with the schema version "click.v1".

   9. Finally, a new session (session_1758982735683_6tqp38avs) was created when the user navigated to the customer login page ("/customer/login") by clicking the "Customer Login" link. This event was recorded as a page_view with the schema version "page_view.v1".

   After this sequence of events, it appears that the user either failed to enter the correct credentials or encountered an error while trying to log in, as no subsequent login-related events were logged.
