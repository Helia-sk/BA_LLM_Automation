==================================================

 From the logs provided, it appears that a user navigated to the "/restaurant/login" page from "/restaurant/dashboard". The user then clicked on a link labeled "Restaurant PartnersRegister your restaurant or log in to manage orders", which triggered a "page_view.v1" event for the "/restaurant/login" page.

The user then entered "User1" as their username and left the password field empty. After that, they clicked on the login button (or equivalent), but there is no corresponding log entry to indicate a successful or unsuccessful login attempt.

Finally, the user clicked on various fields related to the login form, including the username and password fields, but there are no subsequent events indicating any input or submission of data for those clicks. It seems that the logs do not include any information about whether the login was successful or not.
