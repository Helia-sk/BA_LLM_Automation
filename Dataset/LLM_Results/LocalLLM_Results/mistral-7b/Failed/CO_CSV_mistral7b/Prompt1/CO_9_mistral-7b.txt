==================================================

 This is a log of various events that occurred in a frontend application, specifically for the 'customer/dashboard' page. The events are recorded as logs with timestamps, user agent information, and details about the event itself.

   Here are some key observations:

   1. There are several scroll events, indicating the user is scrolling through the dashboard page. This is expected behavior for most web applications.

   2. There are also click events, which suggest that the user is interacting with various elements on the page, such as links and buttons. For example, a 'Restaurants' link was clicked at 2025-09-13T14:32:58.615Z, followed by a click event on an image area (probably a placeholder since it's labeled "No image available") at 2025-09-13T14:32:58.718Z, indicating the user likely navigated to a new page for a specific restaurant.

   3. The user returned to the dashboard by clicking another link or button (possibly "Restaurants" again) at 2025-09-13T14:32:57.591Z, then proceeded to scroll through the page.

   This log provides insight into user behavior on the 'customer/dashboard' page and can be used for UX analysis, performance optimization, or debugging purposes.
