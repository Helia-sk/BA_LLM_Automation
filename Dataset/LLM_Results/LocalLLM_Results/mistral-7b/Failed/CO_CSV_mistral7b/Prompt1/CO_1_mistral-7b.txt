==================================================

 Based on the logs, it appears that a user has performed the following steps:

1. Navigated to the customer login page at `http://localhost:5173/customer/login`.
2. Clicked on the "Customer Login" link (anchor tag).
3. Entered their username "User1" into the username input field.
4. Left the password field empty.
5. Clicked on the submit button, but it seems that no submission event was logged, indicating that either the password input was not filled out or there was a problem with the form submission process.
6. Entered "User1" again into the username input field (this could be due to a debounced input event).
7. Clicked on the submit button again, but it seems that no submission event was logged, indicating the same issue as before.
8. Clicked on the username input field again (click event, possibly trying to fill out the password field).
9. Entered the password into the password input field.
10. Clicked on the submit button, and this time a `submit` event was logged, but it appears that there was an issue with the form submission process as no further events were logged after this point.

It seems that there may be an issue with the form submission process, preventing the user from successfully logging in even when they have entered their credentials correctly. To troubleshoot this issue, you could:

1. Check if there are any errors being thrown during form submission (e.g., in the browser console or server logs).
2. Ensure that the submit event handler is properly attached to the form and that it is calling the appropriate function to handle the login process.
3. Verify that the login process itself is working correctly, by manually testing the code responsible for handling the login.
4. Check if there are any issues with server-side validation or authentication (e.g., incorrect credentials being passed to the server).
5. If using AJAX to submit the form, ensure that the response from the server is properly handled and displayed to the user.
