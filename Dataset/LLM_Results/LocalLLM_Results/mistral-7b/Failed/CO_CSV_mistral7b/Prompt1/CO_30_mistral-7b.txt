 This is a collection of logs showing user interactions with a web application, specifically with a dashboard for a restaurant. The logs show various events such as page views, button clicks, and navigation actions.

   Here are the significant events:

   1. A user navigated to the dashboard page (page_view event) using the URL `http://localhost:5173/restaurant/dashboard`. This event occurred at 2025-09-27T15:20:35.792Z and was triggered by a "navigation" action.

   2. The user clicked on the "History" link (click event) in the dashboard page, navigating to the history section of the dashboard at 2025-09-27T15:20:43.885Z. This was triggered by a "click" action.

   3. The user clicked on the "View Details" button (click event) in the history section, likely to view details of an order or some other item, at 2025-09-27T15:20:45.667Z. This was triggered by a "click" action.

   4. The user clicked on the "X" button (click event) in the history section to close it and return to the dashboard, at 2025-09-27T15:20:49.152Z. This was triggered by a "click" action.

   5. The user clicked on another link (click event) in the history section of the dashboard, possibly to navigate to a different part of the application, at 2025-09-27T15:20:49885Z. This was triggered by a "click" action.

   6. On the server side, an API request was made to `http://localhost:3000/api/orders/63a3b3e8-f056-47d1-9c2a-acbeeced4776` with a POST method and JSON data containing the status "rejected" at 2025-09-27T15:20:45.638Z. This event is associated with the order ID 63a3b3e8-f056-47d1-9c2a-acbeeced4776 and was triggered by a server action (API request).

   It appears that the user has navigated through the application, interacted with various elements on the pages, and potentially rejected an order. These logs can be useful for understanding user behavior and identifying areas for improvement in the application's design or functionality.
