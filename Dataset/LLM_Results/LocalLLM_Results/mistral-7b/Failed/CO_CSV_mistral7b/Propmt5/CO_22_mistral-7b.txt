==================================================

 The logs show a user interaction sequence with a web application. Here's the sequence of events:

1. The user clicks on a link to access the login page (`/restaurant/login`) of the application. This interaction is recorded in `log_1758985133183_ivi9skey6`.

2. Upon reaching the login page, the user does not interact with any input fields yet but hovers over the username field (`#username`). This hover event is recorded in `log_1758985133860_n2e4t50oy`.

3. The user clicks on the username field, focusing it for input. This interaction is recorded in `log_1758985133183_qr0zt2rti`.

4. The user types "User1" into the username field, and this input change event is recorded in `log_1758985133183_qr0zt2rti`.

5. The user then clicks on the password field (`#password`) to focus it for input. This interaction is recorded in `log_1758985135480_n2e4t50oy`.

6. The user types into the password field, but this event is not logged since there's no specific log event for typing characters into a password field.

7. After entering their username and password, the user clicks on the login button (implicit in the form submission). This event is not logged since it's assumed to be part of the form submission process.

8. The user submits the login form, which takes them to the dashboard or management area of the application. However, this event is not visible in these logs as they only contain frontend interaction events.
