==================================================

 Tag: Conversion
   Reason: The user has interacted with the application and completed an action (Viewing Order Details, clicking on "Done", and no further interaction). This sequence suggests that the user completed a task, which can be considered a conversion.

   1) [Step 1] The user visits the restaurant dashboard history page (/restaurant/dashboard/history) at timestamp 2025-09-14T07:45:51.066Z.
   2) [Step 2] The user clicks on the "History" link at x=691, y=121, which takes them to the history of orders. This action is recorded at timestamp 2025-09-14T07:45:51.066Z.
   3) [Step 3] The user clicks on a specific order's "View Details" button, which takes them to the details of that order (/api/orders/21/details). This action is recorded at timestamp 2025-09-14T07:46:01.979Z.
   4) [Step 4] The user interacts with the order details page, but there's no further interaction recorded, suggesting that they might have finished viewing the details. This action is not explicitly shown in the log file but can be inferred as a lack of subsequent interactions.
   5) [Step 5] The user clicks on the "Done" button (x=394, y=399), which presumably takes them back to the history page or some other relevant screen. This action is recorded at timestamp 2025-09-14T07:46:04.770Z. There are no subsequent interactions after this, suggesting that the user has completed their task and left the application (or there was a technical issue preventing further logging).
