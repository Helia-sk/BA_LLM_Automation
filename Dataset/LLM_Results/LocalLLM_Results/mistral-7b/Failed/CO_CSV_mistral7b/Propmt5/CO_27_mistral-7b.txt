 Tag: Conversion
   Reason: The user performed an action that resulted in a successful order acceptance, as indicated by the repeated requests and responses to the API endpoint `/api/orders/26/accept`.

   1) [Step 1] The session (session_id: 1758984560651_foqjcq8xf) started on the restaurant dashboard at http://localhost:5173/restaurant/dashboard.
   2) [Step 2] An anonymous user interacted with the "Accept" button (class name "flex-1 bg-green-500 text-white py-2 px-4 rounded-md hover:bg-green-600 focus:outline-none focus:ring-2 focus:ring-offset-2 focus:ring-green-500") on the dashboard. This interaction was logged as a click event at 2025-09-27T15:08:34.781Z.
   3) [Step 3] The backend responded to this request with an HTTP response, indicating that the order acceptance was being processed.
   4) [Step 4] This process repeated several times (as indicated by multiple entries with identical details), suggesting that the user was waiting for the order acceptance to be confirmed.
   5) [Step 5] After some time (2025-09-27T15:08:27.836Z), the user clicked on an SVG element on the dashboard, which was also logged as a click event. This could have been any interactive visual element such as an icon or a graphical interface control.
   6) [Step 6] Shortly after this interaction (implied by the timestamp), the backend confirmed the order acceptance, and the session ended with a final HTTP response. This suggests that the user was satisfied with the service provided, thus completing the conversion process.
