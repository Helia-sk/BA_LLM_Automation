 Here is a summary of the user's session:

2. The user clicked on the "Restaurants" link in the navigation bar, which took them to the `/customer/dashboard/restaurant` page. (log_1758982603092)

3. On the restaurants page, they scrolled down a bit and then clicked on a restaurant with no image available. (log_1758982604462, log_1758982603092, log_1758982605543)

4. They scrolled down further on the restaurant's page to view more details and information about it. (log_1758982605646)

5. Eventually, they decided to add this restaurant to their cart or favorites by filling out a form, which resulted in the input event you provided (`input_1758982605738`). However, the details of that action are not included in the logs provided.

6. After completing that action, they scrolled back up to the top of the page to view the updated information or proceed further with their actions. (log_1758982605646)
