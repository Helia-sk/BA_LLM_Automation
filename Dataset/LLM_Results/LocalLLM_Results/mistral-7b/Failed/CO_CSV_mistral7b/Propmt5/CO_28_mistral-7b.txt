==================================================

 This log appears to be a series of event logs from a web application, possibly from an analytics or tracking system. Each log contains the following information:

- A unique identifier for the event (e.g., `log_1758985849032_pt9psc4kp`)
- The type of event that occurred (e.g., `input_change`, `click`, `form_submit`)
- A session ID, which can help identify the user or browser making the request
- Additional information about the event, such as the URL of the page where the event occurred and details about the element that triggered the event
- Additional data specific to each event type (e.g., `inputId`, `inputName`, `inputValue` for an `input_change` event)

Here's a breakdown of the events in the log:

1. The user navigated to the page at `/restaurant/login`. This was likely a click event on a link or button that led them to this page. (`log_1758985849032_pt9psc4kp`, `click`, `session_1758985838498_26779dlfk`)

2. The user entered their username and password for the login form on the page (`log_1758985849132_sm9gb6j5r`, `click`, `session_1758985838498_26779dlfk`)
   - The user clicked the "Sign In" button (`log_1758985849134_vaj1bttsz`, `form_submit`, `session_1758985838498_26779dlfk`)
   - The user's password was inputted, but the value is hidden for privacy reasons (`log_1758985849032_pt9psc4kp`, `input_change`, `session_1758985838498_26779dlfk`)

3. The user clicked the "History" link on the page at `/restaurant/dashboard` (`log_1758985849134_sm9gb6j5r`, `click`, `session_1758985838498_26779dlfk`)

4. The user clicked the "Dashboard" link on the page at `/restaurant/dashboard` (`log_1758985859153_18r2yglts`, `click`, `session_1758985838498_26779dlfk`)

5. The user clicked the "X" button on the page at `/restaurant/dashboard` (this is likely a close or dismiss button) (`log_1758985859153_se2my4qmv`, `click`, `session_1758985838498_26779dlfk`)

6. The user clicked the "Sign Out" button on the page at `/restaurant/dashboard` (this is likely a logout action) (`log_1758985859153_s23rs0wo7`, `click`, `session_1758985838498_26779dlfk`)
