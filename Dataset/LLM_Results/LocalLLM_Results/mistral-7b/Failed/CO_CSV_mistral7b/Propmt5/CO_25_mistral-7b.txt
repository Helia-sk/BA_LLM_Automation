 Tag: Conversion
   Reason: The user navigated to the menu page, scrolled through it, and clicked on an item, which suggests they were interested in making a purchase or at least exploring the offerings. This sequence indicates a conversion as the user took several steps towards completing a transaction or achieving a desired goal.

   Step 1: User initiated a session by visiting the restaurant's dashboard (`/restaurant/dashboard/menu`)
   Step 2: The system responded with the menu page (HTTP response)
   Step 3: User scrolled through the menu page (scroll event)
   Step 4: User clicked on an item in the menu (click event), indicating interest or intent to order that item.

In this log, we don't have evidence of the user completing a purchase, but based on their interaction with the menu page, it is reasonable to assume they were engaged and potentially planning to make a purchase. This could be considered a conversion in terms of user engagement and intent.
