Prompt: Analyze the log file. For each required core event
(Login, Registration, Add Item, Modify Cart, Place Order, etc.),
check if it was explicitly completed in the logs.
Mark each event as True (completed) or False (not completed).
==================================================

1. Login: True - The log shows multiple clicks on the "Customer Login" link, indicating a successful login.
2. Registration: False - There is no evidence of any registration-related events in the log.
3. Add Item: Not Applicable - There are no explicit add item events in the log as it only records user interactions with the UI but not actual inventory manipulation.
4. Modify Cart: Not Applicable - Similar to "Add Item", there is no evidence of cart modification events in the log.
5. Place Order: False - The log does not contain any orders being placed or payment-related events.
6. Other Core Events:
   - Logout: False - No logout event is present in the log.
   - Profile Update: False - No profile update event is present in the log.
