Prompt: Analyze the log file. For each required core event
(Login, Registration, Add Item, Modify Cart, Place Order, etc.),
check if it was explicitly completed in the logs.
Mark each event as True (completed) or False (not completed).
==================================================

1. Login: False - No login event is found in the provided log file.
2. Registration: False - No registration event is found in the provided log file.
3. Add Item:
   - True - The click event on the 'ImageDrag image here or click to upload' button under the form with id '' could be considered as an 'Add Item' event, if it refers to adding an image for a new item. However, no further information about the item or the upload process is available in the log file, so this assumption is unconfirmed.
4. Modify Cart: False - No cart modification events are found in the provided log file.
5. Place Order: False - No order placement event is found in the provided log file.
6. Logout: False - No logout event is found in the provided log file.
