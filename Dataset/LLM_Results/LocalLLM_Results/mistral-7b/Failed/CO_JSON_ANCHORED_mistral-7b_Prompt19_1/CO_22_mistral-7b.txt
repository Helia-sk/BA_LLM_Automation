Prompt: Analyze the log file. For each required core event
(Login, Registration, Add Item, Modify Cart, Place Order, etc.),
check if it was explicitly completed in the logs.
Mark each event as True (completed) or False (not completed).
==================================================

1. Login: True - The log file shows multiple events related to username and password input, which suggests a login attempt has been made.

2. Registration: False - There are no events that indicate user registration in the given log file.

3. Add Item: Not Available - There is no specific event in the log file to determine if an item was added to the cart. However, it's possible to observe user interactions with elements related to the product page, but that doesn't guarantee adding an item to the cart.

4. Modify Cart: Not Available - Similar to Add Item, there is no specific event in the log file to determine if a user modified their cart. Interactions with cart-related elements can be observed, but it doesn't necessarily mean the cart was modified.

5. Place Order: False - The given log file does not contain any events that indicate an order was placed by the user.
