Prompt: Analyze the log file. For each required core event
(Login, Registration, Add Item, Modify Cart, Place Order, etc.),
check if it was explicitly completed in the logs.
Mark each event as True (completed) or False (not completed).
==================================================

1. Login: True - The logs show a 'Customer Login' click event which indicates that the user has logged in successfully.

2. Registration: False - There is no registration event found in the logs, suggesting that no new user registered during this session.

3. Add Item:
    - It seems there are multiple clicks on an input field for 'username', but without additional context it's unclear if this represents adding an item to a cart or not. So let's mark it as Undetermined (U).

4. Modify Cart:
    - There is no specific event that indicates the user modified their cart, so we can mark it as False (not completed).

5. Place Order:
    - Similarly, there is no event that suggests the user placed an order during this session, so we can mark it as False (not completed).
