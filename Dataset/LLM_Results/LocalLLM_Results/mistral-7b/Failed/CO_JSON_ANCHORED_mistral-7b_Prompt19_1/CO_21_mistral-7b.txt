Prompt: Analyze the log file. For each required core event
(Login, Registration, Add Item, Modify Cart, Place Order, etc.),
check if it was explicitly completed in the logs.
Mark each event as True (completed) or False (not completed).
==================================================

1. Login: True - The log shows a user navigating to the login page and then entering their credentials and clicking the login button.

2. Registration: False - There is no evidence of registration in the provided logs, as they only show a user logging in.

3. Add Item: Not Available - It's unclear from the given logs whether adding an item to the cart occurred or not, as there are no specific events related to this action.

4. Modify Cart: Not Available - Similarly, there is no evidence of modifying the cart in the provided logs.

5. Place Order: Not Available - There are no logs indicating that an order was placed by the user.

6. Other Events (e.g., Account Setup, Profile Update, Feedback Submission, etc.): Not Available - The given logs do not provide enough information to determine if any of these events occurred or not. More detailed logs would be required for accurate analysis.
