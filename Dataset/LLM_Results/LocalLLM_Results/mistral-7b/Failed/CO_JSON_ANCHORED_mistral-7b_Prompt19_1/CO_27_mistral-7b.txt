Prompt: Analyze the log file. For each required core event
(Login, Registration, Add Item, Modify Cart, Place Order, etc.),
check if it was explicitly completed in the logs.
Mark each event as True (completed) or False (not completed).
==================================================

1. Login: False (Not found in the logs)
2. Registration: False (Not found in the logs)
3. Add Item: False (Not found in the logs)
4. Modify Cart: False (Not found in the logs)
5. Place Order: True (The logs contain an event with the endpoint "orders.accept_order", which could be considered as placing an order, although it's not explicit that this is a new order)
