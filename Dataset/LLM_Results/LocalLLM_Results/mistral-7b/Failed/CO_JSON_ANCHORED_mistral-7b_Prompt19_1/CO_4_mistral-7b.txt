Prompt: Analyze the log file. For each required core event
(Login, Registration, Add Item, Modify Cart, Place Order, etc.),
check if it was explicitly completed in the logs.
Mark each event as True (completed) or False (not completed).
==================================================

1. Login: True - The provided log shows a user clicking on the "Restaurant Login" link and then proceeding to the login page.

2. Registration: False - There is no evidence in the logs that the user registered for an account during this session.

3. Add Item: Not Possible to Determine - The logs do not show any addition of items to a cart or order. However, it's also important to note that adding an item would typically involve clicking on an "Add to Cart" button, which is not present in the provided log data.

4. Modify Cart: Not Possible to Determine - Similar to the Add Item event, there is no direct evidence of cart modification in the logs. Clicking on a "Modify Cart" button or similar would likely be required for this event.

5. Place Order: False - There is no indication in the logs that an order was placed during this session.

6. Other Events (such as View Product, Update Profile, etc.): Not Possible to Determine - The provided log only includes events related to navigating the login page and clicking on links. It does not include specific product-related interactions or profile updates.
