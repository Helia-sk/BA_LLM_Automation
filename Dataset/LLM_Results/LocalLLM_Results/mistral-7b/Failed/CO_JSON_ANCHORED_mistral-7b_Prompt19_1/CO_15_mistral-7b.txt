Prompt: Analyze the log file. For each required core event
(Login, Registration, Add Item, Modify Cart, Place Order, etc.),
check if it was explicitly completed in the logs.
Mark each event as True (completed) or False (not completed).
==================================================

1. Login: True - The log file shows a click event on the "Customer Login" button, followed by a click event on an input field related to the login form, suggesting that a login attempt was made.

2. Registration: False - There are no events in the log file that suggest a registration process was initiated or completed.

3. Add Item: False - The log file does not contain any event that indicates adding an item to the cart. However, it is possible that such an event might have occurred outside of the time frame captured by this log file.

4. Modify Cart: False - Similarly, there are no events in the log file that suggest modifying the cart (e.g., removing or updating an item).

5. Place Order: False - The log file does not show any evidence of a place order event being triggered. It is possible that such an event might have occurred outside of the time frame captured by this log file.

6. Other events, such as viewing a product page, navigating between pages, or performing specific actions within the application, can be determined based on the available information in the log file. For example:
   - Viewing a product page: True - The log file shows a navigation event to the "/" route, which could represent a homepage with product listings.
   - Navigating between pages: True - Multiple navigation events are present in the log file, indicating that the user navigated through different pages within the application.
