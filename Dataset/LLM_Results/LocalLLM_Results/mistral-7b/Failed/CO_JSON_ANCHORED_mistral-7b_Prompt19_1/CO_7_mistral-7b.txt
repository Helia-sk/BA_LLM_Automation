Prompt: Analyze the log file. For each required core event
(Login, Registration, Add Item, Modify Cart, Place Order, etc.),
check if it was explicitly completed in the logs.
Mark each event as True (completed) or False (not completed).
==================================================

1. Login: True - The first few events indicate that a user clicked on the "Customer Login" link, then clicked on the "UsernamePasswordSign In" form and entered their username and password, which suggests a successful login.

2. Registration: False - There is no evidence in the log file to suggest that the user registered during this session. The events only show interaction with the login form, not the registration form.

3. Add Item: Depends - While there are events related to interacting with various elements on the page, such as clicking buttons and input fields, it's not clear if these actions were associated with adding an item to a cart or not. More specific event labels would be needed to confirm this.

4. Modify Cart: Depends - Similar to the Add Item event, there are interactions with various elements on the page, but without more specific event labels, it's hard to determine if these actions were related to modifying a cart or not.

5. Place Order: False - The log file does not show any events indicating that an order was placed during this session. The user only interacted with the login and navigation parts of the website.
