Prompt: Analyze the log file. For each required core event
(Login, Registration, Add Item, Modify Cart, Place Order, etc.),
check if it was explicitly completed in the logs.
Mark each event as True (completed) or False (not completed).
==================================================

1. Login: True - The log file shows a "Customer Login" event with a corresponding click event on the login button, indicating that the user successfully logged in.

2. Registration: False - There is no explicit registration event in the provided log file. However, it does not necessarily mean that there was no registration activity as the log file might not contain all events.

3. Add Item: Indeterminate - The log file doesn't show an "Add Item" event explicitly. However, if we consider other related events like navigating to product pages or clicking on 'add to cart', we can infer that adding items might have happened but without solid evidence, it is hard to confirm.

4. Modify Cart: Indeterminate - Similar to the "Add Item" event, there's no explicit "Modify Cart" event in the log file. However, if the user clicked on 'remove from cart' or changed the quantity of an item, we can infer that modifying the cart might have occurred, but again, without solid evidence, it is hard to confirm.

5. Place Order: Indeterminate - There's no explicit "Place Order" event in the log file. However, if the user clicked on 'proceed to checkout' or made a payment, we can infer that placing an order might have occurred, but without solid evidence, it is hard to confirm.
