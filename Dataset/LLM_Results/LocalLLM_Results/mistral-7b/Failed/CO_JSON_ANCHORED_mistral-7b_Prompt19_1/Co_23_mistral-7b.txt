Prompt: Analyze the log file. For each required core event
(Login, Registration, Add Item, Modify Cart, Place Order, etc.),
check if it was explicitly completed in the logs.
Mark each event as True (completed) or False (not completed).
==================================================

1. Login: False (There are no login events in the log file)
2. Registration: False (There are no registration events in the log file)
3. Add Item: True (The log contains an "Add" event, although it's not explicitly clear that it's adding an item to a cart)
4. Modify Cart: Unclear (Although there is an interaction with an input field that could potentially be modifying the cart, there is no explicit "Modify Cart" event)
5. Place Order: False (There are no place order events in the log file)
