Prompt: Analyze the log file. For each required core event
(Login, Registration, Add Item, Modify Cart, Place Order, etc.),
check if it was explicitly completed in the logs.
Mark each event as True (completed) or False (not completed).
==================================================

1. Login: True (The user navigated to the login page and clicked the login button, so a login attempt was made.)
2. Registration: False (There is no evidence of a registration attempt in these logs.)
3. Add Item: False (There is no event indicating adding an item to the cart in these logs.)
4. Modify Cart: False (Similarly, there is no event that suggests modifying the cart in these logs.)
5. Place Order: False (No order placement event was found in these logs.)
