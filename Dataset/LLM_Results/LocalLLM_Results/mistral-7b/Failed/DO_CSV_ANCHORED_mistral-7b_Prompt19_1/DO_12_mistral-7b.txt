Prompt: Analyze the log file. For each required core event
(Login, Registration, Add Item, Modify Cart, Place Order, etc.),
check if it was explicitly completed in the logs.
Mark each event as True (completed) or False (not completed).
==================================================

1. Login: True (The first few log entries indicate a successful login to the customer account on Lieferspatz restaurant.)
2. Registration: False (There are no log entries indicating user registration.)
3. Add Item: False (No log entries suggest adding an item to the cart or similar actions.)
4. Modify Cart: False (Similarly, there are no log entries related to modifying a cart.)
5. Place Order: False (Likewise, there is no evidence of placing an order in the logs.)
6. Other Events (like Searching, Viewing Products, etc.): These events cannot be determined based on the provided logs as they are not explicitly mentioned. However, it can be inferred that the user has viewed the Lieferspatz homepage and customer login page.
