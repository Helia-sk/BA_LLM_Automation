Prompt: Analyze the log file. For each required core event
(Login, Registration, Add Item, Modify Cart, Place Order, etc.),
check if it was explicitly completed in the logs.
Mark each event as True (completed) or False (not completed).
==================================================

1. Login: True (The user started a session by clicking on "Restaurant Login")
2. Registration: False (There is no evidence of registration in these logs)
3. Add Item: False (No add item event found in the logs)
4. Modify Cart: False (Similarly, there is no modify cart event in the logs)
5. Place Order: False (Again, we don't see any place order event)
6. Other possible events such as View Menu, Search Item, Change Language, etc., are not explicitly mentioned in these logs. It would be difficult to determine if they occurred or not without additional information.
