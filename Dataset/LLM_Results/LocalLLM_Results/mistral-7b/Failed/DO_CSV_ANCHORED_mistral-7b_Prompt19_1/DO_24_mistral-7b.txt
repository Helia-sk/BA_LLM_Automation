Prompt: Analyze the log file. For each required core event
(Login, Registration, Add Item, Modify Cart, Place Order, etc.),
check if it was explicitly completed in the logs.
Mark each event as True (completed) or False (not completed).
==================================================

1. Login: False - There is no explicit "Login" event found in the provided log file. The events shown are related to user interactions with the form fields, but there is no indication of a successful login.

2. Registration: False - Similarly, there is no explicit "Registration" event found in the logs. However, the presence of a "username" field suggests that registration might be possible, but without further context or an explicit registration action, it remains unconfirmed.

3. Add Item: False - There is no explicit "Add Item" event found in the logs. The user interactions shown are limited to filling out form fields for username and password.

4. Modify Cart: False - Based on the provided log file, there is no indication of any cart-related actions like adding or modifying items in the cart.

5. Place Order: False - There is no explicit "Place Order" event found in the logs. The events shown are related to user interactions with form fields, but there is no indication of a successful order placement.

6. Other potential events (such as Logout, Forgot Password, etc.) cannot be confirmed or denied based on the provided log file, as these specific events are not shown in the logs.
