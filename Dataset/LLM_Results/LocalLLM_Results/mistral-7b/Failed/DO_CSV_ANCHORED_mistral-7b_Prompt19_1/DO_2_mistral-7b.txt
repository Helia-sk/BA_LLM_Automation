Prompt: Analyze the log file. For each required core event
(Login, Registration, Add Item, Modify Cart, Place Order, etc.),
check if it was explicitly completed in the logs.
Mark each event as True (completed) or False (not completed).
==================================================

1. Login: True (both /restaurant/login and /customer/login events indicate a login attempt)
2. Registration: False (There is no registration event in the given log file)
3. Add Item: False (No 'Add Item' event in the logs)
4. Modify Cart: False (No 'Modify Cart' event in the logs)
5. Place Order: False (No 'Place Order' event in the logs)

Note that these findings are based on the given log data and do not take into account any other possible events or actions that may lead to a login, registration, adding an item, modifying cart, or placing an order. The log file appears to only contain frontend click and scroll events with no information about actual user interactions such as adding items to the cart, modifying cart details, or placing an order.
