Prompt: Analyze the log file. For each required core event
(Login, Registration, Add Item, Modify Cart, Place Order, etc.),
check if it was explicitly completed in the logs.
Mark each event as True (completed) or False (not completed).
==================================================

1. Login: True - The log shows multiple events related to user interaction with the login form, indicating a successful login has occurred.
2. Registration: False - There is no evidence of any registration-related events in the provided logs.
3. Add Item: Not Applicable (N/A) - The logs do not contain any information about adding an item to a cart or similar functionality, so it cannot be determined if this event was completed.
4. Modify Cart: N/A - As with "Add Item," there is no evidence of cart-related events in the provided logs, so it's impossible to determine if this event was completed.
5. Place Order: N/A - Similar to the previous two events, the logs do not provide any information about placing an order, making it impossible to determine if this event was completed.
6. Other events (Search, View Product Details, Change Address, etc.): Not Applicable - The provided logs only contain core user interactions related to login and form filling, so it's impossible to determine if these additional events were completed based on the available data.
