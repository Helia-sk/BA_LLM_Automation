Prompt: Analyze the log file. For each required core event
(Login, Registration, Add Item, Modify Cart, Place Order, etc.),
check if it was explicitly completed in the logs.
Mark each event as True (completed) or False (not completed).
==================================================

1. Login: True (The logs show multiple input_change and click events related to a username and password field, indicating that the user attempted to login.)
2. Registration: False (There are no explicit registration-related events in the provided log file.)
3. Add Item: False (No add item event found in the logs.)
4. Modify Cart: False (Similar to add item, there is no modify cart event found in the logs.)
5. Place Order: False (The logs do not contain any place order events.)
6. Other possible core events like View Product, Search Product, etc.: It's not possible to determine if these events occurred based on the provided log file since it only contains login-related events and scroll/click events.
