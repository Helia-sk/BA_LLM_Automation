Prompt: Analyze the log file. For each required core event
(Login, Registration, Add Item, Modify Cart, Place Order, etc.),
check if it was explicitly completed in the logs.
Mark each event as True (completed) or False (not completed).

2. Registration: False - There is no explicit evidence in the logs that a registration event was triggered.
3. Add Item: False - There is no evidence in the logs that an 'Add Item' event was triggered.
4. Modify Cart: False - There is no evidence in the logs that a 'Modify Cart' event was triggered.
5. Place Order: False - There is no evidence in the logs that a 'Place Order' event was triggered.
6. Other events like Search, Navigation, Error etc. cannot be determined from the provided log as there is no explicit information about these events.
