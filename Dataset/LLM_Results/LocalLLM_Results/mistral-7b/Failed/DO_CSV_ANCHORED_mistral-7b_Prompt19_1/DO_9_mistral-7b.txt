Prompt: Analyze the log file. For each required core event
(Login, Registration, Add Item, Modify Cart, Place Order, etc.),
check if it was explicitly completed in the logs.
Mark each event as True (completed) or False (not completed).
==================================================

1. Login: True - The log shows a "Customer Login" click event.
2. Registration: False - There is no registration-related event in the logs.
3. Add Item: False - There are no add item, remove item, or any cart manipulation events in the logs.
4. Modify Cart: False - See the explanation for Add Item.
5. Place Order: False - There are no place order events in the logs.
6. Other Events (Search, Filter, Sort, Navigation):
   - Search: False - No search-related event is present in the logs.
   - Filter: False - No filtering events are present in the logs.
   - Sort: False - No sorting events are present in the logs.
   - Navigation (Page Views, Link Clicks):
     - Page Views: It's not clear from the logs if page views occurred since we don't have timestamps for each event or any indication of which pages were visited. However, we can assume that at least one page view must have happened to display the login page (/customer/login).
     - Link Clicks: True - There are several click events on different links, such as a customer login link and username input field click events.
