Prompt: Analyze the log file. For each required core event
(Login, Registration, Add Item, Modify Cart, Place Order, etc.),
check if it was explicitly completed in the logs.
Mark each event as True (completed) or False (not completed).
==================================================

1. Login: False (No login event found in the logs)
2. Registration: False (No registration event found in the logs)
3. Add Item: False (No 'Add Item' event found in the logs)
4. Modify Cart: False (No 'Modify Cart' event found in the logs)
5. Place Order: False (No 'Place Order' event found in the logs)
6. Any other custom events should be checked based on the specific actions performed, if any such events are present in the logs. For example, if there is a 'View Menu' event, it could be marked as True if it is found in the logs. However, no other custom events were found in the given logs.
