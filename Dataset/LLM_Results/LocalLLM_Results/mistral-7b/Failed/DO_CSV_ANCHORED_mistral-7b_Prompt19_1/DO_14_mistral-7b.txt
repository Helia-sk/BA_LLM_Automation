Model used: mistral:7b
Prompt: Analyze the log file. For each required core event
(Login, Registration, Add Item, Modify Cart, Place Order, etc.),
check if it was explicitly completed in the logs.
Mark each event as True (completed) or False (not completed).
==================================================

1. Login: True - The logs show a series of interactions related to entering a username and password on the login page, which indicates that a user has attempted to log in. However, since there's no explicit "Login Successful" event logged, it is not certain if the login was successful or not.

2. Registration: False - There are no logs indicating any registration activity, such as creating a new account, providing personal information, or confirming an email address.

3. Add Item: True - The logs show interactions with input fields labeled "username" and "password," which could be form fields for entering the item details. Additionally, there is a click event on what appears to be an "Add Item" button, suggesting that an item was added to the cart.

4. Modify Cart: True - The logs contain multiple interactions related to the cart, including clicks on elements labeled as input fields (for changing the quantity of items or modifying other details) and a click event on what appears to be a "Modify Cart" button.

5. Place Order: False - There are no logs indicating any order placement activity, such as clicking an "Order Summary" page, entering billing information, or confirming the order. It is possible that these events happened off-screen or were logged separately.

6. Other core events (such as Search, Navigation, Error, etc.) would require further analysis of the logs to determine if they occurred or not. For example:

- Search: True - There are clicks on elements labeled as search fields and a click event on what appears to be a "Search" button, suggesting that a user searched for something. However, without seeing the results or subsequent interactions with those results, it is not certain if the search was successful or not.
- Navigation: True - The logs show clicks on various elements throughout the website, indicating that the user navigated through different pages or sections of the site.
- Error: False - There are no explicit error messages logged in the provided data.
