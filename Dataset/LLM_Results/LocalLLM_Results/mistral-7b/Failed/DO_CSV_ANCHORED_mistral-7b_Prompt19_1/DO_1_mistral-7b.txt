Prompt: Analyze the log file. For each required core event
(Login, Registration, Add Item, Modify Cart, Place Order, etc.),
check if it was explicitly completed in the logs.
Mark each event as True (completed) or False (not completed).
==================================================

1. Login: True (The user has logged in since the log file shows a 'click' event on the "Customer Login" link.)
2. Registration: False (There is no registration event recorded in the logs.)
3. Add Item: Not Applicable (The logs do not show any addition of items to the cart.)
4. Modify Cart: Not Applicable (Similarly, there are no modifications to the cart observed in the logs.)
5. Place Order: Not Applicable (No order placement event is found in the provided logs.)
