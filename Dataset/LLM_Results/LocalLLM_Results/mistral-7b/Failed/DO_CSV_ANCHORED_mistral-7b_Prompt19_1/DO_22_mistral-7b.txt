Prompt: Analyze the log file. For each required core event
(Login, Registration, Add Item, Modify Cart, Place Order, etc.),
check if it was explicitly completed in the logs.
Mark each event as True (completed) or False (not completed).
==================================================

1. Login: False (There is no 'Login' event in the log file)
2. Registration: False (There is no 'Registration' event in the log file)
3. Add Item: False (There is no 'Add Item' event in the log file)
4. Modify Cart: False (There is no 'Modify Cart' event in the log file)
5. Place Order: False (There is no 'Place Order' event in the log file)

However, the provided logs do show a sequence of events that suggest a user navigated to the login page and entered their username (twice), then clicked the 'Restaurant Login' button. This could potentially be considered as an implicit form of "Login" attempt, but without further information about successful authentication or subsequent actions, it is not possible to definitively confirm a 'Login' event in the logs.
