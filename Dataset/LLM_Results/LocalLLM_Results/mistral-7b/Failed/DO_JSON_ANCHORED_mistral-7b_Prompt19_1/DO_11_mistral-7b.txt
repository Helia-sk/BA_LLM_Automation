Prompt: Analyze the log file. For each required core event
(Login, Registration, Add Item, Modify Cart, Place Order, etc.),
check if it was explicitly completed in the logs.
Mark each event as True (completed) or False (not completed).
==================================================

1. Login: The provided log file does not contain any explicit events related to a login process. However, it starts with an event where a user clicked on the "Customer Login" button, so we can assume that a login attempt was made but no successful login event is recorded in these logs. (Status: False)

2. Registration: The log file does not contain any explicit events related to a registration process. (Status: False)

3. Add Item: The log file does not contain any explicit events related to adding an item to the cart. However, since we don't have information about what specific actions were performed after the login attempt, we cannot definitively say that no items were added to the cart. (Status: Unknown)

4. Modify Cart: Similarly, as with Add Item, the log file does not contain any explicit events related to modifying the cart. Without more information about what specific actions were performed after the login attempt, we cannot definitively say whether or not the cart was modified. (Status: Unknown)

5. Place Order: The log file does not contain any explicit events related to placing an order. Based on the information provided, we can assume that no order was placed in these sessions. (Status: False)
