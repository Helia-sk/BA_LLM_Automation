Prompt: Analyze the log file. For each required core event
(Login, Registration, Add Item, Modify Cart, Place Order, etc.),
check if it was explicitly completed in the logs.
Mark each event as True (completed) or False (not completed).
==================================================

1. Login: True - The user navigated to the login page and clicked the "Register your restaurant or log in to manage orders" link, indicating a login attempt.

2. Registration: False - There is no explicit evidence of registration in the provided logs.

3. Add Item: False - While there are clicks on various elements that could potentially be related to adding items, the logs do not provide sufficient information to confirm an "Add Item" event.

4. Modify Cart: False - Similarly, while there are clicks on elements that might relate to modifying a cart, such as "username" and "click" events, the logs don't explicitly show any modification of a cart.

5. Place Order: False - The logs do not indicate an "Place Order" event as there is no evidence of a user navigating to a page or performing actions that would suggest they placed an order.
