Model used: mistral:7b
Prompt: Analyze the log file. For each required core event
(Login, Registration, Add Item, Modify Cart, Place Order, etc.),
check if it was explicitly completed in the logs.
Mark each event as True (completed) or False (not completed).
==================================================

1. Login: False (There is no explicit log for a login event in this data.)
2. Registration: False (Similar to login, there's no registration event in the given logs.)
3. Add Item: False (No logs indicate adding an item explicitly.)
4. Modify Cart: False (No explicit modification of the cart can be found in the provided logs.)
5. Place Order: False (No order placement is visible in the logs.)
6. Search: It seems there's no specific event for search, but the first click event could possibly represent a user navigating to find the search bar or function. However, it's not definitive since we don't have information about the clicked element. So, let's consider it as Unknown (cannot determine).
7. View Product: It seems that some of the clicks on elements could be related to viewing products, but again, there is no explicit indication of this in the logs. Therefore, let's mark it as Unknown (cannot determine).
8. Navigation: Yes (Scroll and click events suggest navigation within the website.)
