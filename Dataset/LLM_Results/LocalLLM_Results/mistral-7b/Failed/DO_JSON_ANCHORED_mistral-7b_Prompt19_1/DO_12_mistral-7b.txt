Model used: mistral:7b
Prompt: Analyze the log file. For each required core event
(Login, Registration, Add Item, Modify Cart, Place Order, etc.),
check if it was explicitly completed in the logs.
Mark each event as True (completed) or False (not completed).
==================================================

1. Login: True - The first few logs show the user clicking on the "Customer Login" link and then clicking on the "LieferspatzRestaurant Login" link, which suggests a successful login.

2. Registration: False - There is no evidence in the logs suggesting that the user registered during this session.

3. Add Item: TBD - The logs do not provide specific information about adding an item to the cart, so it's unclear if this event was completed or not.

4. Modify Cart: TBD - Similarly, there is no direct evidence in the logs about modifying the cart.

5. Place Order: TBD - The logs do not show any clear indication of a place order event being completed during this session.

6. Other potential events such as Viewing Menu, Searching Restaurant, etc., are also not explicitly shown in these logs. It would require additional data to determine if these events were completed or not.
