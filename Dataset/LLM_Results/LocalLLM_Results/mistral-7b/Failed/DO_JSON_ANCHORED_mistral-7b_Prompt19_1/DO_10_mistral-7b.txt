Prompt: Analyze the log file. For each required core event
(Login, Registration, Add Item, Modify Cart, Place Order, etc.),
check if it was explicitly completed in the logs.
Mark each event as True (completed) or False (not completed).
==================================================

1. Login: True - The log shows a 'Customer Login' click event, which indicates that the user has logged in.

2. Registration: False - There is no explicit registration event in the logs.

3. Add Item: False - There is no explicit 'Add Item' event in the logs.

4. Modify Cart: False - There is no explicit 'Modify Cart' event in the logs.

5. Place Order: False - There is no explicit 'Place Order' event in the logs.

6. Other core events (such as Forgot Password, Account Deletion, etc.) are not present in the provided log file and thus cannot be determined without additional information.
