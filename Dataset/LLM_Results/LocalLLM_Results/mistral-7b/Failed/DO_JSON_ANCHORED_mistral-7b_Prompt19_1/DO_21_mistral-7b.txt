Prompt: Analyze the log file. For each required core event
(Login, Registration, Add Item, Modify Cart, Place Order, etc.),
check if it was explicitly completed in the logs.
Mark each event as True (completed) or False (not completed).
==================================================

1. Login: False (The logs don't show any explicit login event, but there are click events on the "Restaurant Login" link which could potentially lead to a login page.)

2. Registration: False (There is no registration event in the logs.)

3. Add Item: False (There is no add item event in the logs.)

4. Modify Cart: False (There is no modify cart event in the logs.)

5. Place Order: False (There is no place order event in the logs.)

6. View Menu: This could be potentially True, as there are click events on the "Restaurant Login" link which could lead to a menu page. However, without explicit evidence of viewing the menu, it's hard to definitively say whether this event was completed or not.

7. View Order History: This could be potentially True, if there is a feature in the application that allows users to view their order history. Without explicit evidence of viewing order history, it's hard to definitively say whether this event was completed or not.

8. View Profile: This could be potentially True, if there is a feature in the application that allows users to view their profile. Without explicit evidence of viewing a profile, it's hard to definitively say whether this event was completed or not.

9. Logout: False (There is no logout event in the logs.)
