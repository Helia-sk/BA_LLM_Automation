Prompt: Analyze the log file. For each required core event
(Login, Registration, Add Item, Modify Cart, Place Order, etc.),
check if it was explicitly completed in the logs.
Mark each event as True (completed) or False (not completed).
==================================================

1. Login: True - The user clicked on the "Customer Login" button, which suggests that they have logged in.
2. Registration: False - There is no evidence in the log file that the user has registered an account.
3. Add Item: False - While the user navigated to different parts of the site (e.g., clicked on a product), there is no explicit action indicating that they added an item to the cart.
4. Modify Cart: False - Similarly, there is no evidence in the log file that the user modified their cart by removing or changing items.
5. Place Order: False - The user has not placed an order as there is no record of clicking on a "Place Order" button or similar action.
6. Other potential events (View Product, Search, etc.) cannot be definitively determined based on the provided log file. However, it shows that the user navigated through different pages and interacted with various UI elements.
