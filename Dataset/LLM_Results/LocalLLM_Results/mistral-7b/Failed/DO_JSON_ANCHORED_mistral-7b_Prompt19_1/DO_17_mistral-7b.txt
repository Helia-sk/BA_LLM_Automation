Prompt: Analyze the log file. For each required core event
(Login, Registration, Add Item, Modify Cart, Place Order, etc.),
check if it was explicitly completed in the logs.
Mark each event as True (completed) or False (not completed).
==================================================

1. Login: True (The logs show a user clicking on the "Sign In" button and then entering their username into the input field.)

2. Registration: False (There is no evidence of registration in these logs.)

3. Add Item: False (No action was recorded that corresponds to adding an item to the cart.)

4. Modify Cart: False (No action was recorded that corresponds to modifying the cart.)

5. Place Order: False (No action was recorded that corresponds to placing an order.)

6. Other events such as "Viewing Products", "Loading Page", "Navigation" can be marked as True based on various actions observed in the logs, like clicking links or interacting with different parts of the page. However, it's important to note that without more context about the specific pages and components being interacted with, it's not possible to definitively say whether these events occurred.
