Prompt: Analyze the log file. For each required core event
(Login, Registration, Add Item, Modify Cart, Place Order, etc.),
check if it was explicitly completed in the logs.
Mark each event as True (completed) or False (not completed).
==================================================

1. Login: False (The logs do not show any explicit login event. However, the first entry seems to be a page load where the user might have logged in, but there's no confirmation of it.)

2. Registration: False (No registration event was found in the logs.)

3. Add Item: False (The logs do not show any explicit "Add Item" event. However, some actions like scrolling through pages could imply browsing items, but there's no direct evidence of adding an item to the cart.)

4. Modify Cart: False (Similar to the previous points, the logs do not show any explicit "Modify Cart" event. Actions like scrolling or clicking on items might suggest browsing the cart, but no modifications were observed.)

5. Place Order: False (No "Place Order" event was found in the logs. The actions seen are mainly navigation and possibly item browsing, but there's no indication of placing an order.)
