Model used: mistral:7b
Prompt: Analyze the log file. For each required core event
(Login, Registration, Add Item, Modify Cart, Place Order, etc.),
check if it was explicitly completed in the logs.
Mark each event as True (completed) or False (not completed).
==================================================

1. Login: True - The log shows a "Restaurant Login" click event followed by multiple user interactions on the login page, indicating a successful login.

2. Registration: False - There is no evidence of a registration event in the provided logs.

3. Add Item: Indeterminate - While the logs show user interactions with various elements on the page (clicks and inputs), it's not clear whether these actions correspond to adding an item to the cart or not. More context would be needed to confirm this event.

4. Modify Cart: Indeterminate - As with "Add Item", there is insufficient information in the logs to definitively say whether a modify cart event occurred. User interactions with the cart page might indicate this, but the provided logs do not show any such actions.

5. Place Order: False - There is no evidence of a place order event in the logs. The user interactions seen in the logs appear to be focused on the login and navigation areas, with no indication of placing an order.
