Prompt: Analyze the log file. For each required core event
(Login, Registration, Add Item, Modify Cart, Place Order, etc.),
check if it was explicitly completed in the logs.
Mark each event as True (completed) or False (not completed).
==================================================

1. Login: False - The logs do not show any explicit login event. However, they do show a click on a link leading to the login page, but no subsequent event indicating successful login.

2. Registration: False - There is no evidence of registration in these logs.

3. Add Item: Not Possible to Determine - The logs do not contain any information about adding items to a cart or inventory.

4. Modify Cart: Not Possible to Determine - There is no data showing the modification of a cart, such as changing quantities or removing items.

5. Place Order: False - The logs do not show any explicit place order event. However, they do show multiple clicks on different elements related to a restaurant, but no subsequent action that could be interpreted as placing an order.

6. Other possible events (View Menu, View Profile, Logout):

   - View Menu: True - There is a click event on the "Restaurant Partners" link, which likely leads to the menu page.

   - View Profile: Not Possible to Determine - The logs do not contain any information about viewing a profile.

   - Logout: False - The logs do not show any explicit logout event. However, based on the lack of subsequent interactions with the application, it's possible that the user may have logged out implicitly (e.g., by closing the browser).
