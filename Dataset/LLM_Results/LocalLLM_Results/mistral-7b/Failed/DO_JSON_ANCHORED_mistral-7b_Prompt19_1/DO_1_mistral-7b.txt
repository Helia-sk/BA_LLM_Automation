Model used: mistral:7b
Prompt: Analyze the log file. For each required core event
(Login, Registration, Add Item, Modify Cart, Place Order, etc.),
check if it was explicitly completed in the logs.
Mark each event as True (completed) or False (not completed).
==================================================

1. Login: True (The user clicked on "Customer Login" and subsequently interacted with other elements that suggest a successful login.)

2. Registration: False (There is no evidence of registration in these logs as the actions shown are those of a logged-in user.)

3. Add Item: Depends (The logs show the user interacting with the UI, but it's unclear whether any items were added to the cart or not. More information about the application's functionality is needed to make this determination.)

4. Modify Cart: Depends (As with "Add Item", the user interacts with the UI in a way that suggests they might be modifying their cart, but it's unclear whether any changes were saved or not. More information about the application's functionality is needed to make this determination.)

5. Place Order: False (There is no evidence of an order being placed in these logs. The actions shown are those of a logged-in user browsing the site, but there is no indication that they proceeded to checkout or complete an order.)
