Model used: mistral:7b
Prompt: Analyze the log file. For each required core event
(Login, Registration, Add Item, Modify Cart, Place Order, etc.),
check if it was explicitly completed in the logs.
Mark each event as True (completed) or False (not completed).
==================================================

1. Login: True - The log shows a "click" event on the "Restaurant Login" link, followed by a "click" event on the username input field, which suggests a login attempt was made. However, there is no explicit "Login Successful" event in the logs, but the subsequent events (interactions with the dashboard) suggest that the login was successful.

2. Registration: False - There are no indications of any registration-related events in the provided log file.

3. Add Item: Not Determined - Although there are several clicks on various elements, it's not clear whether these clicks were related to adding an item to the cart or not. More context about the website structure and user interactions would be needed to make this determination.

4. Modify Cart: Not Determined - As with the "Add Item" event, there are several clicks on elements in the dashboard, but it's unclear whether these actions were related to modifying the cart or not. More context about the website structure and user interactions would be needed to make this determination.

5. Place Order: Not Determined - There are no indications of any order-related events in the provided log file, such as a "Place Order" button click or an API request for order creation. However, since the user interacted with the dashboard after the login, it's possible that placing an order was the intended action. More context about the website structure and user interactions would be needed to make this determination.
