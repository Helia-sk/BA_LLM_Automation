Prompt: Analyze the log file. For each required core event
(Login, Registration, Add Item, Modify Cart, Place Order, etc.),
check if it was explicitly completed in the logs.
Mark each event as True (completed) or False (not completed).
==================================================

1. Login: True (The logs show two separate login events for both "Restaurant Login" and "Customer Login")
2. Registration: False (There is no explicit registration event in the logs)
3. Add Item: False (No explicit add item event found in the logs)
4. Modify Cart: False (No explicit modify cart event found in the logs)
5. Place Order: False (No explicit place order event found in the logs)
6. Other Events: It is not possible to determine if other events like navigation, search, or error occurred as there are no corresponding events in the provided logs.
