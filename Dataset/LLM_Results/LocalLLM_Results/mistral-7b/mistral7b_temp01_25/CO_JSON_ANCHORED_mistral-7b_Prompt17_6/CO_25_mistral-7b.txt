==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user initiated a task (clicking on the "Menu" link) but did not complete any other tasks related to the menu page. Specifically, there is no evidence of any interaction with the menu items or any other elements on the menu page that would indicate a completion of a task.

   User Journey:
   1) [Step 1] The user navigated to the restaurant dashboard page (URL: http://localhost:5173/restaurant/dashboard/menu).
   2) [Step 2] The user scrolled down the page (event: scroll).
   3) [Step 3] The user clicked on the "Menu" link (event: click). However, there is no further interaction with any other elements on the menu page, indicating that the user did not complete any tasks related to the menu.
   Note: It's important to consider all logs before making a decision. In this case, even though the user scrolled down the page, it does not indicate completion of a task as there is no evidence of interaction with the menu items or other elements on the menu page. The absence of such interactions suggests that the user did not find what they were looking for and left the page, hence tagging this session as a drop-off.
