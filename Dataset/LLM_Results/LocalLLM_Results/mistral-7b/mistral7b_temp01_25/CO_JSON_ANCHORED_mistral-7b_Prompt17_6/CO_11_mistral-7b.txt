==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off

   Reason: The user initiated a task (scrolling down the page) but did not complete it, as indicated by the subsequent scroll events. However, since no other tasks were initiated and completed, we cannot definitively classify this session as a conversion.

   1) [Step 1] The user started a new session on the customer dashboard page (/customer/dashboard).
   2) [Step 2] The user scrolled down the page to a height of approximately 310 pixels from the top.
   3) [Step 3] The user continued scrolling down the page, reaching heights of approximately 560 and 740 pixels from the top.
   4) [Step 4] The user scrolled further down the page, but no subsequent scroll events were recorded, indicating that the user may have stopped scrolling or left the page.
   5) [Step 5] No other tasks were initiated or completed during this session, suggesting that the user did not interact with any other elements on the page.
   It is important to note that while the user scrolled down the page multiple times, no other tasks were initiated or completed, which is a key factor in classifying this session as a drop-off.
