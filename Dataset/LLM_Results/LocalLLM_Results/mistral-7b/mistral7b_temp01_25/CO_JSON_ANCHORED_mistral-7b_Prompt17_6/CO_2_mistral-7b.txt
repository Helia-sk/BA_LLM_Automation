==================================================

 Tag: Conversion

   Reason: The user initiated a click on the "Customer Login" link, which was followed by clicking the "Already have an account? Sign in" button. After that, the user clicked on the username input field and then started typing (indicated by the "debounce" event). This indicates that the user is actively engaging with the login form, suggesting a conversion.

   1) The user landed on the customer login page.
   2) The user clicked on the "Customer Login" link.
   3) The user clicked on the "Already have an account? Sign in" button.
   4) The user clicked on the username input field, indicating they are ready to enter their username.
   5) The user started typing, suggesting they are entering their username (indicated by the "debounce" event).
   Note: All initiated tasks were completed, so the session is classified as a conversion.

   To ensure all logs have been considered, here's a summary of the remaining logs:
   6) The user clicked outside the username input field, possibly to move the cursor or focus on another element.
   7) The user did not perform any further actions related to the login process, such as clicking the password input field or submitting the form.
   These additional logs do not change the classification of the session, as all necessary tasks for a conversion were completed earlier in the user journey.
