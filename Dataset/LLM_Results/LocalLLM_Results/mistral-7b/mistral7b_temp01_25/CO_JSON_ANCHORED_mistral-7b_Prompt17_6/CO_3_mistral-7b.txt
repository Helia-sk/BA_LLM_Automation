 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user initiated the task of logging in to the restaurant, but did not complete it by entering a username. Instead, they clicked on an unrelated link labeled "Restaurant Login", which suggests that they may have been confused or had an unexpected intention. However, since we do not have information about subsequent actions, this is an assumption and further logs might provide more context.

  1) [Step 1] The user navigated to the restaurant login page.
  2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the username input field, indicating they intended to enter their username.
  3) [Step 3] Instead of entering a username, the user clicked on an unrelated link labeled "Restaurant Login", which does not seem to be part of the login process. This action suggests that the user may have been confused or had an unexpected intention.
  4) [Step 4] The user did not take any further actions related to the login process, indicating they abandoned the task.

Since we do not have information about subsequent actions, this is an assumption and further logs might provide more context.
