 Tag: Conversion

   Reason: The user initiated a task (clicking on the "Restaurant Partners" link) and completed it by registering or logging in (as indicated by the subsequent clicks on the username input field). This was followed by another task, navigating away from the dashboard to the homepage, which is typically not the final step in a conversion funnel but does not necessarily indicate a drop-off. The user then returned to the restaurant login page, suggesting they were either troubleshooting an issue or revisiting the page for some reason, and finally completed the registration/login process.
