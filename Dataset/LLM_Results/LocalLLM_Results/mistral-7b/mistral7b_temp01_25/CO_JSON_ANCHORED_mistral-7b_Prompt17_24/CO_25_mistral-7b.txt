==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user initiated a task (clicking on the "Menu" link) but did not complete it, instead scrolling and clicking elsewhere on the page. This indicates that the user may have left the site without completing their intended action.

   User Journey:
   1) [Step 1] The user accessed the restaurant's dashboard at http://localhost:5173/restaurant/dashboard/menu.
   2) [Step 2] The user scrolled down the page to position (x:0, y:81).
   3) [Step 3] The user clicked on an element with class "flex items-center px-3 py-2 rounded-md text-sm font-medium whitespace-nowrap bg-orange-500 text-white" and id "", which was the "Menu" link.
   4) [Step 4] The user then scrolled further down the page to position (x:0, y:588), indicating they were exploring the site.
   5) [Step 5] The user clicked on an element with tagName "svg", which was not a part of the intended user journey and suggests that the user may have navigated away from the intended path.
   Since the user did not complete the intended task (clicking on the "Menu" link), the session can be classified as a drop-off.
