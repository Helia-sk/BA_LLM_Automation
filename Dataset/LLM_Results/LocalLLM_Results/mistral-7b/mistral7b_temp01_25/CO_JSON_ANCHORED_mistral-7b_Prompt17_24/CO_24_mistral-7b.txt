==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user initiated a task (clicking on the "Menu" link) but did not complete it. Instead, they clicked on various other elements on the page without interacting with the form to upload an image or create/edit a menu item.

   1) [Step 1] The user accessed the restaurant dashboard at http://localhost:5173/restaurant/dashboard/menu.
   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "Menu" link located at x = 586, y = 124.
   3) [Step 3] The user hovered over an SVG element located at x = 664, y = 338 but did not click on it.
   4) [Step 4] The user clicked on the "ImageDrag image here or click to upload" text within a form.
   5) [Step 5] The user clicked on the form itself at x = 889, y = 695 but did not interact with any of the input fields within the form.
   6) [Step 6] The user clicked on various elements within the page (x = 664, y = 338, x = 889, y = 695, etc.) without completing any tasks or interacting with the intended form.
   Note: The log file does not show any interaction with the "Save Changes" or "Cancel" buttons within the form, indicating that the user did not complete the task of creating/editing a menu item.

   I have considered all the logs in my decision making process. The user initiated a task (clicking on the "Menu" link) but did not complete it, which classifies this session as a drop-off.
