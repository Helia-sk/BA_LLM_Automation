 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user initiated a task (clicked on "History") but did not complete it by clicking on any of the subsequent options. Instead, they clicked on the "Reject" button, which suggests that they were not satisfied with the information presented and chose to leave the platform without further interaction.

  1) [Step 1] The user navigated to the restaurant dashboard page (/restaurant/dashboard).
  2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "History" link, indicating an interest in viewing the history of transactions or events related to the restaurant.
  3) [Step 3] The user clicked on the "Reject" button, which is typically used when a user wants to discard or cancel an action. In this case, it seems that the user was not interested in the history details presented and chose to leave the platform without further interaction.
  4) [Step 4] The user navigated away from the restaurant dashboard page (/restaurant/dashboard), indicating that they have left the platform.

   All initiated tasks were not completed, so the session was classified as a drop-off. It is essential to consider all logs to ensure an accurate classification and to gain insights into user behavior for future improvements.
