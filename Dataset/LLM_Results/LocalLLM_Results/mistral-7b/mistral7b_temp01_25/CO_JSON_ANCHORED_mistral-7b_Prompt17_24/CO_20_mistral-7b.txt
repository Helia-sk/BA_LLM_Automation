 Tag: Conversion

   Reason: The user initiated a task (clicking on the "Hungry? Order delicious food from local restaurants" link) and then returned to the login form, indicating that they were not immediately leaving the site. After clicking on the login form, they proceeded to fill out their username and password fields, which are the final steps required for a successful login.

   1) The user landed on the homepage (/customer/login).
   2) The user clicked on the "Hungry? Order delicious food from local restaurants" link, indicating an interest in ordering food.
   3) The user navigated back to the login form by clicking on it.
   4) The user entered their username in the username field.
   5) The user entered their password in the password field.
   6) The user clicked on the submit button, successfully logging into the site.

   All initiated tasks (landing on the homepage and ordering food) were completed, so the session is classified as a conversion.
