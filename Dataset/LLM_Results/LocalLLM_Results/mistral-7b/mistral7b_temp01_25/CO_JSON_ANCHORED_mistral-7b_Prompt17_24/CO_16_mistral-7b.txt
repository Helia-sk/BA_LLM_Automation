 Tag: Conversion

   Reason: All initiated tasks in this session were completed. The user clicked on the "Customer Login" link, which led to the username input field being clicked twice (possibly to focus and type the username), then the password input field was clicked once (to focus and type the password), and finally the login button was clicked to submit the form.

   1) [Step 1] The user navigated to the homepage ("http://localhost:5173/").
   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "Customer Login" link, which took them to the login page.
   3) [Step 3] The user clicked on the username input field twice (possibly to focus and type the username).
   4) [Step 4] The user clicked on the password input field once (to focus and type the password).
   5) [Step 5] The user clicked on the login button to submit the form.
   I have considered all the logs in this session, as they provide a clear sequence of events leading to the completion of the initiated task (logging in).
