==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user initiated tasks (clicking on the "Restaurant Partners" link and filling in the username field), but did not complete the task of entering a password or clicking the login button, indicating that they abandoned the process before completing the login.

  1) [Step 1] User navigated to the restaurant login page by clicking on the "Restaurant Partners" link.
  2) [Step 2] User clicked on the username input field to enter their username.
  3) [Step 3] User entered a username ("User1") and clicked outside of the input field, presumably to move on to the next step (entering a password).
  4) [Step 4] The user did not click on the password input field or the login button, indicating that they abandoned the process.

All initiated tasks were considered in this analysis. The user started the login process but did not complete it, so the session was classified as a drop-off.
