   2) [Step 2] User clicked on the "Customer Login" link located at the top right corner of the homepage.
   3) [Step 3] User clicked on the login form, but did not enter any username or password.
   4) [Step 4] User left the page by clicking outside the login form.

The user initiated a task (logging in as a customer), but they did not complete it, so this session is considered a drop-off. All logs were reviewed to ensure that no tasks were missed or overlooked.
