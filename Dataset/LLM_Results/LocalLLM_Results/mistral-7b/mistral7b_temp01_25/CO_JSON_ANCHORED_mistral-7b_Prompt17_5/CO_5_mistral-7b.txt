 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user initiated a task (clicking on "Customer Login") but did not complete it, indicating that they left the site without completing the intended action.

   1) [Step 1] User navigated to the homepage ("http://localhost:5173/").
   2) [Step 2] User scrolled down the page ("scroll" event).
   3) [Step 3] User clicked on "Customer Login" button.
   4) [Step 4] User scrolled again (indicating they were still on the page, but did not complete any further actions, such as filling out a form or clicking submit, which would indicate a conversion).
   5) [Step 5] The session ended without any further interaction from the user.

It is important to note that all logs have been considered in this analysis. The user initiated a task (clicking on "Customer Login"), but did not complete it, indicating a drop-off. If the user had completed the intended action (such as filling out a form or clicking submit), this would be classified as a conversion.
