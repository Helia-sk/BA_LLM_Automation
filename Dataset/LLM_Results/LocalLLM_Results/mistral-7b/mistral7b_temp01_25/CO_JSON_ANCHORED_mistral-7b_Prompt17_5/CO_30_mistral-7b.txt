==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user initiated a task (clicked on "History") but did not complete it by clicking on any of the subsequent options. Instead, they clicked on the "Reject" button, indicating that they chose to leave without completing the intended action.

   1) [Step 1] The user navigated to the restaurant dashboard page (/restaurant/dashboard).
   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "History" option located at x = 676, y = 126.
   3) [Step 3] The user clicked on the "Reject" button located at x = 1538, y = 298. This action indicates that they chose to leave without viewing the details of any history item.
   Note: Although the user did not complete all initiated tasks, it is important to consider every log in the analysis. The user also clicked on other elements such as the "View Details" button and the "History" link, but these actions were not part of the intended conversion path (viewing a history item's details). Therefore, these clicks do not affect the classification of this session as a drop-off.
