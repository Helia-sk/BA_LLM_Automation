==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user initiated a task (clicking on "History") but did not complete it by clicking on "View Details". This indicates that the user abandoned the task before completion.

   1) [Step 1] The user accessed the restaurant dashboard page.
   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "History" link to view the order history.
   3) [Step 3] The user did not click on the "View Details" button for any of the orders in the history, indicating that they did not want to view the details of their previous orders.
   At this point, it appears that the user has left the page without completing any further tasks, suggesting a drop-off. However, it's important to note that the log file does not provide information about subsequent actions the user might have taken after leaving this specific page or session. Therefore, it's possible that the user returned later and completed some tasks, but based on the provided logs, we can only classify this as a drop-off for now.
