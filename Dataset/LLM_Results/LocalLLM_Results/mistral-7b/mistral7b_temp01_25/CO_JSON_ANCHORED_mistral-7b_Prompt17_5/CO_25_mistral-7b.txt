==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user initiated a task (clicking on the "Menu" link) but did not complete it, instead scrolling and clicking elsewhere on the page. This indicates that the user did not find what they were looking for in the menu or got distracted by other elements on the page.

   1) [Step 1] The user accessed the restaurant dashboard page (/restaurant/dashboard/menu).
   2) [Step 2] The user scrolled down the page to position (x: 0, y: 81).
   3) [Step 3] The user clicked on an element at position (x: 571, y: 125), which was likely a link to the menu.
   4) [Step 4] The user then scrolled further down the page to position (x: 0, y: 911).
   5) [Step 5] The user clicked on another element at position (x: 1134, y: 588), which was not part of the menu or any other initiated task. This indicates that the user did not complete the task of viewing the menu and got distracted by other elements on the page.
   Note: The log file does not contain information about subsequent actions taken by the user, so it is not possible to determine if the user returned to the menu or completed any other tasks before leaving the page. However, based on the available logs, the session can be classified as a drop-off since the initiated task (viewing the menu) was abandoned.
