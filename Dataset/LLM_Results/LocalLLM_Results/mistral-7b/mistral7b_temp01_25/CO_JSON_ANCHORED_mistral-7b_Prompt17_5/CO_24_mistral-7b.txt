   2) [Step 2] User clicked on the "Menu" link located at x = 586, y = 124.
   3) [Step 3] User hovered over an SVG element located at x = 664, y = 338 but did not click or interact with it further.
   4) [Step 4] User clicked on the "ImageDrag image here or click to upload" area within a form, but no further interaction was recorded for this form.
   5) [Step 5] User clicked on the form itself, but again, no further interaction was recorded.
   6) [Step 6] User did not interact with any other elements within the logged session, indicating that they may have left the page or closed the browser.
