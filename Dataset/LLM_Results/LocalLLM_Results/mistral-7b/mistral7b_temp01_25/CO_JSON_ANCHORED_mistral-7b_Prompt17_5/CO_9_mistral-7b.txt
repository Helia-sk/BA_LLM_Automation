==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user initiated a task (scrolling down the page) but did not complete it, indicating that they left the page without completing any of the tasks.

   1) [Step 1] The user accessed the homepage at "http://localhost:5173/customer/dashboard".
   2) [Step 2] The user scrolled down the page (log_1757773978615_bwt5ki2v4).
   3) [Step 3] The user scrolled further down the page (log_1757773978718_dw1dc2kpq).
   4) [Step 4] The user clicked on an image (no image available, log_1757773978615_bwt5ki2v4), but this does not seem to be a link to another page or task.
   5) [Step 5] The user scrolled down the page again (log_1757773977591_3etisigwv).
   However, the user did not initiate any other tasks that could be considered as completing a conversion, such as clicking on a link to another page or filling out a form. Therefore, this session was a drop-off.

   I have considered all the logs provided in the log file for my decision making.
