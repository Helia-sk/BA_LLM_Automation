 Tag: Conversion

   Reason: The user initiated a task (clicking on "Settings") and completed it by performing subsequent tasks (clicking on "Add", interacting with an input field, typing something into the input field, clicking on another "Add" button, and finally clicking on the "Submit" button). Since all initiated tasks were completed, this session can be classified as a conversion.

   1) The user clicked on the "Settings" link from the dashboard.
   2) The user clicked on the "Add" button to initiate adding a new item.
   3) The user interacted with an input field, indicating they were entering data for the new item.
   4) The user typed something into the input field (although we don't know what exactly, it can be inferred that the user provided some information).
   5) The user clicked on another "Add" button to confirm adding the new item.
   6) The user clicked on the "Submit" button to save their changes.

   All logs were considered in this analysis.
