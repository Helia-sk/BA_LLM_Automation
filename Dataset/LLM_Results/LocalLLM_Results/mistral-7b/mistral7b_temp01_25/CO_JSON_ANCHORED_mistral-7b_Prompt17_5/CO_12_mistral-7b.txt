 Tag: Conversion

   Reason: The user initiated a task (clicking on the "Menu" link) and completed it by navigating to the "Menu" page. After that, the user initiated another task (clicking on the "Add Item" button), which is an action typically associated with adding a new item to the menu. Since this task was also completed, we can conclude that the session resulted in a conversion.
