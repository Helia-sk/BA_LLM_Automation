==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user initiated a task (clicked on "History") but did not complete it by clicking on any of the subsequent options. Instead, they clicked on the "Reject" button, indicating that they abandoned the task.

   1) [Step 1] The user navigated to the restaurant dashboard page ("/restaurant/dashboard").
   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "History" link located at x = 676, y = 126.
   3) [Step 3] The user clicked on the "Reject" button located at x = 1538, y = 298. This action indicates that they did not want to view the details of any history item, and thus abandoned the task initiated by clicking on the "History" link.
   4) [Step 4] The user clicked on the "Reject" button again located at x = 1538, y = 298. This action further confirms that they did not want to view any details.
   5) [Step 5] The user clicked on the "History" link once more, but this time they clicked on the "Reject" button again instead of exploring the history items.
   6) [Step 6] The user navigated away from the page by clicking elsewhere or closing the tab/window.

In this log file, all initiated tasks were not completed, so the session was a drop-off. It is important to consider every log in the analysis to ensure accuracy.
