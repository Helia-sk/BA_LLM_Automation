   2) The user clicked on the "Restaurant Partners" link, indicating an intention to register or log in.
   3) The user clicked on the "Register your restaurant or log in to manage orders" link, suggesting that they intended to either register a new account or log in to an existing one.
   4) The user entered their username and password, indicating that they were logging in to an existing account.
   5) The user was navigated to the dashboard ("http://localhost:5173/restaurant/dashboard"), confirming a successful login.
