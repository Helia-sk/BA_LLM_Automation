 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user initiated a task (clicking on the "Menu" link) but did not complete any of the subsequent tasks such as uploading an image, filling out the form for adding a new menu item, or clicking on any other interactive elements within the logged session.

   1) [Step 1] User navigated to the restaurant dashboard page (http://localhost:5173/restaurant/dashboard/menu).
   2) [Step 2] User clicked on the "Menu" link located at x = 586, y = 124.
   3) [Step 3] User hovered over an SVG element located at x = 664, y = 338 but did not click or interact with it further.
   4) [Step 4] User clicked on the "ImageDrag image here or click to upload" area within a form, but did not actually drag or upload an image.
   5) [Step 5] User clicked on the form itself, but did not fill out any of the fields (Name, Description, Category, Price, etc.).
   6) [Step 6] User clicked outside the form to cancel changes without saving them.
   The user did not complete any of the initiated tasks, so the session is classified as a drop-off. It's important to note that this analysis is based on the provided logs and does not consider any additional context or user behavior outside of these logs.
