 Tag: Drop-Off

   Reason: The user initiated tasks by clicking on "Balance", then "Orders", but did not complete any of those tasks. Instead, they clicked on "View Details" under Orders and then closed the session by clicking on "Orders" again. Since one of the initiated tasks (viewing order details) was abandoned, the session can be classified as a drop-off.

   1) The user started the session by visiting the customer dashboard.
   2) The user clicked on the "Balance" link but did not proceed further.
   3) The user then clicked on the "Orders" link.
   4) The user initiated the task of viewing order details by clicking on "View Details" under Orders.
   5) The user abandoned this task by clicking on "Orders" again, indicating they did not complete the view order details task.
   6) The user closed the session without completing any other tasks.

   It is important to note that all logs were considered in making this decision.
