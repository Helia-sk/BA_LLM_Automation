==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user initiated the task of logging into the restaurant (click on "Restaurant Login") but did not complete it by entering a username. Instead, they clicked on the username input field and then left the page without entering any information. This indicates that the user did not complete the intended action, which was to log in, so we classify this session as a drop-off.

   User Journey:
   1) [Step 1] The user navigated to the restaurant login page by clicking on the "Restaurant Login" link.
   2) [Step 2] Upon reaching the login page, the user clicked on the username input field.
   3) [Step 3] However, the user did not enter any information in the username field and instead left the page without completing the login process. This indicates a drop-off as the intended action (logging in) was not completed.
