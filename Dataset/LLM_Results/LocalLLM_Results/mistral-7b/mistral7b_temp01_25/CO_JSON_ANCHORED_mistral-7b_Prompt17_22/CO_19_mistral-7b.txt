 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user initiated a task (clicking on "Customer Login") but did not complete it, as indicated by the subsequent logs showing navigation away from the login page. This suggests that the user did not proceed with the intended action of logging in.

  1) [Step 1] User navigated to the restaurant dashboard settings page ("/restaurant/dashboard/settings").
  2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "Customer Login" link, indicating an intention to log in.
  3) [Step 3] The user navigated away from the login page to a different URL ("http://localhost:5173/"), suggesting that they did not complete the login process.
  4) [Step 4] The user clicked on an input field for the username, but no further logs indicate any action related to entering a password or submitting the login form.
  5) [Step 5] The user clicked on another element on the page (the input field for the username), but again, no subsequent logs suggest that they completed the intended action.
  6) [Step 6] The user viewed the login page ("page_view" event), indicating that they may have returned to the page, but no further actions related to logging in were recorded.

   All initiated tasks (clicking on "Customer Login" and interacting with the username input field) were not completed, so the session was classified as a drop-off. It is important to note that all logs were considered in this decision.
