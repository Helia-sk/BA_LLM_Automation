 Tag: Conversion

   Reason: The user initiated a task (clicking on "Add Item") and completed it by clicking on the specific item ("Saladmixvery healthy€0.08"). This indicates that the user has successfully added an item to their cart, which is one of the tasks required for a conversion in this context.

   1) [Step 1] The user accessed the restaurant's dashboard menu page (http://localhost:5173/restaurant/dashboard/menu).
   2) [Step 2] The user scrolled through the menu items and clicked on the "Add Item" button.
   3) [Step 3] The user selected a specific item ("Saladmixvery healthy€0.08") from the list of items to add.
   4) [Step 4] The user confirmed the addition of the item by clicking on it again, which indicates successful addition to the cart.

   All the logs provided in the log file were considered in this decision making process. The user initiated a task (adding an item to the cart), completed it, and no other tasks were abandoned, hence the session was classified as a conversion.
