==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user initiated tasks by clicking on "Balance", but did not complete any of the subsequent tasks such as "View Details" or navigating to "Orders". This indicates that the session was abandoned.

   User Journey:
   1) [Step 1] The user clicked on the "Balance" link, indicating an interest in checking their account balance.
   2) [Step 2] No further actions were taken related to the balance page, suggesting that the user did not find what they were looking for or decided against proceeding.
   3) [Step 3] The user then clicked on the "Orders" link, potentially hoping to find more information or make a purchase.
   4) [Step 4] However, the user did not click on the "View Details" button for any of the orders listed, nor did they perform any other actions related to the orders page.
   5) [Step 5] The session ended with the user clicking on the "Orders" link again, which could indicate confusion or a change of mind, but no further actions were taken after this.
   It is important to note that while the user did not complete any tasks related to orders or balance, they may have performed other actions outside of the scope of these logs, such as navigating to different pages or interacting with the site in other ways. However, based on the provided logs, it appears that this session was a drop-off.
