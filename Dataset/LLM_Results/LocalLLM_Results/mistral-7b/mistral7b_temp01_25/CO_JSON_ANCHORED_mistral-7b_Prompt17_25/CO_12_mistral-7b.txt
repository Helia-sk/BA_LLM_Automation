 Tag: Conversion

   Reason: The user initiated a task (clicking on the "Menu" link) and completed it by navigating to the "menu" page. After that, the user initiated another task (clicking on the "Add Item" button), which is considered a conversion action in this context as it indicates adding an item to the menu. The user did not abandon any of the initiated tasks, so the session can be classified as a conversion.
