==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user initiated a task (clicking on the "Customer Login" link) but did not complete it by entering their username and password. This indicates that they abandoned the session before completing the login process.

  1) [Step 1] User navigated to the homepage of the website.
  2) [Step 2] User clicked on the "Customer Login" link located at the top right corner of the page.
  3) [Step 3] User clicked on the username input field but did not enter any text, indicating they may have intended to type their username but did not.
  4) [Step 4] User clicked outside the username input field, which suggests they might have decided to leave the page without entering their password.
  5) [Step 5] The user did not perform any further actions on the website, indicating that they abandoned the session.

All initiated tasks were considered in this analysis, and it was determined that the session was a drop-off because one of the initiated tasks (the login process) was abandoned by the user.
