 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user initiated the task of clicking on the "Customer Login" button, but did not complete the subsequent tasks such as entering a username and password. This indicates that the user abandoned the session before completing the login process.

   User Journey:
   1) [Step 1] The user navigated to the homepage of the website (URL: http://localhost:5173/).
   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "Customer Login" button located at the bottom left corner of the page (x: 627, y: 38).
   3) [Step 3] The user navigated to the login page (URL: http://localhost:5173/customer/login).
   4) [Step 4] The user clicked on the username input field (x: 563, y: 289). This action indicates that the user intended to enter a username. However, no further logs show the user entering any text into this field, suggesting that they abandoned the task.
   5) [Step 5] The user clicked on the password input field (x: 563, y: 349). This action also indicates an intention to enter a password, but again, no further logs show the user entering any text into this field, suggesting that they abandoned the task.
   6) [Step 6] The user did not perform any other actions on the page, indicating that they left the website without completing the login process. This confirms that the session was a drop-off.
