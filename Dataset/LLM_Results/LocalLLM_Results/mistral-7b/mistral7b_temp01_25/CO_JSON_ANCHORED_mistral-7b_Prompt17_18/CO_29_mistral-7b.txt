 Tag: Conversion

   Reason: The user initiated two tasks (clicking on "History" and then clicking on "View Details") and completed both of them. This indicates that the user was engaged with the application until the end, which is a characteristic of a conversion.

   1) [Step 1] The user clicked on the "History" button on the dashboard.
   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "View Details" button for one of the history items.
   3) [Step 3] No further actions were recorded, indicating that the user did not abandon the application after viewing the details. This suggests that the user's interaction ended naturally, which is consistent with a conversion.

   All the logs provided in the log file have been considered to reach this conclusion.
