 Tag: Conversion

   Reason: The user initiated the task of navigating to the Customer Login page (log 10), clicked on the "Customer Login" button (log 11), and then interacted with the username input field by clicking it twice (logs 18 and 34) and entering a username (logs 35 and 36). This indicates that the user completed all initiated tasks, so the session can be classified as a conversion.

   1) The user navigated to the homepage (log 1).
   2) The user clicked on the "Customer Login" link located at the top right corner of the page (log 10).
   3) The user clicked on the "Customer Login" button (log 11).
   4) The user interacted with the username input field by clicking it twice (logs 18 and 34) and entered a username (logs 35 and 36).

   I have considered all the logs in my decision making.
