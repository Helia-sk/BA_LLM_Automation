 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user initiated tasks by clicking on "Balance" and then "Orders", but did not complete any of these tasks. Instead, they clicked on "Orders" again, which suggests that they might have been confused or lost interest in the previous task. After that, they clicked on "View Details" under Orders, but did not proceed further, indicating an abandonment of this task as well.

  1) [Step 1] The user started the session by clicking on the "Balance" link.
  2) [Step 2] The user then navigated to the "Orders" section by clicking on the corresponding link.
  3) [Step 3] The user clicked on "Orders" again, possibly due to confusion or curiosity.
  4) [Step 4] The user clicked on "View Details" under Orders, but did not proceed further, suggesting an abandonment of this task.
  5) [Step 5] The session ended without any other interactions, indicating a drop-off.

   It is important to note that all the logs were considered in making this decision. The user initiated tasks but did not complete any of them, which meets the criteria for a drop-off.
