 Tag: Conversion

   Reason: The user initiated a task (scrolling down the page) and completed it by scrolling to the bottom of the page. After that, the user clicked on an element (the "No image available" div), which can be considered as another task. Since all initiated tasks were completed, this session is classified as a conversion.

   1) The user landed on the homepage ("/customer/dashboard").
   2) The user scrolled down the page to view the content (scroll event).
   3) The user clicked on an element within the content (the "No image available" div).
   4) The user continued scrolling down the page, indicating they were still interacting with the content (another scroll event).
   5) The user scrolled to the bottom of the page, which suggests they have consumed all the content or found what they were looking for. This could be considered as a completion of the main task (browsing through the content).
   6) Since no other actions were recorded after this, it is reasonable to assume that the user left the site, but since all initiated tasks were completed, this session is classified as a conversion.
