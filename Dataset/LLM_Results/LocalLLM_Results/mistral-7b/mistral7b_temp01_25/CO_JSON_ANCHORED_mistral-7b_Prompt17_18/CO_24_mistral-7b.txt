==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user initiated a task (clicking on the "Menu" link) but did not complete it. Instead, they clicked on various other elements on the page without interacting with the form to upload an image or create/edit a menu item.

   1) [Step 1] User navigated to the restaurant dashboard page ("http://localhost:5173/restaurant/dashboard/menu").
   2) [Step 2] User clicked on the "Menu" link, indicating an intention to interact with the menu management system.
   3) [Step 3] User clicked on the SVG element without any apparent purpose.
   4) [Step 4] User clicked on the form containing the image drag and drop area and the upload/cancel/save buttons but did not interact with these elements.
   5) [Step 5] User clicked on various other elements within the form, suggesting exploration rather than intent to complete a task.
   6) [Step 6] User clicked outside the form without any interaction with it, indicating they may have lost interest or were distracted.
   It appears that all initiated tasks were not completed, so the session was classified as a drop-off. The user journey ended without any interaction with the intended task (managing the menu).
