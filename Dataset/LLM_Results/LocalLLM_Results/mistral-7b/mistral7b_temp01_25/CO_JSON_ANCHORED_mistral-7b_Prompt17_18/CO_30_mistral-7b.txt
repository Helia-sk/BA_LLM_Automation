==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user initiated a task (clicked on "History") but did not complete it by clicking on any of the subsequent options. Instead, they clicked on the "Reject" button, which suggests that they were not satisfied with the information presented and decided to leave the platform without completing their intended action.

  1) [Step 1] The user navigated to the restaurant dashboard page (/restaurant/dashboard).
  2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "History" option, indicating an interest in viewing the history of transactions or events related to the restaurant.
  3) [Step 3] The user clicked on the "Reject" button, which suggests that they were not satisfied with the information presented about the history and decided to leave the platform without completing their intended action (viewing the details).
  4) [Step 4] The user navigated away from the restaurant dashboard page by clicking on another link or closing the browser tab.

   I have considered all the logs provided in this response, as they provide a clear sequence of actions taken by the user during their session.
