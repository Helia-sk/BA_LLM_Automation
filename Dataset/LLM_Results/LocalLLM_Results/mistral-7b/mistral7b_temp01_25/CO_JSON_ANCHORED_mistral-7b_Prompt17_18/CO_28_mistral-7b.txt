==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user initiated a login process (form_submit event), but did not complete any further tasks in the session. Specifically, the user clicked on the "Sign In" button, entered their credentials, and then did not proceed to any other initiated tasks such as clicking on the "Sign Up" button or navigating to the dashboard page.

  1) [Step 1] The user visited the restaurant's website (URL not specified in the logs).
  2) [Step 2] The user navigated to the login page by clicking on the "Sign In" button.
  3) [Step 3] The user entered their credentials into the username and password fields.
  4) [Step 4] The user clicked on the "Sign In" button to submit their login details, but did not proceed to any other initiated tasks in the session.

   I have considered all the logs provided in the question, as they cover the entire session from the initial visit to the website until the user's last action (clicking on the "Sign In" button). The absence of further actions indicates that the session was a drop-off.
