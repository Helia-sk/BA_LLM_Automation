==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user initiated a task (clicking on the "Customer Login" link) but did not complete it by entering their username and password, which indicates that they abandoned the process.

   1) [Step 1] The user navigated to the homepage of the website.
   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "Customer Login" link located at the top right corner of the page.
   3) [Step 3] The user clicked on the username input field, but did not enter any text or perform any other action related to the login process.
   4) [Step 4] The user clicked outside the username input field, which suggests that they might have decided to leave the page without completing the login process.
   Note: Although the user clicked on the "Username" input field and the "Form" containing the login fields, these actions do not count as completed tasks since the user did not provide any valid input or submit the form.
   Check if you considered all the logs to the end: Yes, I have reviewed all the provided logs and made a decision based on the initiated and abandoned tasks.
