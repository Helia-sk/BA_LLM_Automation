==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user initiated tasks by clicking on "Balance" and then "Orders", but did not complete any of these tasks. Instead, they clicked on "Orders" again, which indicates that they might have wanted to go back to the previous page or explore more options without completing the task.

  1) [Step 1] The user started a new session by accessing the customer dashboard.
  2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "Balance" link, indicating an interest in checking their account balance.
  3) [Step 3] The user then clicked on the "Orders" link, suggesting they wanted to view their order history.
  4) [Step 4] Instead of viewing their orders, the user clicked on the "Orders" link again, which could indicate confusion or a change in intent.
  5) [Step 5] The user clicked on the "View Details" button for an order, but did not proceed further, suggesting they might have decided to abandon this task.
  6) [Step 6] The user clicked on the "Orders" link again, which could indicate a desire to explore more options or reconsider their previous actions. However, since we don't have subsequent logs to confirm if they completed any tasks after this, we can't be sure.
  7) [Step 7] The user clicked on the "Cart" link, indicating another potential interest or intent, but without further logs, we cannot determine if this was completed or not.

   It is important to note that while the user did initiate tasks, they did not complete any of them, which leads us to classify this session as a drop-off. However, since the session ended without all logs being recorded, it's possible that the user might have completed some tasks after the last logged event, but we cannot confirm this with the provided data.
