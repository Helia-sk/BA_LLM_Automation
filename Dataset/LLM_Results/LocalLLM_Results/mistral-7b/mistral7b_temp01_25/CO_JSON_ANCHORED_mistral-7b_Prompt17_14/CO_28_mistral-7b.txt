==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user initiated a login process (form_submit event), but did not complete any further tasks in the session. Specifically, the user clicked on the "Sign In" button, entered their credentials, and then left the site without performing any other actions that could be considered part of the intended user journey.

   User Journey:
   1) [Step 1] The user navigated to the restaurant's login page (/restaurant/login).
   2) [Step 2] The user entered their username and password, but did not provide any actual values (input_change events for both username and password fields).
   3) [Step 3] The user submitted the form by clicking the "Sign In" button (form_submit event), indicating an attempt to log in.
   4) [Step 4] After submitting the form, the user did not perform any further actions that could be considered part of the intended user journey, such as navigating to a different page or interacting with site elements. Instead, they left the site (implied by the absence of any subsequent events in the log).
   Note: All initiated tasks were not completed, so the session was classified as a drop-off.
