 Tag: Conversion

   Reason: The user initiated the task of logging in by clicking on the "UsernamePasswordSign In" button, and then proceeded to click on both the username and password input fields, indicating that they are entering their login credentials. Finally, they clicked the submit button, which would typically complete the login process if the credentials were correct. Since all initiated tasks were completed, this session can be classified as a conversion.
