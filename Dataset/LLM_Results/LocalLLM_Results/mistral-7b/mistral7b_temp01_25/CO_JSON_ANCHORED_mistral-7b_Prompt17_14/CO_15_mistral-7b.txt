 Tag: Conversion

   Reason: The user initiated a task (clicking on "Customer Login") and completed it by entering their username and password, indicating a successful login. After logging in, the user did not abandon any other tasks, suggesting they navigated through the application as intended.

   1) [Step 1] The user visited the homepage ("/") from another page ("http://localhost:5173/restaurant/dashboard/settings").
   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "Customer Login" link, initiating a task.
   3) [Step 3] The user navigated to the login page and entered their username and password.
   4) [Step 4] The user successfully logged in, indicating a completed task.
   5) [Step 5] (Not shown in the log file) The user may have performed other tasks within the application, such as placing an order or viewing their account details, but since these are not shown in the provided logs, it is not possible to determine if they did so. However, since no abandoned tasks were observed, it can be inferred that the user continued to interact with the application as intended.

   The classification of this session as a conversion is based on the fact that all initiated tasks were completed by the user.
