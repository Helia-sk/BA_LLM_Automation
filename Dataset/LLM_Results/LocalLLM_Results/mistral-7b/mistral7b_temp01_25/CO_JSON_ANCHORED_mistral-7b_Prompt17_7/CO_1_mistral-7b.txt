 Tag: Conversion

   Reason: The user initiated the task of clicking on the "Customer Login" button, which was followed by a series of interactions with the username and password fields. These interactions indicate that the user intended to log in, and since all initiated tasks were completed (clicking the login button, entering a username, and entering a password), we can classify this session as a conversion.

   1) The user navigated to the homepage of the application ("http://localhost:5173/").
   2) The user clicked on the "Customer Login" button located at (604, 17).
   3) The user then interacted with the username field by clicking on it. This action triggered a debounced input event and a click event.
   4) The user entered a username ("User1") into the username field. This was followed by another debounced input event and a click event.
   5) The user clicked outside of the username field, triggering another click event.
   6) The user interacted with the password field by clicking on it. This action triggered a debounced input event and a click event.
   7) The user entered a password into the password field. This was followed by another debounced input event and a click event.
   8) The user clicked outside of the password field, triggering another click event.
   9) No further interactions were recorded, indicating that the user successfully logged in and completed their intended task.

   All the logs were considered to make this decision.
