==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user initiated a task (clicking on the "Menu" link) but did not complete it, instead scrolling and clicking elsewhere on the page. This indicates that the user did not find what they were looking for in the menu or lost interest, leading to a drop-off.

  1) [Step 1] The user accessed the restaurant dashboard page (/restaurant/dashboard/menu).
  2) [Step 2] The user scrolled down the page (scroll event).
  3) [Step 3] The user clicked on the "Menu" link (click event), but did not complete any further actions related to the menu.
  4) [Step 4] The user performed another click event, but no relevant information about the target of this click is provided in the logs.
  5) [Step 5] The user scrolled again on the page (scroll event).

I have considered all the logs provided to make my decision. The user initiated a task by clicking on the "Menu" link, but did not complete it, indicating a drop-off.
