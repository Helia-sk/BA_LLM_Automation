 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user initiated a task (clicked on "History") but did not complete it by clicking on "View Details". This indicates that the user abandoned the task.

   1) [Step 1] The user navigated to the restaurant dashboard page (/restaurant/dashboard).
   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "History" link located at x:676, y:126.
   3) [Step 3] The user arrived at the history page (/restaurant/dashboard/history), but did not click on any of the details to view them.
   4) [Step 4] The user clicked on the "Reject" button located at x:1538, y:298. This action is not considered as a completed task in this context.
   5) [Step 5] The user clicked on the back button or closed the page, ending the session.

The analysis was based on all the provided logs and the conditions mentioned in the question. The user initiated a task but did not complete it, hence the session is classified as a drop-off.
