==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user initiated a task (scrolling down the page) but did not complete it, indicating potential interest that was not fully engaged. However, since we have not observed any other tasks being completed, such as clicking on the "Reserve" button or interacting with the restaurant's details, we cannot definitively classify this session as a conversion.

   Here is the user journey step-by-step:
   1) [Step 1] The user visited the dashboard page (http://localhost:5173/customer/dashboard).
   2) [Step 2] The user scrolled down the page, indicating potential interest in the content.
   3) [Step 3] The user scrolled back to the top of the page, suggesting they might have wanted to revisit some information or navigate elsewhere.
   4) [Step 4] The user clicked on the "Restaurant" link (http://localhost:5173/customer/dashboard/restaurant/4), indicating interest in a specific restaurant.
   5) [Step 5] The user scrolled down the restaurant's page, possibly viewing its details and images.
   6) [Step 6] The user clicked on an image placeholder (No image available), suggesting they were interested in the restaurant's image but did not find one to their liking.
   7) [Step 7] The user scrolled back up the page, possibly reconsidering their interest or deciding to navigate elsewhere.
   8) [Step 8] The user clicked on the "Restaurants" link (http://localhost:5173/customer/dashboard), suggesting they might have wanted to view other restaurants.
   9) [Step 9] The user scrolled down the page, indicating potential interest in the list of restaurants.
   However, we do not see any further interaction that would indicate a completed task, such as clicking on a "Reserve" button or interacting with a restaurant's details, which is why we classify this session as a drop-off.
