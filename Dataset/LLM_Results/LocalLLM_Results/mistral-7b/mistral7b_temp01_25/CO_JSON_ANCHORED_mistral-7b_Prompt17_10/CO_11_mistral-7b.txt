==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user initiated a task (scrolling down the page) but did not complete it, indicating that they left the page without completing the intended action. This is evident from the logs showing multiple scroll events, but no further interaction after the initial visit to the "/customer/dashboard" page.

   User Journey:
   1) [Step 1] The user started a new session by visiting the "/customer/dashboard" page (log_1757774276450_fntdti8qo).
   2) [Step 2] The user scrolled down the page to a certain point (log_1757774275386_7sjdieux2, log_1757774274528_gt98ftf43).
   3) [Step 3] The user continued scrolling down the page (log_1757774274528_gt98ftf43), but no further interaction was recorded, suggesting that the user left the page without completing any tasks.
   Note: All logs were considered in this analysis. The user did not complete any initiated tasks, so the session was classified as a drop-off.
