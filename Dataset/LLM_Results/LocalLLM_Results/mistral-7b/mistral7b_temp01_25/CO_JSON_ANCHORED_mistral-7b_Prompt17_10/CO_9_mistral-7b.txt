 Tag: Conversion

   Reason: The user initiated a task (scrolling down the page) and completed it by scrolling to the bottom of the page. After that, the user clicked on an element ("No image available") which could be considered as exploring the content further. However, there is no subsequent log indicating any abandonment or drop-off. The user then scrolled back up the page, suggesting they were still engaged with the content. Finally, the user clicked on "Restaurant" in the navigation menu, indicating a clear intent to continue interacting with the application.

   1) [Step 1] User landed on the homepage ("/customer/dashboard").
   2) [Step 2] User scrolled down the page (indicating engagement).
   3) [Step 3] User clicked on an image placeholder ("No image available").
   4) [Step 4] User scrolled back up the page.
   5) [Step 5] User clicked on "Restaurant" in the navigation menu, indicating a desire to explore more restaurants.
