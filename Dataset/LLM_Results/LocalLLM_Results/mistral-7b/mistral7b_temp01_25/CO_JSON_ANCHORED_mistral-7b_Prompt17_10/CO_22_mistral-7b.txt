==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user initiated tasks (clicking on the "Restaurant Partners" link and filling in the username field), but did not complete the task of entering a password or clicking the login button, indicating that they abandoned the process before completing the login.

  1) [Step 1] User clicked on the "Restaurant Partners" link to navigate to the restaurant login page.
  2) [Step 2] User filled in their username ("User1") in the username field.
  3) [Step 3] User did not enter a password or click the login button, indicating that they abandoned the process before completing the login.

   The logs do not show any further interaction from the user after this point, so it is assumed that the session was dropped off at this stage. It's important to note that all initiated tasks were not completed, which is a key factor in classifying this as a drop-off.
