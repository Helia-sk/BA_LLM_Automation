==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user initiated a task (clicking on the "Customer Login" link) but did not complete it by entering their username and password. Instead, they left the page after clicking on the login form and the input field for the username.

   1) [Step 1] User navigated to the homepage of the website.
   2) [Step 2] User clicked on the "Customer Login" link located at the top right corner of the page.
   3) [Step 3] User's cursor moved over the login form and clicked on the input field for the username, but did not enter any text.
   4) [Step 4] The user left the page by clicking outside the login form.

The logs provided do not show any further interaction from the user, so it is assumed that they have dropped off at this point. It's important to note that all initiated tasks were not completed, as the user did not enter their username and password to log in.
