 Tag: Conversion

   Reason: The user initiated two tasks (clicking on the "Restaurant Login" link and then clicking on the username input field), and completed both of them by entering a username. No other tasks were initiated, so there was no abandonment.

   1) [Step 1] The user clicked on the "Restaurant Login" link to initiate the login process.
   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the username input field to start entering their username.
   3) [Step 3] The user entered a username ("User1") in the username input field, indicating completion of this task.
   No further tasks were initiated, so the session was completed.

   All logs have been considered in making this decision.
