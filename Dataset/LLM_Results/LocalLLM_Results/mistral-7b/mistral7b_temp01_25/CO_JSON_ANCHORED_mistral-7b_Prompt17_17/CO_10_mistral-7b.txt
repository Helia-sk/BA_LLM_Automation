==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user initiated tasks by clicking on "Balance" and then "Orders", but did not complete any of those tasks. Instead, they clicked on "Orders" again, which suggests that they might have been confused or lost interest in the previous tasks they had initiated.

   User Journey:
   1) [Step 1] The user started the session by clicking on the "Balance" link.
   2) [Step 2] The user then clicked on the "Orders" link instead of proceeding with the balance task.
   3) [Step 3] The user clicked on the "Orders" link again, which indicates that they might have been confused or lost interest in the previous tasks they had initiated. However, they did not complete any tasks related to orders as well.
   4) [Step 4] The user clicked on the "View Details" button for an order, but this action does not seem to be a completed task as there is no subsequent log indicating completion of that task or any other task.
   5) [Step 5] The user clicked on the "Orders" link again, which suggests that they might have been trying to navigate back to the orders page, possibly in an attempt to find what they were looking for earlier.
   6) [Step 6] The user clicked on the "Cart" link, but this action does not seem to be a completed task as there is no subsequent log indicating completion of that task or any other task.
   7) [Step 7] The user clicked on the "Balance" link again, which suggests that they might have been trying to revisit the balance page, possibly in an attempt to find what they were looking for earlier. However, they did not complete any tasks related to the balance as well.
   It is important to note that all initiated tasks were abandoned, and no completed tasks were found in the log file. Therefore, the session was a drop-off.
