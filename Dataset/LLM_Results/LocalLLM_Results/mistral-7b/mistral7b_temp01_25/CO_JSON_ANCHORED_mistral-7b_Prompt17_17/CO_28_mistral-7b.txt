==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user initiated a form submission (login), but did not complete it, as indicated by the "form_submit" event. However, the user also performed other actions such as clicking on buttons and changing input values, suggesting that they were actively interacting with the site. Since one of the initiated tasks was abandoned (the login form), the session is classified as a drop-off.

   User Journey:
   1) [Step 1] The user visited the restaurant's website (URL not specified in logs).
   2) [Step 2] The user navigated to the login page (/restaurant/login).
   3) [Step 3] The user entered their credentials into the login form.
   4) [Step 4] The user clicked the "Sign In" button, initiating a form submission.
   5) [Step 5] The user changed the password input value (indicating they were still interacting with the site), but did not complete the form submission.
   6) [Step 6] The user clicked on other buttons and performed additional interactions on the site, but ultimately left the site without completing the login process.
