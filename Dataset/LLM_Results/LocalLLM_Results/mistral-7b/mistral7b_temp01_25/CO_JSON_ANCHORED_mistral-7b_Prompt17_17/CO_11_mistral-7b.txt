 Tag: Drop-Off

   Reason: The user initiated a task (scrolling down the page) but did not complete it, as indicated by the subsequent scroll events. However, since no other tasks were initiated after this, we cannot definitively say if all tasks were completed or abandoned. But based on the provided logs, the user did not complete all tasks, so the session is classified as a drop-off.

   1) [Step 1] The user accessed the customer dashboard page (/customer/dashboard).
   2) [Step 2] The user scrolled down the page to a height of approximately 310 pixels from the top.
   3) [Step 3] The user continued scrolling down the page, reaching a height of approximately 1348 pixels from the top.
   4) [Step 4] The user further scrolled down the page, reaching a height of approximately 2044 pixels from the top.
   5) [Step 5] The user did not initiate any other tasks after this, indicating that they may have left the page or abandoned it without completing any other actions.
