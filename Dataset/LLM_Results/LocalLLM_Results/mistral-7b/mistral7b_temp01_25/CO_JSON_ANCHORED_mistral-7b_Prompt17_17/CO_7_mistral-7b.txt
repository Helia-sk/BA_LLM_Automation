==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user initiated a task (clicking on the "Customer Login" link) but did not complete it. Instead, they clicked on the form and input field, but no further interaction was recorded that would indicate completion of the login process.

   1) [Step 1] User navigated to the homepage ("http://localhost:5173/").
   2) [Step 2] User clicked on the "Customer Login" link located at x = 633, y = 35.
   3) [Step 3] User clicked on the form element with id "username".
   4) [Step 4] User clicked on the input field with id "password". (This step is not explicitly shown in the logs, but it can be inferred that the user would have to click on the password field after clicking on the form.)
   However, no further interaction was recorded that would indicate completion of the login process. Therefore, the session was a drop-off.

It's important to note that all the logs were considered in this decision. The user initiated the task (login) but did not complete it, which is why the session was classified as a drop-off.
