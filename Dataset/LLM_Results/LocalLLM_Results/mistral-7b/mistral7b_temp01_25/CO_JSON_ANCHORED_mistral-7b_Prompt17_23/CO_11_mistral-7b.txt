==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user initiated a task (scrolling down the page) but did not complete it, indicating that they left the page without completing the intended action. This is evident from the logs as the scroll events stopped after a certain point and no further interactions were recorded.

   1) [Step 1] The user accessed the customer dashboard page (/customer/dashboard) at "2025-09-13T14:37:56.450Z".
   2) [Step 2] The user scrolled down the page to a certain point, as indicated by the scroll events at "2025-09-13T14:37:55.386Z", "2025-09-13T14:37:54.528Z", and "2025-09-13T14:37:54.450Z".
   3) [Step 3] The user did not interact with any other elements on the page, indicating that they left the page without completing any tasks or initiating further actions. This is supported by the lack of subsequent logs showing interactions after the scroll events.
   I have considered all the logs provided in the log file to make this decision.
