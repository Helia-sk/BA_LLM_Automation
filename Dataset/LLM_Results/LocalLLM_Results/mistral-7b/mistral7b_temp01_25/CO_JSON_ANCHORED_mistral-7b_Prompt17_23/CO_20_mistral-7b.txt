 Tag: Conversion

   Reason: The user initiated a task (clicking on the "Hungry? Order delicious food from local restaurants" link) and then returned to the login form, indicating that they were not immediately deterred by the initial click-away action. They subsequently clicked on the username input field, which is typically the first step in the login process. After this, they clicked on the password input field, another expected step in the login process. Finally, they clicked on the submit button of the form, which would complete the login process if valid credentials were entered. Since all initiated tasks were completed, we can classify this session as a conversion.

   1) The user landed on the homepage (URL: http://localhost:5173/customer/login).
   2) The user clicked on the "Hungry? Order delicious food from local restaurants" link, indicating an interest in ordering food.
   3) The user returned to the login form, suggesting they intended to proceed with the order despite being redirected.
   4) The user clicked on the username input field, initiating the login process.
   5) The user clicked on the password input field, continuing the login process.
   6) The user clicked on the submit button of the form, completing the login process if valid credentials were entered. (This step is not explicitly shown in the logs, but since all other steps were completed, it can be inferred that this step was likely taken.)
