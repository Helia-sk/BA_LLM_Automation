 Tag: Conversion

   Reason: All initiated tasks in this session were completed. The user first scrolled down the page (Log 1), then clicked on an image (Log 5) which could be considered as initiating a task, but since there are no subsequent logs indicating abandonment of that task, it can be assumed that the user continued with the next step. The user then scrolled down again (Log 6), which could be another initiated task, but again, there are no subsequent logs indicating abandonment, so it can be assumed that the user continued with the next step. Finally, the user clicked on the "Restaurant" link (Log 7) which is a clear indication of completing the intended action, and there are no subsequent logs indicating abandonment, so it can be concluded that the user completed all initiated tasks.

   1) The user landed on the dashboard page (Log 1).
   2) The user scrolled down the page (Log 1).
   3) The user clicked on an image (Log 5), initiating a task.
   4) The user scrolled down again (Log 6), initiating another task.
   5) The user clicked on the "Restaurant" link (Log 7), completing the intended action and thus, completing all initiated tasks.
   I have considered all the logs in my decision making process.
