   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "Restaurant Partners" link, which is a call-to-action for either registering a new restaurant or logging in to manage orders.
   3) [Step 3] The user then clicked on the username input field in the login form, indicating they are preparing to enter their username.
   4) [Step 4] The user entered their username into the login form and completed the task of logging in.
