==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user initiated a task (clicking on "History") but did not complete it by clicking on "View Details". This indicates that the user abandoned the task.

   1) [Step 1] The user navigated to the restaurant dashboard page (/restaurant/dashboard).
   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "History" link, indicating an initiated task.
   3) [Step 3] The user did not click on any of the history items to view details, suggesting that they abandoned the task.
   4) [Step 4] The user clicked on the "Reject" button in the order management system, which could indicate a decision to cancel an order or reject a request. However, this is not directly related to the initiated task of viewing history details.
   5) [Step 5] The user left the page by clicking on the X button in the top right corner, ending the session.

All the logs were considered in the decision making process. The user initiated a task but did not complete it, which is indicative of a drop-off.
