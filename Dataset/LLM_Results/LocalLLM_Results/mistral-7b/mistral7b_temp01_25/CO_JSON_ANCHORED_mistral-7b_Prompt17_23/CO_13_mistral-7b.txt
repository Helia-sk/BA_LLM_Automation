==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user initiated a task (clicking on "History") but did not complete it by clicking on any of the subsequent options ("View Details", "X"). This indicates that the user abandoned the task before completing it.

   1) [Step 1] The user accessed the restaurant dashboard page.
   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "History" option in the navigation menu.
   3) [Step 3] The user did not click on any of the options within the history section, indicating that they did not view or interact with the details of any orders.
   4) [Step 4] The user clicked on the "X" button, which could suggest that they were trying to close a pop-up or dialog box, but since no such element is specified in the logs, it's unclear what exactly was closed.
   5) [Step 5] The user did not perform any other actions in the log file, indicating that they left the page without completing any tasks.
   Note: It's important to consider all the logs provided to make an informed decision. In this case, since the user initiated a task but did not complete it, the session can be classified as a drop-off.
