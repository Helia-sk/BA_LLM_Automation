==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user initiated a task (clicked on "History") but did not complete it by clicking on "View Details". This indicates that the user abandoned the task.

   1) [Step 1] The user navigated to the restaurant dashboard page (/restaurant/dashboard).
   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "History" link located at x = 676, y = 126.
   3) [Step 3] The user did not click on any of the history items to view details, instead they clicked on the "Reject" button located at x = 1538, y = 298.
   4) [Step 4] The user clicked on the "Reject" button again to confirm their decision.
   5) [Step 5] The user navigated away from the page by clicking on the "Back" button or closing the tab/window.

All initiated tasks were not completed, so the session was a drop-off. It is important to note that all logs were considered in this analysis.
