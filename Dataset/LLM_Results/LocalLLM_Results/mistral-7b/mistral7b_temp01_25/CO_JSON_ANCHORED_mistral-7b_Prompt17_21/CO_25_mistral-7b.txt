==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user initiated a task (clicking on the "Menu" link) but did not complete any other tasks related to the menu page. Specifically, there is no evidence of any interaction with the menu items or any other elements on the menu page that would indicate further engagement with the menu.

   User Journey:
   1) [Step 1] The user accessed the restaurant dashboard page (URL: http://localhost:5173/restaurant/dashboard/menu).
   2) [Step 2] The user scrolled down the page to a certain point (event: scroll).
   3) [Step 3] The user clicked on the "Menu" link (event: click), but did not interact with any other elements on the menu page.
   Since the user did not complete any other tasks related to the menu, this session can be classified as a drop-off.
