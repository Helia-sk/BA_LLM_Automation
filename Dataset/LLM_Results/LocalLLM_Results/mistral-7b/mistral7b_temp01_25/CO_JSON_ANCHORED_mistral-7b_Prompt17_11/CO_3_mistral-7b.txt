 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user initiated the task of logging in to the restaurant, but did not complete it by entering a username or password. Instead, they clicked on the username input field and then left the page without performing any further actions related to the login process.

   1) [Step 1] The user navigated to the Restaurant Login page (indicated by the "click" event on the "Restaurant Login" link).
   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the username input field (indicated by the "click" event on the username input field).
   3) [Step 3] The user did not enter any text into the username input field, indicating that they did not intend to log in with a valid username.
   4) [Step 4] The user did not click on or interact with the password input field or the login button, suggesting that they abandoned the login process.
   5) [Step 5] The user did not perform any further actions related to the restaurant, indicating that they left the page without completing any other tasks.
   Note: All initiated tasks (navigating to the login page and clicking on the username input field) were not completed, so the session was classified as a drop-off.
