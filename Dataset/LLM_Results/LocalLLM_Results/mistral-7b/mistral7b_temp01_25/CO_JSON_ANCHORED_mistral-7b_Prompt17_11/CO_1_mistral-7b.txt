 Tag: Conversion

   Reason: The user initiated the task of clicking on the "Customer Login" button, and subsequently completed the tasks of entering their username ("User1") twice (once by clicking on the username input field and once by typing in the username), and then clicking the submit button for the password input field. This indicates that the user successfully logged in, which is a conversion event.

   1) The user navigated to the customer login page.
   2) The user clicked on the "Customer Login" button.
   3) The user clicked on the username input field.
   4) The user typed in the username "User1".
   5) The user clicked outside of the username input field, presumably to move focus to the password input field.
   6) The user clicked on the password input field.
   7) The user did not type anything into the password input field, but this is not necessary for a successful login as the system may have autofilled or remembered the password.
   8) The user clicked the submit button for the password input field, which successfully logged them in.
