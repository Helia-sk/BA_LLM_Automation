==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user initiated a task (clicking on the "Customer Login" link) but did not complete it by entering their username and password. This indicates that they abandoned the session before completing the login process, which is considered a drop-off in this context.

   User Journey:
   1) [Step 1] The user navigated to the homepage of the website (indicated by the first log with no specific element clicked).
   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "Customer Login" link, which initiated the login process (log with text "Customer Login").
   3) [Step 3] The user clicked on the username input field but did not enter any information (log with text "Username Input Field Clicked").
   4) [Step 4] The user did not click on or interact with the password input field, suggesting they did not intend to enter their password (no log indicating password interaction).
   5) [Step 5] The user did not submit the login form by clicking the submit button (no log indicating form submission).
   Therefore, the user initiated a task but did not complete it, classifying this session as a drop-off.
