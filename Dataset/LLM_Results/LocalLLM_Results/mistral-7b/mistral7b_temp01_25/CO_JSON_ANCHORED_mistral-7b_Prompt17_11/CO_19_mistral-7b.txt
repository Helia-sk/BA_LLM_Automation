==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user initiated a task (clicking on "Customer Login") but did not complete it, instead navigating away from the page. This indicates that the session was not completed as intended.

   1) [Step 1] The user was on the restaurant dashboard settings page ("/restaurant/dashboard/settings").
   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "Customer Login" link, indicating an intent to start a new task (login as a customer).
   3) [Step 3] The user navigated away from the customer login page, suggesting that they did not complete the intended task.
   It is important to note that the user did not initiate any other tasks in this session, so no other steps were taken. The user journey ended with a drop-off.
