 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user initiated tasks by clicking on "Orders" and "Balance", but did not complete any of those tasks. Instead, they clicked on "View Details" for an order, but then closed the session without interacting further with that order or any other part of the site. This indicates that the user did not complete their intended actions, suggesting a drop-off.
