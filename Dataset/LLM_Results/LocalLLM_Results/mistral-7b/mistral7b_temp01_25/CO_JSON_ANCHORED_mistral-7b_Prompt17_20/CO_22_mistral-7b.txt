 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user initiated tasks (clicking on the "Restaurant Partners" link and filling in the username field), but did not complete the task of entering a password or clicking the login button, which suggests that they abandoned the session before completing the login process.

  1) [Step 1] User navigated to the Restaurant Partners page by clicking on the corresponding link.
  2) [Step 2] User clicked on the "Login" button to initiate the login process.
  3) [Step 3] User entered a username ("User1") in the username field.
  4) [Step 4] User did not enter a password or click the login button, indicating that they abandoned the session before completing the login process.

   The user journey ended as a drop-off because the user initiated the login process but did not complete it by entering a password and clicking the login button. All logs were considered in this analysis.
