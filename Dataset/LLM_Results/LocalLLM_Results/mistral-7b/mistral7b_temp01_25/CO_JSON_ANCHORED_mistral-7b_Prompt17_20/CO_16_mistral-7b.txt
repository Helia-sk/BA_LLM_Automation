==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user initiated the task of clicking on the "Customer Login" link, but did not complete the subsequent tasks such as entering a username and password. This indicates that the user abandoned the process before completing it.

   User Journey:
   1) [Step 1] The user navigated to the homepage (not shown in logs).
   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "Customer Login" link, indicating an intent to log in.
   3) [Step 3] The user did not perform any actions related to entering a username or password, suggesting that they abandoned the login process.
   Note: Although the user clicked on the "Customer Login" field for the username and password fields, these clicks were not followed by any text input, which indicates that the user did not intend to enter any information.

   The logs do not show any subsequent actions after the user abandoned the login process, so it is not possible to determine if the user navigated away from the site or performed any other actions. However, based on the provided logs, the session can be classified as a drop-off because the initiated task of logging in was not completed.
