==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user initiated a task (clicking on the "Menu" link) but did not complete any other tasks related to the menu page. Specifically, there is no evidence of any interaction with the menu items, scrolling through the menu, or clicking on any other links within the menu section.

   User Journey:
   1) [Step 1] The user accessed the restaurant's dashboard page (URL: http://localhost:5173/restaurant/dashboard/menu).
   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "Menu" link located at x=571, y=125.
   3) [Step 3] The user scrolled down the page to position y=81 but did not interact with any other elements on the menu page.
   4) [Step 4] The user then scrolled back up and exited the page without performing any further actions related to the menu.
   Note: Although there were additional frontend logs, they do not pertain to the menu section of the website, so they are not included in this user journey.
