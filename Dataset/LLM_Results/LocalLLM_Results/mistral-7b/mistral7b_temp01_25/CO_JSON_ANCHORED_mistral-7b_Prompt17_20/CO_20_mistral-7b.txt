 Tag: Conversion

   Reason: The user initiated the task of logging in by clicking on the "UsernamePasswordSign In" button, and then proceeded to click on both the username and password input fields, indicating that they are entering their login credentials. After entering their credentials, they clicked the submit button, which is typically associated with a successful login attempt. Since all initiated tasks were completed, this session can be classified as a conversion.

   1) The user landed on the homepage (URL: http://localhost:5173/customer/login).
   2) The user clicked on the "UsernamePasswordSign In" button to initiate the login process.
   3) The user clicked on the username input field and entered their username.
   4) The user clicked on the password input field and entered their password.
   5) The user clicked the submit button, indicating a successful login attempt.
   6) The user clicked on the link "Hungry?Order delicious food from local restaurants", which suggests they are navigating to the food ordering section of the site. This step is not directly related to the login process but indicates that the user is actively engaging with the site after a successful login, further supporting the classification as a conversion.

   All logs were considered in this analysis. The user initiated the login task and successfully completed it, indicating a conversion.
