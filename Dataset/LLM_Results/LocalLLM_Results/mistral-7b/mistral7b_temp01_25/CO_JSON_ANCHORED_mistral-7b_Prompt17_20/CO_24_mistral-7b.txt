 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: One of the initiated tasks (uploading an image for a menu item) was abandoned, as there is no subsequent log indicating that the task was completed.

   1) [Step 1] The user navigated to the restaurant dashboard page (http://localhost:5173/restaurant/dashboard/menu).
   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "Menu" link in the navigation bar.
   3) [Step 3] The user clicked on the "ImageDrag image here or click to upload" area within the form for adding a new menu item.
   4) [Step 4] The user clicked on an SVG element, but it is not clear what action this might have triggered as there is no subsequent log indicating the result of that action.
   5) [Step 5] The user did not complete any other initiated tasks (such as saving changes or cancelling the operation), and the session ended.
   It should be noted that all logs were considered in this analysis.
