==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user initiated a task (scrolling down the page) but did not complete it, indicating that they left the page without completing the intended action. This is evident from the logs where the scroll event was initiated multiple times but the user never scrolled to the bottom of the page or clicked on any other interactive elements.

  1) [Step 1] The user accessed the customer dashboard page (/customer/dashboard).
  2) [Step 2] The user scrolled down the page multiple times, indicating they were exploring the content. However, they did not scroll to the bottom of the page or click on any other interactive elements.
  3) [Step 3] The user continued to scroll down the page but again did not complete the intended action, suggesting that they left the page without interacting further.
  4) [Step 4] No subsequent interactions were recorded, indicating that the session was abandoned.

   It is important to note that all logs in this file pertain to a single user and a single session, which started from the customer dashboard page. The user did not initiate any other tasks or interact with any other elements on the page, suggesting that they left the page without completing their intended action. Therefore, based on the provided logs, this session can be classified as a drop-off.
