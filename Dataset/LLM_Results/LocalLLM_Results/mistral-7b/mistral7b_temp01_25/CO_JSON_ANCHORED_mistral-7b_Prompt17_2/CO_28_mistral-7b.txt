==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user initiated a login process (form_submit event), but did not complete any further tasks such as clicking the "Sign In" button or entering any data in the password field. This indicates that the session was abandoned before completion of all initiated tasks.

   User Journey:
   1) [Step 1] The user navigated to the restaurant's login page (route: /restaurant/login).
   2) [Step 2] The user did not enter any data in the username field, suggesting they may have already been logged in or chose not to log in.
   3) [Step 3] The user clicked on the "Sign In" button (click event), which initiated a login process.
   4) [Step 4] The user did not enter any data in the password field, suggesting they may have decided against logging in or encountered an issue with the form.
   5) [Step 5] The user's session ended without any further interaction (blur event on the password field), indicating that the login process was abandoned.
