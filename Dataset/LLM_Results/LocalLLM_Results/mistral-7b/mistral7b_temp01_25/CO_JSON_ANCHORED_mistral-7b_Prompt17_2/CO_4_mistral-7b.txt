 Tag: Conversion

   Reason: The user initiated a task (clicking on the "Restaurant Login" link) and completed it by entering their username and password, indicating a successful login. After logging in, they clicked on the button "Already have an account? Sign in", which is not a required step for the conversion but indicates further interaction with the site, suggesting engagement beyond the initial task.

   1) The user arrived at the Restaurant Login page (indicated by clicking on the "Restaurant Login" link).
   2) The user initiated the login process by clicking on the username input field.
   3) The user entered their username and password, indicating they were providing their credentials for login.
   4) The user successfully logged in, as indicated by no error messages or drop-off events after the login attempt.
   5) The user clicked on the "Already have an account? Sign in" button, which is not a required step for the conversion but indicates further interaction with the site.

   All initiated tasks were completed, so the session was a conversion. The user journey started with the user clicking on the "Restaurant Login" link, followed by entering their credentials and successfully logging in, and ended with an optional click on the "Already have an account? Sign in" button. All logs were considered to make this determination.
