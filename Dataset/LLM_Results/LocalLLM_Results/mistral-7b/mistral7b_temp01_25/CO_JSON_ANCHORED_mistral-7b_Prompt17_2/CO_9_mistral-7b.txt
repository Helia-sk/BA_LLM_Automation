 Tag: Conversion

   Reason: The user initiated a task (scrolling down the page) and completed it by scrolling to the bottom of the page. After that, the user clicked on an element (the "No image available" div), which could be considered as interacting with content, indicating engagement. Later, the user scrolled up the page again, suggesting they were navigating through the content. Finally, the user clicked on another element ("Restaurant 4"), indicating a clear intention to engage further. Since all initiated tasks were completed, this session can be classified as a conversion.

   1) The user landed on the dashboard page (/customer/dashboard).
   2) The user scrolled down the page, indicating they were exploring the content.
   3) The user encountered an image for Restaurant 4 but found it unavailable, so they clicked on the "No image available" div instead.
   4) After clicking on the "No image available" div, the user scrolled up the page to view more content.
   5) The user then decided to click on Restaurant 4, indicating a clear intention to engage further with that restaurant's details.

   I have considered all the logs in my decision making and classification of this session as a conversion.
