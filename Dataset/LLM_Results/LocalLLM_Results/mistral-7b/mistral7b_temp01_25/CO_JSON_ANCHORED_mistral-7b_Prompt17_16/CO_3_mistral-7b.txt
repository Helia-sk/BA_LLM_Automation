 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user initiated the task of logging into the restaurant, but did not complete it by entering a username or password. Instead, they clicked on the login input field and then left the page without performing any further actions related to the login process.

   1) [Step 1] The user navigated to the Restaurant Login page (as indicated by the "Restaurant Login" link click event).
   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the username input field, but did not enter any text or perform any other actions related to entering a username.
   3) [Step 3] The user clicked on the password input field, but did not enter any text or perform any other actions related to entering a password.
   4) [Step 4] The user did not click on the login button or perform any other actions that would indicate an attempt to submit the login form.
   5) [Step 5] The user left the page without performing any further interactions, as indicated by the absence of subsequent log events.

   It is important to note that while the user did click on the login link and navigate to the login page, they did not complete the intended task of logging in. Therefore, based on the provided logs, this session can be classified as a drop-off.
