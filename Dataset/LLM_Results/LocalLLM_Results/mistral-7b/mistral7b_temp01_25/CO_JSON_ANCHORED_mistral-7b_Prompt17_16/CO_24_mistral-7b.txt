 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user initiated a task (clicking on the "Menu" link) but did not complete it, as indicated by the subsequent clicks on various elements within the menu page without any further interaction that would suggest completing a task.

   1) [Step 1] The user accessed the restaurant dashboard page.
   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "Menu" link to navigate to the menu page.
   3) [Step 3] The user interacted with various elements within the menu page, such as clicking on an SVG element and a form, but did not complete any tasks or return to the dashboard page.
   [Note: The user's interaction with the image drag and upload area in the form does not necessarily indicate a completed task, as it is unclear whether the user intended to upload an image or simply clicked on that area.]
   [Note: The user did not interact with any elements suggesting saving changes or placing an order, which would indicate completion of tasks.]
   [Note: The user's session ended without further interaction, indicating a drop-off.]
