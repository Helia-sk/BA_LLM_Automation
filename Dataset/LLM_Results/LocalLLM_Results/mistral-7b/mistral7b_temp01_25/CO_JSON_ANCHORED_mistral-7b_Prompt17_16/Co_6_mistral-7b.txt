 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user initiated a task (clicking on the "Customer Login" link) but did not complete it by entering their username and password. Instead, they left the page without any further interaction.

   User Journey:
   1) [Step 1] The user navigated to the homepage of the website.
   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "Customer Login" link located at the top right corner of the page.
   3) [Step 3] The user's cursor moved over the username input field, but they did not click or interact with it.
   4) [Step 4] The user's cursor moved over the password input field, but they did not click or interact with it either.
   5) [Step 5] The user did not submit the login form by clicking on the login button.
   6) [Step 6] The user left the page without any further interaction.

   All initiated tasks were not completed, so the session was classified as a drop-off. It is important to note that this analysis is based on the provided logs and does not consider other factors such as user intent or potential technical issues. A more comprehensive analysis would require additional data and context.
