==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user initiated a task (scrolling down the page) but did not complete it, indicating that they left the page without completing the intended action. This is evident from the logs where the scroll event was initiated multiple times but the user never scrolled to the bottom of the page or clicked on any other interactive elements.

  1) [Step 1] The user accessed the customer dashboard page (/customer/dashboard).
  2) [Step 2] The user scrolled down the page multiple times, indicating an attempt to navigate through the content.
  3) [Step 3] The user did not interact with any other elements on the page, such as clicking on a link or button, and eventually left the page without completing any tasks.

   It is important to note that all logs were related to the same session (session_1757771443548_7eqjj0e9b), and no other interactive events were recorded, suggesting that the user did not complete any initiated tasks. Therefore, the session was a drop-off.
