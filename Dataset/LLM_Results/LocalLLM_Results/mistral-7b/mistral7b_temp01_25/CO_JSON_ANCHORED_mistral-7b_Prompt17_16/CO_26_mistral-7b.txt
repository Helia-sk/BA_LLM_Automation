 Tag: Conversion

   Reason: The user initiated a task (clicking on "Add Item") and completed it by clicking on the specific item ("Saladmixvery healthy€0.08"). This indicates that the user has successfully added an item to their cart, which is one of the tasks required for a conversion in this context.

   1) The user landed on the menu page (http://localhost:5173/restaurant/dashboard/menu).
   2) The user scrolled down the menu items and hovered over different options without clicking ("Drag image here or click to uploadcccc€0.04", "best dessert everSuper sweet€1.00", "MojitoSuper Minti€1.00").
   3) The user clicked on the "Add Item" button, indicating they wanted to add an item to their cart.
   4) The user selected a specific item ("Saladmixvery healthy€0.08") from the list of menu items and clicked on it to add it to their cart.
   5) The user did not perform any other actions that would indicate abandoning the session, such as closing the browser or navigating away from the site.

   I have considered all the logs in my decision making process. The user initiated a task (adding an item to their cart), completed it, and did not abandon the session, which meets the criteria for a conversion.
