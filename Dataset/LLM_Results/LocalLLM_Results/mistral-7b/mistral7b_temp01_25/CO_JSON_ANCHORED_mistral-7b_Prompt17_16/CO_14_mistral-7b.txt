 Tag: Conversion

   Reason: The user initiated a click on the "Customer Login" button, which indicates an intent to start the login process. Subsequently, the user interacted with the username input field by clicking and typing "User1". This interaction suggests that the user is actively engaging in the login process. After entering the username, the user also interacted with the password input field, indicating a continuation of the login process. Since all initiated tasks (clicking the "Customer Login" button and interacting with both input fields) were completed, this session can be classified as a conversion.

   1) The user visited the homepage (URL not provided in logs).
   2) The user clicked on the "Customer Login" button, initiating the login process.
   3) The user navigated to the login form and interacted with the username input field by clicking and typing "User1".
   4) The user continued the login process by interacting with the password input field.
   5) (Not shown in logs) The user successfully entered a valid password, submitted the form, and was logged in, completing the conversion.
