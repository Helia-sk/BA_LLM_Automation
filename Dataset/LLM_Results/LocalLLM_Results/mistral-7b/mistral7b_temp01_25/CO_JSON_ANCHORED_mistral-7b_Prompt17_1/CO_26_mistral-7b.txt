 Tag: Conversion

   Reason: The user initiated a task (clicking on "Add Item") and completed it by clicking on the specific item ("Saladmixvery healthy€0.08"). There are no logs indicating that any other tasks were abandoned, so we can conclude that the session was a conversion.

   2) [Step 2] The user scrolled down the page to view the menu items and prices.
   3) [Step 3] The user clicked on the "Add Item" button.
   4) [Step 4] The user selected a specific item ("Saladmixvery healthy€0.08") from the list of menu items.
   5) [Step 5] The user did not perform any other actions that would indicate abandoning the session, such as clicking the back button or closing the browser window.

   All the logs were considered in the decision making process.
