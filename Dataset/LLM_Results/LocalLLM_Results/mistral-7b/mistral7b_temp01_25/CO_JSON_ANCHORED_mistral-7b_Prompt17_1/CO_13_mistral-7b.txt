 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user initiated a task (clicking on "History") but did not complete it by clicking on "View Details". Instead, they clicked on the "X" button which is typically used to close or cancel an action. This suggests that the user may have decided to leave the page without completing the intended action.

  1) [Step 1] The user accessed the restaurant dashboard page (route: /restaurant/dashboard/history).
  2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "History" link, indicating an interest in viewing the history of orders or events.
  3) [Step 3] Instead of clicking on "View Details" to explore further, the user clicked on the "X" button, which is usually associated with closing or canceling actions, suggesting they may have decided to leave the page without completing the intended action.

   All initiated tasks were not completed, so the session was a drop-off. It's important to note that this analysis is based on the information provided in the logs and does not account for any potential user intent or context outside of the logged actions.
