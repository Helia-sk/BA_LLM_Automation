 Tag: Conversion

   Reason: The user initiated a task (scrolling down the page) and completed it by scrolling to the bottom of the page, indicating that they were actively engaged with the content. Later, the user clicked on an element ("No image available") which could be considered as another initiated task. Although we don't have information about the purpose or outcome of this click, the fact that the user continued their interaction (scrolling again) suggests that they might have completed this task as well. Since all initiated tasks were completed, the session can be classified as a conversion.

   1) [Step 1] The user landed on the homepage ("/customer/dashboard").
   2) [Step 2] The user scrolled down the page (scroll event).
   3) [Step 3] The user scrolled to the bottom of the page (scroll event).
   4) [Step 4] The user clicked on an image placeholder ("No image available").
   5) [Step 5] The user continued scrolling down the page (scroll event), suggesting they might have completed the initiated task from step 4.
   6) [Step 6] The session ended without any further interaction, but since all initiated tasks were completed, it can be classified as a conversion.
