==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: One of the initiated tasks (uploading an image for a menu item) was abandoned, as there is no subsequent log indicating that it was completed.

   1) [Step 1] The user navigated to the restaurant dashboard page (http://localhost:5173/restaurant/dashboard/menu).
   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "Menu" link in the navigation bar, indicating they wanted to manage the menu items.
   3) [Step 3] The user clicked on the "ImageDrag image here or click to upload" area within the form for adding a new menu item. This indicates that they intended to add a new item.
   4) [Step 4] The user did not complete the task of uploading an image, as there is no subsequent log indicating that it was done. Instead, they clicked elsewhere on the page (an SVG element at x=664, y=338), which could suggest navigation or interaction with other UI elements but does not necessarily indicate completion of the intended task.
   5) [Step 5] The user did not perform any further actions related to adding a new menu item, such as filling out the form fields for name, description, price, category, etc., or clicking the "Save Changes" button. This suggests that they abandoned the task of adding a new menu item.
   6) [Step 6] The user did not perform any other actions in the log file that could be considered as completing another initiated task, such as editing an existing menu item or navigating to a different page.
   Note: It is possible that the user performed additional actions outside of the scope of this log file, but based on the provided logs, it appears that they abandoned the task of adding a new menu item and did not complete any other initiated tasks.
