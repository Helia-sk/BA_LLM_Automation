 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user initiated tasks by clicking on "Balance" and then "Orders", but did not complete any of those tasks. Instead, they clicked on "Orders" again, which suggests that they might have been confused or had an issue with the previous page they landed on. After that, they clicked on "View Details" under Orders, but did not proceed further, indicating that they may have abandoned the task. Lastly, they clicked on "Orders" again, suggesting a possible attempt to revisit the page, but no further actions were taken.
