==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user initiated a task (clicking on the "Customer Login" link) but did not complete it by entering their username and password. This indicates that they abandoned the session before completing the login process.

  1) [Step 1] The user navigated to the homepage of the website ("http://localhost:5173/").
  2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "Customer Login" link located at x=633, y=35.
  3) [Step 3] The user clicked on the username input field (x=451, y=310).
  4) [Step 4] The user did not enter any text into the username input field.
  5) [Step 5] The user did not click on the password input field or submit button, indicating that they abandoned the session.

   All initiated tasks were not completed, so the session was a drop-off. It is important to note that all logs were considered in this decision.
