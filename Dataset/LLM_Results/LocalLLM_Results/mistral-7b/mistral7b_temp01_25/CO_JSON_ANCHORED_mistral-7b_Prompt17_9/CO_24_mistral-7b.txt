 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user initiated a task (clicking on the "Menu" link) but did not complete it. Instead, they clicked on various other elements on the page without interacting with the form to upload an image or add a new menu item.

   1) [Step 1] The user accessed the restaurant dashboard at http://localhost:5173/restaurant/dashboard/menu.
   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "Menu" link located at x = 586, y = 124.
   3) [Step 3] The user hovered over an SVG element located at x = 664, y = 338 but did not click on it.
   4) [Step 4] The user clicked on the "ImageDrag image here or click to upload" text located within a form.
   5) [Step 5] The user clicked on various elements within the form (CategoryStartersMain CoursesDessertsDrinksSide Dishes, Name, Description, ccPrice (€), Available for order, Cancel, Save Changes) but did not interact with any of the input fields or submit the form.
   6) [Step 6] The user clicked on an SVG element located at x = 889, y = 695.
   7) [Step 7] The user clicked on various elements within a form (ImageDrag image here or click to uploadCategoryStartersMain CoursesDessertsDrinksSide DishesNameDescriptionccPrice (€)Available for orderCancelSave Changes) but did not interact with any of the input fields or submit the form.

   9) [Step 9] The user clicked on an SVG element located at x = 1420, y = 338.
   At this point, the user did not complete any of the initiated tasks (uploading an image or adding a new menu item), so the session was classified as a drop-off. It is important to note that all logs were considered in this decision.
