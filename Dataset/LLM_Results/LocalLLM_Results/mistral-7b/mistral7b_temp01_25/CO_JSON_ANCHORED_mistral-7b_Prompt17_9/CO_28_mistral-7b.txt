==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user initiated a login process (form_submit event), but did not complete any subsequent tasks such as clicking the "Sign In" button or entering a password. Instead, they only entered a value into the password field and then blurred it, which suggests that they may have abandoned the login process.

   User Journey:
   1) [Step 1] The user navigated to the restaurant's login page (route: /restaurant/login).
   2) [Step 2] The user entered their username or email address into the username field (input_change event).
   3) [Step 3] The user did not provide a password, but instead clicked on the "Sign In" button (click event). However, this was not a form_submit event, suggesting that the user may have cancelled the action.
   4) [Step 4] The user entered a value into the password field (input_change event), but did not complete the login process by clicking the "Sign In" button again or submitting the form. Instead, they blurred the password field and no further actions were recorded.
   Note: All initiated tasks were not completed, so the session was classified as a drop-off. It's important to consider all logs to the end to make an informed decision.
