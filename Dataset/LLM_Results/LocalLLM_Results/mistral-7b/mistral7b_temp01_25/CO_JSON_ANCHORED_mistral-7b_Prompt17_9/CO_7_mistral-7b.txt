==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user initiated a task (clicking on the "Customer Login" link) but did not complete it by entering their username or password. This indicates that they abandoned the session before completing the login process.

  1) [Step 1] User navigated to the homepage of the website.
  2) [Step 2] User clicked on the "Customer Login" link located at the top right corner of the page.
  3) [Step 3] User clicked on the username input field but did not enter any text, indicating they may have intended to type their username but did not.
  4) [Step 4] User clicked outside the username input field, which suggests they might have decided to leave the login process.
  5) [Step 5] User clicked on the form containing the username and password fields, but again did not enter any text, indicating they may have intended to type their password but did not.
  6) [Step 6] The user's session ended without any further interaction, suggesting a drop-off.

   All initiated tasks were not completed, so the session was classified as a drop-off. It is important to note that this analysis is based on the provided logs and does not consider external factors such as website performance issues or user distractions that may have contributed to the drop-off.
