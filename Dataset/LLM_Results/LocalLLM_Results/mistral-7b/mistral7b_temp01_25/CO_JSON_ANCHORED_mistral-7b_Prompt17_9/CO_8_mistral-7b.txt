 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user initiated the task of clicking on the "Customer Login" link, but did not complete the subsequent tasks such as entering a username and password. This indicates that the user abandoned the session before completing the login process.

   User Journey:
   1) [Step 1] The user navigated to the homepage of the website ("http://localhost:5173/customer/login").
   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "Customer Login" link located at x = 627, y = 38.
   3) [Step 3] The user clicked on the username input field (x = 515, y = 306). This indicates that the user intended to enter their username. However, no further logs show the user entering any text into this field or clicking the password input field.
   4) [Step 4] The user clicked on an empty area of the page (x = 563, y = 289), which could have been intended to select the username field again or as a mistake.
   5) No further logs show the user taking any action that would indicate they completed the login process.

   All initiated tasks were not completed, so the session was classified as a drop-off. It is important to note that this analysis is based on the provided log file and does not consider any other factors such as user behavior patterns or website design elements that may influence user engagement.
