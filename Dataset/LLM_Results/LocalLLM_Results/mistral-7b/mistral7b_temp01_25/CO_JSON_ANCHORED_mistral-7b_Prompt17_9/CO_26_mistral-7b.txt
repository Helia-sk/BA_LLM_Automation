 Tag: Conversion

   Reason: The user initiated a task (clicking on "Add Item") and completed it by clicking on "Saladmixvery healthy€0.08". This indicates that the user has successfully added an item to their cart, which is one of the tasks required for a conversion. No other initiated tasks were abandoned in this log file.

   1) The user landed on the restaurant's dashboard page (/restaurant/dashboard/menu).
   2) The user scrolled down the menu items and hovered over an image upload area, suggesting they might want to add or change an item. However, no action was recorded for this.
   3) The user clicked on "Add Item", indicating they wanted to add a new item to their cart.
   4) The user selected an item ("Saladmixvery healthy€0.08") and clicked on it, which added the item to their cart.
   5) The user then navigated away from the page, possibly to complete the checkout process or continue browsing other items.

   I have considered all the logs in this file to make my decision.
