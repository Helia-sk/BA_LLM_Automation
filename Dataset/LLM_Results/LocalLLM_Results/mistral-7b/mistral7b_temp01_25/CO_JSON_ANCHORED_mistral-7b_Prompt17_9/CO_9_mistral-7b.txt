==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user initiated a task (scrolling down the page) but did not complete it, indicating potential interest that was not fully engaged. However, since we have not observed any other tasks being completed, such as clicking on the "Restaurant 4" image or navigating to another restaurant's page, we cannot definitively say whether this session was a conversion or not.

   Here is the user journey step-by-step:
   1) [Step 1] The user visited the customer dashboard page (http://localhost:5173/customer/dashboard).
   2) [Step 2] The user scrolled down the page, indicating potential interest in the content.
   3) [Step 3] The user reached the "Restaurant 4" section and did not interact with it (no click on the image or navigation to another restaurant's page).
   4) [Step 4] The user continued scrolling down the page, reaching a point where they scrolled back up (indicated by two consecutive scroll events with different y-coordinates).
   5) [Step 5] The user clicked on the "Restaurants" link at the top of the page, suggesting they might have intended to navigate to another restaurant. However, no further logs suggest a navigation event occurred.
   6) [Step 6] The user scrolled down the page again, indicating potential interest in the content, but did not interact with any other elements before leaving the session (no further logs were recorded).

   It is important to note that we cannot definitively say whether this session was a conversion or not based on the provided logs. Further analysis of additional user behavior and context would be necessary to make a conclusive determination.
