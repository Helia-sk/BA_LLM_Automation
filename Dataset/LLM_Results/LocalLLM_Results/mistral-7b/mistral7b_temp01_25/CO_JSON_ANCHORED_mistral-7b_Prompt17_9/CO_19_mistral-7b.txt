==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user initiated a task (clicking on the "Customer Login" link) but did not complete it. Instead, they navigated away from the page without performing any further actions related to the login process.

   1) [Step 1] The user was on the restaurant dashboard settings page (indicated by the log with session_id: session_1758982735683_6tqp38avs and route: "/restaurant/dashboard/settings").
   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "Customer Login" link (indicated by the log with attempt_id: log_1758982745841_zt9tbfo0t).
   3) [Step 3] The user navigated to the home page (indicated by the log with attempt_id: log_1758982735683_nn4i1w1qb and route: "/"). This action suggests that they did not complete the login process, hence classifying this session as a drop-off.

   It is important to note that I have considered all the logs provided in making this decision. The user did not perform any actions related to the login form after clicking on the "Customer Login" link, which indicates that they abandoned the task.
