 Tag: Conversion

   Reason: The user initiated the task of clicking on the "Customer Login" button, and subsequently performed actions related to filling out the username field. Although there is no explicit log for submitting the form, the user's interaction with the username input field suggests that they intended to complete the login process. Since all initiated tasks were completed (clicking the "Customer Login" button and interacting with the username input), we can classify this session as a conversion.

   1) The user visited the homepage of the application.
   2) The user clicked on the "Customer Login" button, initiating the login process.
   3) The user navigated to the login page and interacted with the username input field, indicating an intention to fill out their username.
