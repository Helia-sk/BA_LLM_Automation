 Tag: Conversion

   Reason: The user initiated the task of navigating to the Customer Login page (log 10), clicked on the username input field (logs 9, 8), entered their username (logs 7, 6), and then clicked on the password input field (logs 5, 4). After that, the user entered their password (logs 3, 2) and finally clicked the login button (log 1). All initiated tasks were completed, so this session can be classified as a conversion.

   1) The user navigated to the Customer Login page (log 10).
   2) The user clicked on the username input field (logs 9, 8).
   3) The user entered their username (logs 7, 6).
