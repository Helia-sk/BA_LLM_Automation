 Tag: Conversion

   Reason: The user initiated a task (scrolling down the page) and completed it by scrolling to the bottom of the page. After that, the user clicked on an element ("No image available") which could be considered as interacting with content, indicating engagement. Later, the user scrolled back up to the top of the page, then clicked on another element ("Restaurant 4"), and finally scrolled down again. This sequence suggests that the user was actively exploring the content and completing tasks, which is consistent with a conversion.

   1) The user landed on the dashboard page (/customer/dashboard).
   2) The user scrolled down the page to view more content.
   3) The user clicked on an image placeholder ("No image available").
   4) The user scrolled back up to the top of the page.
   5) The user clicked on a restaurant listing ("Restaurant 4").
   6) The user scrolled down to view more details about the selected restaurant.

   All the logs were considered in this analysis, and the decision was based on the completion of all initiated tasks (scrolling and clicking).
