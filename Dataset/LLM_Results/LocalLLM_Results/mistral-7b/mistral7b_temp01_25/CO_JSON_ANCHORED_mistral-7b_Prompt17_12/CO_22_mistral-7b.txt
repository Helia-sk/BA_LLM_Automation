==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user initiated tasks (clicking on the "Restaurant Partners" link and filling in the username field) but did not complete the task of entering a password, which is indicated by the absence of a corresponding log entry for the password input.

1) [Step 1] The user visited the restaurant login page ("/restaurant/login").
2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "Restaurant Partners" link to register or log in.
3) [Step 3] The user entered a username ("User1") into the username input field.
4) [Step 4] The user did not enter a password, indicating that they abandoned the task of logging in or registering.
5) [Step 5] The user left the page without completing any further tasks.

All initiated tasks were not completed, so the session was classified as a drop-off. It is important to note that all logs were considered in this decision.
