==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user initiated a task (clicking on the "Customer Login" link) but did not complete it. Instead, they clicked on the form and input field, but no further interaction was recorded that would indicate completion of the login process.

   1) [Step 1] User navigated to the homepage ("http://localhost:5173/").
   2) [Step 2] User clicked on the "Customer Login" link located at x = 633, y = 35.
   3) [Step 3] User clicked on the form element with id "username".
   4) [Step 4] User clicked on the input field with id "password". (This step is not explicitly shown in the logs but can be inferred as a typical sequence after clicking on the form.)
   5) [Step 5] No further interaction was recorded that would indicate completion of the login process.
   Note: The logs do not show any subsequent actions such as submitting the form or navigating to another page, which suggests that the user may have abandoned the session. However, it is also possible that the logs did not capture all interactions due to technical limitations or errors. Therefore, it is important to consider this possibility when making decisions based on log data.
