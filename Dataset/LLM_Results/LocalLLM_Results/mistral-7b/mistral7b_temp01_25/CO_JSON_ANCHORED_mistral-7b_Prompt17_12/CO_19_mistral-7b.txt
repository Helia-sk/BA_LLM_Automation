==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user initiated a task (clicking on the "Customer Login" link) but did not complete it. Instead, they navigated away from the page without performing any other actions that could be considered part of the conversion process.

   User Journey:
   1) [Step 1] The user was on the restaurant dashboard settings page (indicated by the log with session_id "session_1758982735683_6tqp38avs").
   2) [Step 2] The user navigated to the customer login page by clicking on the "Customer Login" link (log with event_time "2025-09-27T14:19:05.841Z").
   3) [Step 3] The user clicked on an input field in the customer login form but did not enter any information or submit the form (log with event_time "2025-09-27T14:19:06.939Z").
   4) [Step 4] The user clicked outside of the input field, possibly indicating they decided to abandon the login process (log with event_time "2025-09-27T14:19:06.939Z").
   5) [Step 5] The user navigated away from the customer login page and back to the restaurant dashboard settings page, indicating they did not complete the conversion process (log with event_time "2025-09-27T14:19:06.939Z").
   It is important to note that the user did not perform any other actions that could be considered part of the conversion process after clicking on the "Customer Login" link, which is why this session is classified as a drop-off.
