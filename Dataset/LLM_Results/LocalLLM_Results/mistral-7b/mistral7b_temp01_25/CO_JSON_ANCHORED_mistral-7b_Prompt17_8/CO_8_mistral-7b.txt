   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "Customer Login" link located at x = 627, y = 38.
   3) [Step 3] The user clicked on the username input field but did not enter any data.
   4) [Step 4] The user clicked on the password input field but did not enter any data.
   5) [Step 5] The user did not click on the "Login" button, indicating that they abandoned the session.

   All the initiated tasks were not completed, so the session was a drop-off. It is important to note that all the logs provided in the log file were considered in this decision.
