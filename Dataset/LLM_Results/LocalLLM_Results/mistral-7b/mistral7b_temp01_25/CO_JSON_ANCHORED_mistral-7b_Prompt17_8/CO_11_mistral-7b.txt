==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user initiated a task (scrolling down the page) but did not complete it, indicating that they left the site without completing the intended action. This is evident from the logs where the scroll event was initiated multiple times but the user never scrolled to the bottom of the page or clicked on any other interactive elements.

  1) [Step 1] The user accessed the customer dashboard page (/customer/dashboard).
  2) [Step 2] The user scrolled down the page, indicating they were exploring the content.
  3) [Step 3] The user continued to scroll down the page, but did not reach the bottom or click on any other interactive elements. This suggests that they left the site without completing any tasks.

   It is important to note that all logs in this session pertain to the same user and the same page (customer dashboard), which means that no other initiated tasks were completed during this session. Therefore, based on the provided conditions, this session can be classified as a drop-off.
