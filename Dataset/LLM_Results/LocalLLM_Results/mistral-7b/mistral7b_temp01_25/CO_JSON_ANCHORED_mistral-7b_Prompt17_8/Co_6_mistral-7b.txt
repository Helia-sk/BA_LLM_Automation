 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user initiated the task of clicking on the "Customer Login" link, but did not complete the subsequent tasks such as entering a username and password. Instead, the user clicked away from the form without submitting it.

   1) [Step 1] The user navigated to the homepage of the website.
   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "Customer Login" link located at the top right corner of the page.
   3) [Step 3] The user clicked on the username input field, but did not enter any text.
   4) [Step 4] The user clicked away from the form without submitting it or entering a password.
   Note: The logs do not show any subsequent actions by the user, indicating that they may have left the website after this point. It is also possible that the user encountered an issue with the login process and decided to leave the site without attempting to resolve it. However, without additional context or information about the website's behavior, it is difficult to be certain about the exact reason for the drop-off.
