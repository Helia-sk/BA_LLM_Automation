 Tag: Conversion

   Reason: The user initiated a task (clicking on "Customer Login") and completed it by entering their username and password, indicating a successful login. After logging in, they did not abandon any other tasks, suggesting that they continued with the intended action.

   1) [Step 1] The user navigated to the homepage ("/") from another page ("http://localhost:5173/restaurant/dashboard/settings").
   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "Customer Login" link, initiating the login process.
   3) [Step 3] The user entered their username and password in the provided input fields.
   4) [Step 4] The user successfully logged in by clicking the login button (not shown in the log).
   5) [Step 5] The user did not abandon any other tasks, indicating they continued with their intended action after logging in.

   All initiated tasks were completed, hence the session was a conversion. I have considered all the logs provided to make this decision.
