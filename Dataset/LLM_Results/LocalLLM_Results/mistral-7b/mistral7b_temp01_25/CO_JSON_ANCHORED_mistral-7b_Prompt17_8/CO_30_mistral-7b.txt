==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user initiated a task (clicked on "History") but did not complete it by clicking on "View Details". This indicates that the user abandoned the task.

   1) [Step 1] The user navigated to the restaurant dashboard page (http://localhost:5173/restaurant/dashboard).
   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "History" link located at x = 676, y = 126.
   3) [Step 3] The user arrived at the history page (http://localhost:5173/restaurant/dashboard/history).
   4) [Step 4] The user clicked on the "View Details" button but did not complete the action, instead they clicked on the "Reject" button.
   5) [Step 5] The user clicked on the "History" link again to go back to the history page.
   6) [Step 6] The user clicked on the "X" button to close the history page and returned to the dashboard page.
   7) [Step 7] The user clicked on the "Reject" button located at x = 1538, y = 298.
   8) [Step 8] The user clicked on the "X" button to close the reject modal and remained on the dashboard page.
   9) [Step 9] The user clicked on the "Reject" button again to confirm their decision.
   Note: Although the user did not complete the task of viewing details, they interacted with multiple elements on the page, indicating some level of engagement. However, since the primary initiated task was abandoned, the session is classified as a drop-off.
