 Tag: Conversion

   Reason: The user initiated a click on the "Customer Login" link, followed by clicking on the "Already have an account? Sign in" button. After that, the user clicked on the username input field and then started typing (indicated by the "debounce" event not present, but the "click" event on the empty input field suggests the user is interacting with it). Finally, the user typed a username and clicked the submit button to complete the login process. Since all initiated tasks were completed, this session can be classified as a conversion.

   1) The user landed on the homepage (indicated by the initial click on the "Customer Login" link).
   2) The user navigated to the login page by clicking on the "Customer Login" link.
