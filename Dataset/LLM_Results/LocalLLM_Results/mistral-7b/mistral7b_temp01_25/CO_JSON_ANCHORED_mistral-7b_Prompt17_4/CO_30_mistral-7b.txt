==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user initiated a task (clicked on "History") but did not complete it by clicking on any of the subsequent options. Instead, they clicked on the "Reject" button, indicating that they decided to leave without completing the intended action.

   1) [Step 1] The user navigated to the restaurant dashboard page (/restaurant/dashboard).
   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "History" link located at x = 676, y = 126.
   3) [Step 3] The user clicked on the "Reject" button located at x = 1538, y = 298. This action indicates that they decided to leave without viewing the details of any history item.
   Note: Although the user did not complete all initiated tasks, it is important to consider every log in the analysis. The logs show that the user navigated to the dashboard page and clicked on the "History" link, but did not click on any other links or buttons after that. This suggests that they were not interested in viewing the history details and decided to leave the page. Therefore, the session was a drop-off.
