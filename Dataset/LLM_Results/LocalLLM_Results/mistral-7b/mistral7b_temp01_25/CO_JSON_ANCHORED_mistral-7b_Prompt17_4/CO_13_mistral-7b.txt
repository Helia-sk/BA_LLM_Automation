==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user initiated a task (clicking on "History") but did not complete it by clicking on any of the subsequent options such as "View Details". Instead, they clicked on the "X" button which is typically used to close a window or dismiss an option. This suggests that the user may have decided to leave the page without completing their intended action.

  1) [Step 1] The user navigated to the restaurant dashboard page (URL: http://localhost:5173/restaurant/dashboard/history).
  2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "History" option, indicating an interest in viewing the history of orders or events.
  3) [Step 3] Instead of clicking on a specific order to view details, the user clicked on the "X" button, which is not typically associated with interacting with the history section. This action suggests that the user may have decided to leave the page without completing their intended action (viewing the details of an order).
  4) [Step 4] The user did not perform any other actions that could be considered as part of a conversion process, such as clicking on "View Details" for another order or making a new order.
  5) [Step 5] The session ended without any further interaction from the user.

   It is important to note that all logs were considered in this decision-making process. The user did not complete any of the initiated tasks, so the session was classified as a drop-off.
