 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user initiated a task (clicking on "Customer Login") but did not complete it, as indicated by the subsequent logs showing navigation away from the login page.

   1) [Step 1] The user navigated to the restaurant dashboard settings page ("/restaurant/dashboard/settings").
   2) [Step 2] The user then left the application, as indicated by a new session being initiated (session_1758982735683_6tqp38avs).
   3) [Step 3] In the new session, the user navigated to the home page ("/").
   4) [Step 4] The user then clicked on the "Customer Login" link. However, this was not followed by any further interaction related to the login process.
   5) [Step 5] The user left the application again, as indicated by another new session being initiated (session_1758982746939_7qttgtuwg).
   It should be noted that while the user did not complete the login process, they did navigate to the home page and click on the "Customer Login" link, indicating some level of engagement with the application. However, since the login process was not completed, this session is classified as a drop-off.
