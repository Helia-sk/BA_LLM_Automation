 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user initiated a task (scrolling down the page) but did not complete it, indicating potential interest that was not fully engaged. Later, the user clicked on an element (No image available), but this does not constitute a conversion as it is unclear what action was intended after this click. The user then scrolled further down the page, but again did not complete any tasks, suggesting a drop-off.

  1) [Step 1] User arrived at the customer dashboard page (http://localhost:5173/customer/dashboard).
  2) [Step 2] User scrolled down the page (indicating potential interest).
  3) [Step 3] User clicked on an image placeholder with the text "No image available".
  4) [Step 4] User continued scrolling down the page, but did not interact with any other elements.
  5) [Step 5] User scrolled further down the page, but again did not interact with any elements, suggesting a drop-off.

   All initiated tasks (scrolling and clicking on an image placeholder) were not completed, which meets the condition for a drop-off.
