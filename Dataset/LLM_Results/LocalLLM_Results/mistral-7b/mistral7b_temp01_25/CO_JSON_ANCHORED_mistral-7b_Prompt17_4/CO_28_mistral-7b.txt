==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user initiated a login process (form_submit event), but did not complete any subsequent tasks such as clicking the "Sign In" button or entering a password. Instead, the session ended with an input_change event on the password field, which suggests that the user may have abandoned the login process without completing it.

   User Journey:
   1) [Step 1] The user navigated to the restaurant's website (implied by the first log being a form_submit event).
   2) [Step 2] The user initiated the login process by submitting the login form (form_submit event).
   3) [Step 3] The user did not complete the login process. Instead, an input_change event was recorded on the password field, suggesting that the user may have abandoned the login process without entering a password or clicking the "Sign In" button.
   Note: All logs were considered in this analysis.
