 Tag: Drop-Off

   Reason: The user initiated a task (clicking on the "Menu" link) but did not complete it, instead scrolling and clicking elsewhere on the page. This indicates that the user did not find what they were looking for in the menu or got distracted by other elements on the page.

   1) [Step 1] The user accessed the restaurant dashboard (URL: http://localhost:5173/restaurant/dashboard/menu).
   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "Menu" link located at x=571, y=125.
   3) [Step 3] The user scrolled down the page to position y=81.
   4) [Step 4] The user scrolled further down the page to position y=0 (log_1758985431599_x7th5obah).
   5) [Step 5] The user clicked somewhere else on the page, triggering a "click" event at x=1134, y=588 (log_1758985435886_4l55g8a0y).

   All initiated tasks were not completed, hence the session was a drop-off. The user did not find what they were looking for in the menu and got distracted by other elements on the page.
