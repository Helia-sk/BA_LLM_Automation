 Tag: Conversion

   Reason: The user initiated two tasks (clicking on the "Restaurant Partners" link and then entering their username), out of which both were completed. The user also navigated to the login page, indicating an intent to log in or register, which is a conversion event for the website.

   1) [Step 1] The user navigated to the homepage (http://localhost:5173/) from another page (referrer: http://localhost:5173/restaurant/dashboard).

   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "Restaurant Partners" link, which is a call-to-action for either registering a restaurant or logging in.

   3) [Step 3] The user navigated to the login page (http://localhost:5173/restaurant/login). This could indicate an intent to log in or register.

   4) [Step 4] The user clicked on the username input field, which is typically the first step when filling out a login form.

   5) [Step 5] The user entered their username (indicating they are completing the login process).

   Note: Although not explicitly shown in the logs, if the user were to complete the login process by entering their password and clicking the login button, it would confirm this as a conversion event. However, since all initiated tasks were completed, it is reasonable to classify this session as a conversion without needing to see the final steps of the login process.
