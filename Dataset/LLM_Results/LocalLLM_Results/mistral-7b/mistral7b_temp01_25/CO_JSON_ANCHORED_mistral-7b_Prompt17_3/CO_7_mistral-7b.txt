==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off

   Reason: The user initiated a task (clicking on the "Customer Login" link) but did not complete it. Instead, they clicked on the form and input field, but no further interaction was recorded that would indicate a successful login or any other completed task.

   1) [Step 1] User navigated to the homepage ("http://localhost:5173/").
   2) [Step 2] User clicked on the "Customer Login" link located at x=633, y=35.
   3) [Step 3] User clicked on the form element with id "username".
   4) [Step 4] User clicked on the input field with id "password". (This step is not explicitly shown in the logs but can be inferred as a typical sequence after clicking the form.)
   5) No further interaction was recorded that would indicate a successful login or any other completed task.

   Note: All initiated tasks were not completed, so the session was classified as a drop-off. However, it's important to consider that the logs might be incomplete or missing some interactions, which could potentially change the classification if more data becomes available.
