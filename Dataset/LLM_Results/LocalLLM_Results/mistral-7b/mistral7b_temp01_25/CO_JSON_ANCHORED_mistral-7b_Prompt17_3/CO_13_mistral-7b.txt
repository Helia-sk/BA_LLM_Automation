 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user initiated a task (clicking on "History") but did not complete it by clicking on "View Details". Instead, they clicked on the "X" button which is typically used to close or cancel an action. This indicates that the user did not want to proceed with viewing the details of their history.

  1) [Step 1] The user accessed the restaurant dashboard page (route: /restaurant/dashboard/history).
  2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "History" link to view their order history.
  3) [Step 3] The user saw the list of orders and clicked on the "X" button instead of clicking on any specific order to view its details, indicating that they did not want to proceed with viewing the details of their history.

All initiated tasks were considered in this analysis. The user did not complete all tasks (viewing the details of an order), hence the session was classified as a drop-off.
