 Tag: Conversion

   Reason: The user initiated a task (clicking on the "Restaurant Login" link) and completed it by entering their username and password, indicating that they successfully logged in. They also clicked on the "Already have an account? Sign in" button, but this does not constitute an abandoned task as it is expected behavior for users who are already registered to click on this link.

   1) The user navigated to the Restaurant Login page (indicated by the first click event).
   2) The user clicked on the "Restaurant Login" link, initiating the login process.
   3) The user entered their username and password in the respective input fields.
