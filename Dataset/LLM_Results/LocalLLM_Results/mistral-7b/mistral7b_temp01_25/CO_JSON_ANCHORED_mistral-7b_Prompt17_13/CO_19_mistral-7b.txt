==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user initiated a task (clicking on the "Customer Login" button) but did not complete it, as indicated by the subsequent logs showing no further interaction related to the login process.

   1) [Step 1] The user navigated from the restaurant dashboard settings page to the homepage ("/") at 2025-09-27T14:18:55.683Z.
   2) [Step 2] At 2025-09-27T14:19:05.841Z, the user clicked on the "Customer Login" link, indicating an intention to start the login process.
   3) [Step 3] The user then clicked on the username input field at 2025-09-27T14:19:06.939Z, but no further interaction related to entering a username or password was recorded.
   4) [Step 4] No subsequent logs show any interaction related to the login process, suggesting that the user did not complete the task and instead abandoned it.

   I have considered all the logs provided in my analysis. The user initiated the login process but did not complete it, which meets the criteria for a drop-off.
