==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user initiated a task (scrolling down the page) but did not complete it, indicating potential interest that was not fully engaged. However, since we have not observed any other tasks being completed in this session, we cannot definitively confirm a conversion.

   User Journey:
   1) [Step 1] The user visited the homepage (http://localhost:5173/customer/dashboard).
   2) [Step 2] The user scrolled down the page (scroll event at 2025-09-13T14:32:58.615Z and 2025-09-13T14:32:57.591Z).
   3) [Step 3] The user clicked on an image (click event at 2025-09-13T14:32:58.615Z), but it appears to be a placeholder for no image available, suggesting the user might have expected to see an actual image and found none, potentially leading to disengagement.
   4) [Step 4] The user scrolled further down the page (scroll event at 2025-09-13T14:32:58.718Z), but again, this action was not followed by any other interactions that would indicate task completion.
   5) [Step 5] The user clicked on an element within the page (click event at 2025-09-13T14:32:58.718Z), but the details provided do not specify what was clicked, making it difficult to determine if this could have been a task completion or not.
   6) [Step 6] The user scrolled up the page (scroll event at 2025-09-13T14:32:58.615Z), suggesting potential reconsideration or navigation away from the page, but no further interactions were observed.
   7) [Step 7] The user scrolled down the page again (scroll event at 2025-09-13T14:32:58.718Z), possibly indicating continued interest or exploration, but this was not followed by any other interactions.
   8) [Step 8] The user did not perform any other actions in the session, suggesting potential drop-off.
