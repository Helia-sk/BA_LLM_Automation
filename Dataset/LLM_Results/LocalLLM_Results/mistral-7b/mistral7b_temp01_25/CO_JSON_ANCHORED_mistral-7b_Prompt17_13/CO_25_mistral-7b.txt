 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user initiated a task (clicking on the "Menu" link) but did not complete it, instead scrolling and clicking elsewhere on the page. This indicates that the user may have lost interest or encountered an issue, leading to a drop-off.

   1) [Step 1] User accessed the restaurant dashboard at http://localhost:5173/restaurant/dashboard/menu with browser version web-1.4.2.
   2) [Step 2] User clicked on the "Menu" link located at x=571, y=125.
   3) [Step 3] User scrolled down the page to y=81 and then continued scrolling further.
   4) [Step 4] User performed a scroll event again, indicating they were still interacting with the page.
   5) [Step 5] The user clicked somewhere else on the page (an SVG element at x=1134, y=588), which was not part of the intended user journey.
   After considering all the logs, it appears that the user initiated a task by clicking on the "Menu" link but did not complete it, leading to a drop-off.
