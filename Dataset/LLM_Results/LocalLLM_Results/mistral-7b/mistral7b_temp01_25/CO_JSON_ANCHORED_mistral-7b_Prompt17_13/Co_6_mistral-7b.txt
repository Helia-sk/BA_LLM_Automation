==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user initiated a task (clicking on the "Customer Login" link) but did not complete it by entering their username and password, which indicates that they abandoned the process.

   1) [Step 1] User navigated to the homepage of the website.
   2) [Step 2] User clicked on the "Customer Login" link located at the top right corner of the page.
   3) [Step 3] User clicked on the username input field, indicating they were about to enter their username. However, no log shows that they actually entered any text in the field.
   4) [Step 4] The user did not click on the password input field or the login button, which suggests that they abandoned the login process.
   5) [Step 5] The user clicked outside of the username input field, but no further interaction was recorded, indicating that they left the page without completing the login process.

All initiated tasks were not completed, so the session was a drop-off. It is important to note that all logs have been considered in this analysis.
