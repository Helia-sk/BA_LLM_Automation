 Tag: Conversion

   Reason: The user initiated the task of navigating to the Customer Login page and then interacted with the username input field by clicking on it twice, which indicates an attempt to enter their credentials. After that, the user clicked on the "Customer Login" button, which is typically the final step in a login process. Since all initiated tasks were completed, this session can be classified as a conversion.
