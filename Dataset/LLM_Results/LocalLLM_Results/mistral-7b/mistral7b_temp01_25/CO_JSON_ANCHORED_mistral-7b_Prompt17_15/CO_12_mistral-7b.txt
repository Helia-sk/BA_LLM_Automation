 Tag: Conversion

   Reason: The user initiated a task (clicking on the "Menu" link) and completed it by navigating to the "Menu" page. After that, the user initiated another task (clicking on the "Add Item" button), which is considered as an action to add an item to the menu, indicating an intent to complete a transaction or make a change in the system.
