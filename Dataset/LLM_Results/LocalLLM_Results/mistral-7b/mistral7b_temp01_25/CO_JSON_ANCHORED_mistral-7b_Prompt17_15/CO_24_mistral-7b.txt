==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: One of the initiated tasks (uploading an image for a menu item) was abandoned, as no subsequent logs indicate that this task was completed.

   1) [Step 1] The user navigated to the restaurant dashboard page (/restaurant/dashboard/menu).
   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "Menu" link in the navigation bar.
   3) [Step 3] The user clicked on the "ImageDrag image here or click to upload" area within the form for adding a new menu item.
   4) [Step 4] The user clicked outside of the form, indicating they may have decided not to proceed with adding a new menu item (abandoned task).
   5) [Step 5] No subsequent logs indicate that the user completed any other tasks on the page or navigated away from it.
   Note: All logs were considered in this analysis. The user did not complete all initiated tasks, so the session was classified as a drop-off.
