==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user initiated tasks by clicking on "Balance" and then "Orders", but did not complete any of those tasks. Instead, they clicked on "Orders" again, which suggests that they might have intended to view their orders but left the page without doing so. This is further supported by the subsequent clicks on "View Details" and "Orders" again, which were also not followed through.

  1) The user logged into the customer dashboard.
  2) The user clicked on the "Balance" link to view their account balance.
  3) The user then clicked on the "Orders" link to view their order history.
  4) Instead of viewing their orders, the user clicked on the "View Details" button for an order, but did not actually view the details.
  5) The user clicked on the "Orders" link again, suggesting they might have intended to view their orders a second time, but left the page without doing so.
  6) The user did not perform any other actions in the log file, indicating that they dropped off from the session.
