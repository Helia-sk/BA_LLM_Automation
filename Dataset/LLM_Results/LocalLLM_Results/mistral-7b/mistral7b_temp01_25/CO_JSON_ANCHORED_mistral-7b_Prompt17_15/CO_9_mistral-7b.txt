 Tag: Conversion

   Reason: The user initiated a task (scrolling down the page) and completed it by scrolling to the bottom of the page. After that, the user clicked on an element ("No image available") which could be considered as interacting with content, indicating engagement. Later, the user scrolled back up to the top of the page, then clicked on another element ("Restaurant 4"), and finally scrolled down again to the bottom of the page. This sequence suggests that the user was actively exploring the content and completing tasks, which is consistent with a conversion.

   1) The user landed on the dashboard page (/customer/dashboard).
   2) Scrolled down the page.
   3) Clicked on an element ("Restaurant 4").
   4) Scrolled back up to the top of the page.
   5) Scrolled down again to the bottom of the page.
   6) Clicked on another element ("No image available").
   7) Scrolled back up to the top of the page (this could be due to navigation or further exploration).
   8) The session ended, but no abandoned tasks were identified in the provided logs.

   All the initiated tasks were completed, which supports the classification as a conversion.
