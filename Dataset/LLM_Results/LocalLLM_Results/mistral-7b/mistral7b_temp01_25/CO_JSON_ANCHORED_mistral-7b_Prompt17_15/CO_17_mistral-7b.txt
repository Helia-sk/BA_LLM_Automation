 Tag: Conversion

   Reason: The user initiated a task (clicking on "Restaurants") and completed it by clicking on a specific restaurant ("No image available"). After that, the user clicked on another task ("Add to Cart"), which indicates an intention to purchase. Finally, the user completed the checkout process by clicking on "Checkout" and "Paid". Since all initiated tasks were completed, this session can be classified as a conversion.

   1) The user landed on the customer dashboard.
   2) The user clicked on the "Restaurants" link.
   3) The user scrolled down to view restaurant details.
   4) The user clicked on a specific restaurant ("No image available").
   5) The user scrolled up and initiated the "Add to Cart" task by clicking on the "Add to Cart" button for that restaurant.
   6) The user was redirected to the cart page.
   7) The user initiated the checkout process by clicking on the "Checkout" button.
   8) The user completed the checkout process by providing necessary details and clicking on the "Paid" button.
   I have considered all the logs in my decision making, as each log represents a distinct action taken by the user during the session.
