 Tag: Conversion
   Reason: The user initiated a task (scrolling, clicking) throughout the session and completed it by visiting multiple restaurant pages (`/customer/dashboard/restaurant/4`) and interacting with the elements there. Towards the end, the user clicked on the "Restaurants" link (`/customer/dashboard`) which is an indication of navigation back to the main page, but this does not count as a new task as it was a revisit to the previously visited page. The user did not abandon any initiated tasks.
