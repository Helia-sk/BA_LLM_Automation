 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: Although the user initiated the task of clicking on the "Customer Login" link, they did not complete the subsequent tasks such as entering a username and password. The user also clicked on the username input field but did not proceed to enter any data in it. The session was abandoned before completing all the necessary steps for a conversion.

   User Journey:
   1) [Step 1] The user navigated to the customer login page by clicking on the "Customer Login" link.
   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the username input field but did not enter any data in it.
   3) [Step 3] The user clicked on the password input field, but there is no further activity indicating that they entered a password or submitted the form.
   4) [Step 4] The session ended without completing the necessary steps for a conversion, which suggests that the user abandoned the process.
