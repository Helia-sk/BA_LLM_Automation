==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user initiated the task of navigating to the "Customer Login" page, but this was the last action performed during the session. No subsequent actions were taken that would indicate completion of a task such as logging in or performing an action on the customer login page.

  1) [Step 1] The user started a new session by visiting the homepage ("/").
  2) [Step 2] The user scrolled down the page to view its content.
  3) [Step 3] The user clicked on the "Customer Login" link located at the top of the page.
  4) No further actions were performed, indicating that the session ended without completing any initiated tasks.

The logs provided in this example do not show any activity beyond the navigation to the customer login page, so it is not possible to confirm if all initiated tasks were completed or if one was abandoned. However, since no completion of a task was observed, it can be classified as a drop-off session.
