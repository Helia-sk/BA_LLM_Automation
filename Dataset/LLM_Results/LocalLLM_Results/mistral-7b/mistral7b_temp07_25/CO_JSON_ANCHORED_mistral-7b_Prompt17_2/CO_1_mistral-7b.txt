==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user initiated a task (clicking on "Customer Login") but did not complete another initiated task (entering a username). This indicates that the user dropped off during the session.

   User Journey:
   1) [Step 1] The user navigated to the website ("http://localhost:5173/").
   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "Customer Login" button (log_1757772472157).
   3) [Step 3] The user clicked on a username input field but did not enter any data (log_1757772473391 and log_1757772475335).
   [This step indicates that the user dropped off as they did not complete another initiated task.]

   Note: All logs were considered in this decision making process. The user did not complete any other tasks beyond clicking on the username input field, so the session was classified as a drop-off.
