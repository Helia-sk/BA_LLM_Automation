==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user initiated a task (scrolling through the page) but did not complete it, as indicated by multiple scroll events without any other significant actions such as clicking on links or buttons. Additionally, there is no evidence of the user completing the final step in the user journey (viewing a specific section of the page or performing an action like submitting a form).

  1) [Step 1] The user started a new session by accessing the customer dashboard page ("/customer/dashboard").
  2) [Step 2] The user scrolled through the page, reaching as far as the middle of the content.
  3) [Step 3] The user continued to scroll down further but did not interact with any links or buttons or perform any other significant actions.
  4) [Step 4] The user scrolled back up and then scrolled down again, indicating they were still exploring the page but did not complete their intended task.
  5) [Step 5] The user's session ended without completing any initiated tasks.

The analysis is based on all the provided logs, and it does not make any assumptions about the user's intentions or actions outside of what is observed in the log file.
