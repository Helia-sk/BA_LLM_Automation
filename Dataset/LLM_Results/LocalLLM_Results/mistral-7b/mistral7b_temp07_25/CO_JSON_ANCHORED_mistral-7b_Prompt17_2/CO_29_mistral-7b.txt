 Tag: Conversion

   Reason: The user initiated two tasks (History and View Details), and completed both of them, indicating a successful interaction with the application.

   1) [Step 1] The user clicked on the "History" button in the dashboard.
   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "View Details" button for a specific history item.
   3) [Step 3] The user closed the session by clicking the "X" button, which is a common action to end a session without causing an abandonment. However, since all initiated tasks were completed, it does not affect the classification of this session as a conversion.
