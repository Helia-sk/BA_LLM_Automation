   2) [Step 2] User clicked on the "Restaurant Partners" link to register or log in.
   3) [Step 3] User entered a username ("User1") into the username input field.
   4) [Step 4] User clicked on the username input field (indicating they intended to enter a password). However, the user did not complete this action and left the session without clicking the login button. The session was dropped off before completing all initiated tasks.
