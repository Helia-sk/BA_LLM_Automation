==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: Although the user initiated tasks such as clicking on the "Add Item" button, the user did not complete any of the subsequent steps like uploading an image or providing a description for the item. This indicates that the user abandoned the task, hence classifying this session as a drop-off.

   User Journey:
   1) [Step 1] The user accessed the restaurant's menu dashboard.
   2) [Step 2] The user navigated to the "Add Item" section.
   3) [Step 3] The user clicked on the "Add Item" button, initiating the process of adding a new menu item. However, the user did not proceed with the subsequent steps (uploading an image or providing a description).
   As we have observed that one of the initiated tasks was abandoned, this session is classified as a drop-off.
