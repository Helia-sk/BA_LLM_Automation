==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: While we cannot be certain that the user has abandoned the session, there is no record of completion for any of the initiated tasks. The user clicked on the "Menu" link and navigated to the "/restaurant/dashboard/menu" page, but no subsequent interaction with the form or image upload was recorded.

   User Journey:
   1) [Step 1] User opened the webpage (url not specified in logs).
   2) [Step 2] User clicked on the "Menu" link located at x = 586, y = 124.
   3) [Step 3] User navigated to the "/restaurant/dashboard/menu" page.
   4) (No further interaction with any initiated tasks was recorded).

   The user did not complete any of the tasks they initiated (uploading an image or saving changes to the menu), so we classify this session as a drop-off. However, it is worth noting that there may be additional information missing from the provided logs that could change this classification. For example, if the user completed their actions on another page not included in these logs, this would change our conclusion.
