 Tag: Conversion
   Reason: All initiated tasks were completed. The user clicked on the "History" link (initiated task 1), then clicked on the "View Details" button (initiated task 2), and finally, they performed an action that led to a page view (initiated task 3). No initiated tasks were abandoned.

   User Journey:
   1) The user navigated to the restaurant dashboard page (/restaurant/dashboard).
   2) The user clicked on the "History" link, which took them to the history section of the dashboard.
   3) The user clicked on the "View Details" button for one of the items in the history section.
   4) The user viewed the details of that item (a page view was recorded).
   It should be noted that the user also rejected an item by clicking the "Reject" button but this does not affect the conversion classification as it is not considered an initiated task. Additionally, the user clicked on the "Back" button to return to the history section and eventually clicked the "X" button to exit the page (these actions do not initiate new tasks). All the logs were considered in making this decision.
