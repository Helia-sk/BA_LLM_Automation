 Tag: Conversion

   Reason: All the initiated tasks were completed. The user clicked on the "Customer Login" link, which triggered a click event. Then, the user interacted with the username input field by clicking it twice, indicating an attempt to enter their credentials. After that, the user clicked on the password input field, which is a common action when filling out login forms. Lastly, the user submitted the form by clicking the submit button. Since all initiated tasks were completed, this session can be classified as a conversion.

   1) The user navigated to the customer login page by clicking the "Customer Login" link. (Log 9: app_version, caps_lock_on, client_validation_passed, component, details.text, event_time, url, userAgent, viewport)

   2) The user interacted with the username input field by clicking it twice. (Log 7: app_version, caps_lock_on, client_validation_passed, component, details.text, details.trigger, event_time, password_length, perf, submit_trigger, system_noise, url, userAgent, viewport, username_length)

   3) The user interacted with the password input field. (Log 5: app_version, caps_lock_on, client_validation_passed, component, details.text, details.trigger, event_time, password_length, perf, submit_trigger, system_noise, url, userAgent, viewport)

   4) The user submitted the login form by clicking the submit button. (Log 3: app_version, caps_lock_on, client_validation_passed, component, details.text, details.trigger, event_time, password_length, perf, submit_trigger, system_noise, url, userAgent, viewport, username_length)

   In this log, it is important to consider all the interactions with the login form as they indicate the user's intention to complete the task. The user navigated to the login page, interacted with both input fields (username and password), and then submitted the form. Since all these steps were taken, the session can be classified as a conversion.
