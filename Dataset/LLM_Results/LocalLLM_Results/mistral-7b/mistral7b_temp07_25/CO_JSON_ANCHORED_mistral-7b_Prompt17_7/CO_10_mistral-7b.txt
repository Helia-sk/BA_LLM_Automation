==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off

   Reason: The user initiated tasks (clicking on "Balance", "Orders", and "View Details") but did not complete any of them, which indicates that they abandoned those tasks. Therefore, the session was a drop-off.

   1) [Step 1] The user started the session by clicking on the "Balance" link.
   2) [Step 2] The user then clicked on the "Orders" link, indicating a change in their intended action.
   3) [Step 3] The user clicked on the "View Details" link within the "Orders" section, suggesting an interest in viewing order details.
   4) [Step 4] The user clicked on the "Orders" link again, possibly to reconsider their previous action or navigate elsewhere.
   5) [Step 5] The user clicked on the "X" button (implied by clicking outside of an element) to close the page or navigate away, which is indicative of abandoning the session.
   I have considered all the logs in my decision making process. The user initiated tasks but did not complete any of them, indicating a drop-off.
