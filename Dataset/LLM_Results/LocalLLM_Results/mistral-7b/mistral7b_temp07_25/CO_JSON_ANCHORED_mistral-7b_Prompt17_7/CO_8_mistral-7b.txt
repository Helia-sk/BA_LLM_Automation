 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: One of the initiated tasks (typing in username) was abandoned, as indicated by the click event on the "Username" field followed by no further interaction with it.

   1) [Step 1] The user clicked on the "Customer Login" button on the homepage.
   2) [Step 2] The user navigated to the login page (indicated by the URL change).
   3) [Step 3] The user clicked on the "Username" field on the login page but did not provide any input or interact further with it, indicating that they abandoned the task of entering their username.
   Note: It is possible that the user intended to continue after these logs were captured, but based on the available information in this log file, we cannot definitively determine whether the task was completed or abandoned.
