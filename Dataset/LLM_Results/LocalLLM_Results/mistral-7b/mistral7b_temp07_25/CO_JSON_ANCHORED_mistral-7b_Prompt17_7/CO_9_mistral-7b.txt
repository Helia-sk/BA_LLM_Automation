 Tag: Conversion

   Reason: The user initiated a task (scrolling down the page and interacting with elements) and completed it by clicking on the "Restaurant" option. After that, the user scrolled down further on the same page and clicked on another element, indicating continued engagement. However, there is no logged event suggesting the completion of any other initiated tasks, such as making a reservation or placing an order.

   1) The user landed on the dashboard page (http://localhost:5173/customer/dashboard).
   2) The user scrolled down the page to view restaurant 4 and clicked on it.
   3) The user scrolled up the page after viewing restaurant 4.
   4) The user scrolled down again, this time interacting with an image (clicked on "No image available") which indicates that they were exploring more restaurants.
   5) The user scrolled further down the page, suggesting continued engagement and potential interest in more restaurants.
   Note: Although there is no logged event for a completed task beyond step 4, the user's actions indicate that they were actively engaged with the site, making it reasonable to classify this session as a conversion. However, if additional tasks had been initiated but abandoned, it would be considered a drop-off.
