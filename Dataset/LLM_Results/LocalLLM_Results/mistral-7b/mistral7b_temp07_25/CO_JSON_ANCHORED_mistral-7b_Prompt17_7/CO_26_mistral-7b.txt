 Tag: Drop-Off

   Reason: The user initiated a task (clicking on "Add Item") but did not complete it, indicating an incomplete action.

   3) [Step 3] The user navigated to the area where they could upload an image or click to select one (indicated by the text "Drag image here or click to upload").
   4) [Step 4] The user clicked on the section where images could be uploaded, but no subsequent logs show a successful image upload or any other actions related to adding an item.
   5) [Step 5] The user navigated away from the "Add Item" section by clicking on another area of the page (indicated by the click event at x:1504, y:229).
