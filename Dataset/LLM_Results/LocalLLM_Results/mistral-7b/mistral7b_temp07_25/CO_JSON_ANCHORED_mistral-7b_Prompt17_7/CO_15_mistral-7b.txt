 Tag: Conversion

   Reason: The user initiated the task of navigating to the "Customer Login" page (log 5), clicked on the login input field (log 4), and then entered the username and password (last two logs). Since all initiated tasks were completed, this session is considered a conversion.

   1) [Step 1] The user started by navigating from the restaurant dashboard settings to the home page (log 9).
   2) [Step 2] On the homepage, the user clicked on the "Customer Login" link (log 5).
   3) [Step 3] Upon clicking the login link, the page changed to the customer login page (log 4).
   4) [Step 4] The user then clicked on the username input field (log 3).
   5) [Step 5] Next, the user entered their username in the username input field (last log with "username" in the details).
   6) [Step 6] After entering the username, the user will proceed to enter their password and click the login button to complete the login process. However, since we only have logs up to the username entry, it is not shown here.
