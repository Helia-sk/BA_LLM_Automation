 Tag: Conversion

   Reason: The user initiated a task (clicking on the "Menu" button) and completed it (scrolling down the page). There is no evidence in the logs that any other tasks were started but not completed.

   1) [Step 1] User accessed the restaurant's dashboard at the URL "http://localhost:5173/restaurant/dashboard/menu" using Chrome version 1.4.2 on a Windows system.

   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "Menu" button located at position (571, 125). This action triggered a click event logged at "2025-09-27T15:03:48.126Z".

   3) [Step 3] After clicking on the "Menu" button, the user scrolled down the page, and this scroll event was logged at "2025-09-27T15:03:51.600Z".

   The logs do not provide any information about subsequent actions or interactions, so it is assumed that the user did not initiate any other tasks after scrolling down the page. Since all initiated tasks were completed, this session can be classified as a conversion.
