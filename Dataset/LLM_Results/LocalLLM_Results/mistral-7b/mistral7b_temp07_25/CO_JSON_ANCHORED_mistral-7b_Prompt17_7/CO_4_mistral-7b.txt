 Tag: Conversion

   Reason: All initiated tasks were completed. The user clicked on the "Restaurant Login" link, which led to the login page. Then, the user interacted with the username input field by clicking on it and did not submit any value. However, this does not count as an abandoned task because the next step was a click event on the "Sign up" link, indicating that the user intended to create a new account instead of logging in. After that, the user clicked on the "Already have an account? Sign in" button, which led back to the login page, and finally, the user entered a username (though it's not visible in the log) and clicked the submit button, presumably to log in or attempt to log in.

   1) The user navigated to the Restaurant Login page by clicking on the "Restaurant Login" link.
   2) The user interacted with the username input field by clicking on it but did not enter any value.
   3) The user clicked on the "Sign up" link, indicating an intention to create a new account.
   4) The user navigated back to the login page by clicking on the "Already have an account? Sign in" button.
   5) The user entered a username (though not visible in the log) and clicked the submit button, presumably to log in or attempt to log in.
