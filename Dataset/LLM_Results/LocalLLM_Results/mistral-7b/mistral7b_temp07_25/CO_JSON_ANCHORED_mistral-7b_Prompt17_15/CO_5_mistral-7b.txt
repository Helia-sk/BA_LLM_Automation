 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: One of the initiated tasks was abandoned, as the user clicked on the "Customer Login" button but did not complete any subsequent steps that would indicate a successful login and navigation to other pages.

   Steps:
   1) The user navigated to the home page of the website ("/") after which they scrolled through the content (Log 10).
   2) The user then scrolled down the page, indicating an interest in exploring more content (Log 9).
   3) The user clicked on the "Customer Login" button at the top right corner of the page (Log 5), which is one of the initiated tasks. However, this was not followed by any subsequent logs that would indicate a successful login and navigation to other pages, thus signifying an abandonment of this task.
   Check: All the logs have been considered for the decision making process.
