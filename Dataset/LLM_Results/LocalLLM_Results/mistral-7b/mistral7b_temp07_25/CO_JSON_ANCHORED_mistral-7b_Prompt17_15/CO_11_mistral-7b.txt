==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off

   Reason: The user did not complete the intended task (visiting the specific page "/customer/dashboard/[restaurant-id]/menu") which was initiated. Instead, they scrolled through the page and then navigated away from the application by visiting another URL (http://localhost:3000).

   1) [Step 1] The user started a new session on the customer dashboard at "2025-09-13T14:37:56.450Z".
   2) [Step 2] The user scrolled through the dashboard page to a certain extent, but did not visit any specific restaurant's menu page.
   3) [Step 3] The user then navigated away from the application by visiting another URL (http://localhost:3000). This indicates that the intended task of visiting a specific restaurant's menu was abandoned, leading to a drop-off.
   It is important to note that the user did not perform any further actions in the log file provided, so no additional steps can be inferred beyond this point. However, all the logs were considered for the decision making process.
