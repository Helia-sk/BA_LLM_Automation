==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user initiated a task (clicking on "Add Item") but did not complete it, indicating that they abandoned the process.

   1) [Step 1] User navigated to the restaurant dashboard menu page ("http://localhost:5173/restaurant/dashboard/menu").
   2) [Step 2] User clicked on "Add Item".
   3) [Step 3] User selected an item from the list of menu items (indicated by a click event). However, it's not clear if they actually completed the process of adding the item, as there's no subsequent log entry indicating this action.
   4) [Step 4] User navigated away from the "Add Item" section by clicking on another part of the menu page (indicated by a click event).
   It appears that the user initiated the task of adding an item but did not complete it, making this a drop-off session. The user journey ends with the user abandoning the process of adding an item to the menu. All logs were considered in this decision.
