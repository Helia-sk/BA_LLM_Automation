==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The session started with a click event on the "Menu" link, indicating the user navigated to the menu page. However, the subsequent events indicate scrolling and clicking on an SVG element without any corresponding navigation events, suggesting that the user may have interacted with some UI elements but did not complete any tasks that could be considered as conversion events (such as adding items to a cart or making a purchase). The session ended without any further interaction related to conversion events.

   User Journey:
   1) [Step 1] The user navigated to the restaurant dashboard page by clicking on the "Menu" link.
   2) [Step 2] The user scrolled down the menu page, indicating they were exploring the available options.
   3) [Step 3] The user clicked on an SVG element without any subsequent navigation or conversion events, suggesting they may have interacted with some UI elements for further exploration but did not complete any tasks that could be considered as conversion events (such as adding items to a cart or making a purchase).
   Since the user did not complete any tasks related to conversion events, this session can be classified as a drop-off. It is important to note that this decision is based on the available logs provided and additional context or logs might change this classification.
