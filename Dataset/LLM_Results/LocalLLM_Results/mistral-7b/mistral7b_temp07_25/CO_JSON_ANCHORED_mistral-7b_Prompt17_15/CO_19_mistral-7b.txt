 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user clicked on the "Customer Login" button, but did not complete any further tasks related to account creation or logging in. Instead, the session ended with a page view of the homepage (http://localhost:5173/). This indicates that the user initiated a task (logging in), but did not complete it, suggesting a drop-off.

   User Journey:
   1) [Step 1] The user navigated from the restaurant dashboard settings page to the customer login page (http://localhost:5173/customer/login).
   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "Customer Login" button.
   3) [Step 3] The user did not perform any further actions related to account creation or logging in. Instead, the session ended with a page view of the homepage (http://localhost:5173/). This suggests that the user did not complete the task they initiated, leading to a drop-off.
