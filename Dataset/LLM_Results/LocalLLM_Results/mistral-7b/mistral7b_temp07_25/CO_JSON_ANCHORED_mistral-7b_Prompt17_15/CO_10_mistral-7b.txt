==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: One of the initiated tasks (View Details in Orders section) was abandoned, as there is no log for the next action after that.
   1) [Step 1] The user started a new session by accessing the customer dashboard at `http://localhost:5173/customer`.
   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "Balance" link, navigating to the Balance page.
   3) [Step 3] The user clicked on the "Orders" link, navigating to the Orders page.
   4) [Step 4] The user clicked on the "View Details" button in the Orders page, but there is no subsequent log indicating further actions, suggesting that the user abandoned this task or left the site after this action.
   I have considered all the logs in my analysis and decision making.
