==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user initiated the task of viewing the details (as seen in log 4), but then they clicked on the "X" button (as seen in log 5) to close that same detail view, which indicates an abandonment of that task. However, since we have not observed a completion of all initiated tasks, we cannot definitively classify this session as a conversion.

   User Journey:
   1) [Step 1] The user visited the history page of the restaurant dashboard (as seen in log 9).
   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "History" link to navigate to the history page (as seen in log 10).
   3) [Step 3] The user clicked on a specific item's "View Details" button (as seen in log 4).
   4) [Step 4] The user then closed the detail view by clicking on the "X" button (as seen in log 5), indicating they did not complete the task of viewing that particular detail.
   Although we do not have enough information to confirm a conversion, it seems that this session represents a drop-off due to the user abandoning one of the initiated tasks.
