 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: One of the initiated tasks was abandoned. The user clicked on the "Restaurant PartnersRegister your restaurant or log in to manage orders" link, but did not complete either registration or login. Instead, they navigated to the login page and then interacted with the username and password fields without completing the form.

   User Journey:
   1) [Step 1] The user arrived at the Restaurant Partners landing page. They saw a link to "Register your restaurant or log in to manage orders".
   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the link to navigate to the login page.
   3) [Step 3] On the login page, the user interacted with the username field but did not enter any data.
   4) [Step 4] The user also interacted with the password field but did not enter any data.
   5) [Step 5] The user did not submit the form, and instead navigated away from the page or closed the browser.
   It is important to note that the user did initiate a task (logging in), but they did not complete it. Therefore, this session can be classified as a drop-off.
