 Tag: Drop-Off

   Reason: The user initiated a task by clicking on "History", but subsequently abandoned that task by clicking "Reject". No other tasks were completed.

   1) [Step 1] The user navigated to the restaurant dashboard page (/restaurant/dashboard).
   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "History" link, initiating a new task.
   3) [Step 3] The user then clicked on "Reject", indicating that they abandoned this task and did not proceed to view the history details.
   4) [Step 4] The user clicked on "Reject" again, which was likely related to the history action, as no other actions were recorded after this point.
   I have considered all the logs provided in the log file for my decision making.
