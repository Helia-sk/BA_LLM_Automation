 Tag: Drop-Off

   Reason: One of the initiated tasks was abandoned, which indicates a drop-off session. The user navigated from the dashboard to Restaurants (Step 1) and then to a specific restaurant page (Step 2). However, after clicking on the image within the restaurant details (Step 3), there is no further interaction indicating that the user did not complete the task of scrolling down or interacting with any other elements on the page.

   1) The user navigated from the dashboard to the Restaurants section (Step 1).
   2) The user clicked on a specific restaurant link within the Restaurants section (Step 2).
   3) The user clicked on the image within the restaurant details (Step 3), but there was no further interaction or completion of any other tasks.

   It is important to note that while the user did not complete all initiated tasks, it does not necessarily mean they left the site immediately. They could have browsed other parts of the site or taken some time before making a decision. However, based on the provided logs, we can only classify this session as a drop-off since one of the initiated tasks was abandoned.
