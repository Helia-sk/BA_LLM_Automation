 Tag: Drop-Off

   Reason: The user has initiated multiple tasks, such as scrolling and clicking on various elements, but one of these tasks was not completed. Specifically, after scrolling to the bottom of the page (Step 1), the user clicked on the "Restaurant 4" link (Step 2) and then scrolled down some more (Step 3). However, the user did not complete any further actions related to Restaurant 4, such as clicking on the image or navigating away from the page. As one of the initiated tasks was abandoned, we classify this session as a drop-off.

   1) [Step 1] The user visited the customer dashboard page.
   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "Restaurant 4" link from the list of restaurants.
   3) [Step 3] The user scrolled down the Restaurant 4 page, but did not complete any further actions related to it (e.g., click on the image or navigate away from the page). This indicates that the user abandoned the task initiated with the "Restaurant 4" link, leading to a drop-off session.

   It is important to note that we have considered all the logs provided in our analysis. We did not make any assumptions or guesses about the user's actions outside of the given data.
