 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user initiated tasks, but one of those tasks was abandoned. In this case, the user clicked on "Menu", then clicked on an SVG element, and finally interacted with a form. However, the user did not complete the interaction with the form (submitting or cancelling), which indicates that they left the page without finishing the intended task.

   Step 1: The user navigated to the restaurant dashboard page ("/restaurant/dashboard/menu").
   Step 2: The user clicked on the "Menu" link located at x = 586, y = 124.
   Step 3: The user interacted with an SVG element located at x = 664, y = 338.
   Step 4: The user initiated an interaction with a form, but did not complete the action (submit or cancel), suggesting that they dropped off from the page.
