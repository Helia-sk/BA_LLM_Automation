==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The session initiated an "http_request" to accept an order (indicating a task was started), but it did not receive a corresponding "http_response" for that request, suggesting that the task was not completed. This is consistent with the definition of a drop-off, where at least one initiated task is abandoned.

  1) [Step 1] User initiated an HTTP request (log id: 04cc6eb7-92ae-42c6-b7cb-3f775a0b688a) to accept an order on the backend system, using Chrome browser.
  2) [Step 2] The same user received an HTTP response (log id: eed6c637-536a-43da-8a27-e93d3347b1d7), indicating that the order was accepted successfully, with a status code of 200.
  3) [Step 3] The user then made an OPTIONS request (logs id: cd4df248-d36e-480c-b94a-21ecc1826e64 and d574513a-4ec9-43d8-9580-9e8634754b75), likely due to a preflight request for CORS, but no corresponding response was logged.
  4) [Step 4] On the frontend side, an anonymous user (log id: log_1758985714781_pjjhy0zwj) clicked a "Accept" button on the dashboard, indicating they were attempting to accept another order. However, no corresponding backend request was logged for this action, suggesting that the action was not completed (drop-off).
  5) [Step 5] The same anonymous user made a click event (log id: log_1758985707836_95fu2oszs) on an SVG element, but no further actions were logged for this session.
