==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user initiated tasks such as clicking on the "Customer Login" link, which indicates they began a login process. However, the logs show that the user never entered any information into the username and password fields, and did not complete the login process by clicking the submit button. This suggests that the user abandoned the process before completing all the initiated tasks.

   User Journey:
   1) [Step 1] The user visited the homepage of the website.
   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "Customer Login" link, indicating they wanted to start the login process.
   3) [Step 3] The user did not enter any information into the username field.
   4) [Step 4] The user did not enter any information into the password field.
   5) [Step 5] The user did not click on the submit button to complete the login process, indicating they abandoned the process.

   All logs have been considered in this analysis. The user did not complete all the initiated tasks, so the session was a drop-off.
