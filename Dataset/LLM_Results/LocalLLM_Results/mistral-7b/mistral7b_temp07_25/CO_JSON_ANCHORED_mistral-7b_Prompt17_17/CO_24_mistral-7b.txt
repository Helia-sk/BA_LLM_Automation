 Tag: Drop-Off

   Reason: The session was not a conversion because one of the initiated tasks, specifically the uploading of an image for a menu item, was abandoned. The user navigated to the "ImageDrag image here or click to upload" section but did not interact further with it, indicating that they did not complete the task.

   1) [Step 1] The user accessed the restaurant dashboard at http://localhost:5173/restaurant/dashboard/menu.

   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "Menu" link located at x=586, y=124.

   3) [Step 3] The user navigated to the form section of the menu dashboard.

   4) [Step 4] The user interacted with the form by clicking on it (log id: log_1758985331764_8nlogiyec), but did not proceed to upload an image or fill out any other fields.

   5) [Step 5] The user clicked on an SVG element located at x=664, y=338 (log id: log_1758985330432_e2cyil3bd), but further interaction data was not provided.

   6) [Step 6] The user clicked on an input field or a button within the form, indicating that they may have attempted to upload an image or fill out other fields, but they abandoned this task (log id: log_1758985330432_oymp343kw).

   7) [Step 7] The user interacted with various elements within the form, suggesting that they were still active and exploring the dashboard, but no further interactions related to completing a menu item were recorded.

   As all initiated tasks were not completed, the session was classified as a drop-off. It is important to note that the log data provided does not show the user's final interaction, so it is possible that they could have left the site or continued interacting without further logging events being captured.
