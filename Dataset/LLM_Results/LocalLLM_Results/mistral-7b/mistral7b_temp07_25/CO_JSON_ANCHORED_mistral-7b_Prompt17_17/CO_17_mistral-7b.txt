 Tag: Conversion

   Reason: All initiated tasks were completed in this session. The user started by clicking on "Restaurants" from the dashboard (Step 1), then clicked on a specific restaurant (Step 2), and finally interacted with the "No image available" div (Step 3). After that, the user performed an action that led to the addition of the restaurant to their list, as indicated by the button labeled "Added to my list" (Step 4). Lastly, the user clicked on the "My List" link from the dashboard to view their list (Step 5), indicating a completed session.

   1) The user started the session by clicking on "Restaurants" from the dashboard.
   2) The user clicked on a specific restaurant, presumably to view more details about it.
   3) The user interacted with the "No image available" div, which might have been an image placeholder or a clickable element.
   4) The user performed an action that led to the addition of the restaurant to their list, as indicated by the button labeled "Added to my list".
   5) The user clicked on the "My List" link from the dashboard to view their list and concluded the session.

   In this log, all initiated tasks were completed, so the session was a conversion. The user's journey started with viewing the restaurants, selected a specific restaurant, interacted with its details, added it to their list, and finally viewed their list of restaurants.
