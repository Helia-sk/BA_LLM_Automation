==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off

   Reason: The user initiated the task of clicking on the "Customer Login" button, but did not complete the subsequent tasks such as entering a username and password. Instead, they clicked on other elements (the username input field and the Customer Login button) repeatedly without providing any data or proceeding with the login process. This indicates that the session was dropped off before completion.

   1) [Step 1] The user opened the webpage at "http://localhost:5173/customer/login".
   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "Customer Login" button, which led to no response as they did not provide any username or password.
   3) [Step 3] The user clicked repeatedly on the username input field and the Customer Login button without providing any data or proceeding with the login process, indicating that they dropped off before completing the task.
   It's important to note that the logs do not show any subsequent actions such as navigation away from the page or interaction with other elements that would indicate a successful login or conversion. Therefore, based on the available information, this session can be classified as a drop-off.
