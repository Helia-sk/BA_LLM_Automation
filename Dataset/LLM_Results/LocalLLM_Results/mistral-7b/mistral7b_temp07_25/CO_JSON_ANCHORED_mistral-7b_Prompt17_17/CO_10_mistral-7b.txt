==================================================

 Tag: Conversion
   Reason: All initiated tasks in the session have been completed. The user first clicked on "Balance", then on "Orders", and finally navigated to "Orders" again, indicating that they viewed their orders details. After viewing order details, they clicked on "View Details" for one of the orders, and subsequently clicked on "Orders" again. Lastly, they clicked on "Orders" one more time before closing the session by clicking "X".

1) The user initiated a session by clicking on the "Balance" link (Tag: Initiated Task).
2) The user then clicked on the "Orders" link (Tag: Initiated Task).
3) The user navigated to the "Orders" page and clicked on one of the orders, initiating a task to view order details (Tag: Initiated Task).
4) The user clicked on "View Details" for the selected order, completing the task of viewing order details (Tag: Completed Task).
5) The user clicked on "Orders" again, navigating back to the orders page (Tag: Initiated Task).
6) The user clicked on "Orders" one more time before closing the session by clicking "X". This action could be considered as a drop-off or navigation away from the site, but since all other tasks were completed, it does not affect the overall classification of the session (Tag: Initiated Task).

Considered all logs to the end.
