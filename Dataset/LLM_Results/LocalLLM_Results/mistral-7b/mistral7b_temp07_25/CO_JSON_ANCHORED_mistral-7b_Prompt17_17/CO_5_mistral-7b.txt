==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user initiated the task of clicking on the "Customer Login" button, but did not complete the subsequent steps such as entering a username and password. The scroll events indicate that the user was exploring the page before clicking the login button, but this action alone does not constitute a conversion.

  1) [Step 1] The user accessed the homepage of the website ("/").
  2) [Step 2] The user scrolled through the homepage to find the "Customer Login" button located at the top right corner.
  3) [Step 3] The user clicked on the "Customer Login" button, initiating the login process.
  4) [Step 4] Instead of proceeding with the login steps (entering a username and password), the user stopped interacting with the page, indicating a drop-off.
  5) [Step 5] The user scrolled through the homepage again, possibly looking for more information or other options, but did not initiate any further tasks during the session.

All initiated tasks were not completed, hence the classification as a drop-off. It's important to note that the user journey does not necessarily end here, as the user could return and complete the login process in a future session.
