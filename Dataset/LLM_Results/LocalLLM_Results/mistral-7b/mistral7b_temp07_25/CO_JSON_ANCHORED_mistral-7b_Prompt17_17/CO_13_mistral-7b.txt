==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: Although the user initiated a task by clicking on "History", they did not complete any other tasks that were initiated such as "View Details". The user also interacted with elements that typically indicate closing or leaving the page, like the "X" button.

  1) [Step 1] The user navigated to the 'restaurant/dashboard/history' page (log_1757835951066).
  2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "History" link to navigate to the history section of the dashboard (log_1757835951066).
  3) [Step 3] The user didn't perform any further interactions that could be considered as completing a task, like clicking on "View Details".
  4) [Step 4] The user clicked on the "X" button (log_1757835963781), which is typically used for closing or leaving a page.
  5) [Step 5] The user didn't perform any other interactions after clicking the "X" button, indicating they may have left the page without completing any tasks (logs from that point onward do not show any further interactions).

Considering all the logs provided, it appears that the user didn't complete any tasks beyond the initial click on the "History" link, and they interacted with elements that typically indicate closing or leaving the page. Therefore, this session can be classified as a drop-off.
