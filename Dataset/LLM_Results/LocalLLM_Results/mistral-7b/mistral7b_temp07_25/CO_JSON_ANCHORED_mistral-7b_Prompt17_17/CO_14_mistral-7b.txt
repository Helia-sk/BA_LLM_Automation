==================================================

 Tag: Conversion

   Reason: The user initiated two tasks (clicking the "Customer Login" button and filling in the username field), and completed both of them, which indicates a successful login. No further tasks were initiated, suggesting that the session was not abandoned.

   1) The user visited the homepage (http://localhost:5173/).
   2) The user clicked on the "Customer Login" button located at x=1647, y=35.
   3) The user navigated to the login page (http://localhost:5173/customer/login).
   4) The user clicked on the username input field (x=997, y=292).
   5) The user typed in their username ("User1") into the username field.
   6) The user did not initiate any other tasks, suggesting a successful login and a completed session.

   All initiated tasks were completed, hence the tag is "Conversion". The user journey can be seen as a successful login process.
