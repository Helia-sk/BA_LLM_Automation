==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off

   Reason: The user did not complete the intended task (making a purchase, filling out a form, etc.), as evidenced by the fact that they navigated to a specific restaurant page but did not perform any actions that indicate a conversion. Additionally, the user scrolled through the page multiple times, but there are no logs indicating that they interacted with any elements on the page that would typically signify engagement (clicking buttons, filling out forms, etc.).

   1) [Step 1] The user visits the main dashboard of the application.

   2) [Step 2] The user navigates to a specific restaurant page (restaurant/4).

   3) [Step 3] The user scrolls through the restaurant's information but does not interact with any elements on the page, such as images or buttons.

   4) [Step 4] The user clicks on an image, presumably expecting to see more details about the restaurant, but there is no corresponding log entry indicating that they actually viewed additional information.

   5) [Step 5] The user continues scrolling through the restaurant's page multiple times without engaging with any elements or performing actions that would indicate a conversion.

   I have reviewed all the logs and considered every initiated task in the decision-making process. Based on the lack of completed tasks, I have classified this session as a drop-off.
