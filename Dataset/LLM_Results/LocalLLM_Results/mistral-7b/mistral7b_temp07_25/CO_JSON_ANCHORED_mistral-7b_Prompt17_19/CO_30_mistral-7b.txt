==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off

   Reason: Although the user initiated several tasks such as clicking on links to navigate through the application, they did not complete one of the initiated tasks (View Details). This indicates that the session was dropped off without completing all the intended actions.

   1) [Step 1] The user navigated to the restaurant dashboard page (/restaurant/dashboard) from an unknown source or directly typed in the URL.

   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "History" link to navigate to the history section of the dashboard.

   3) [Step 3] The user viewed a list of orders in the history section, but instead of clicking on any specific order's View Details button, they clicked on the "Reject" button for an order.

   4) [Step 4] The user then went back to the dashboard by clicking on the "Back" button or link and hovered over an order but didn't click on it, indicating that they might have intended to view its details. However, they clicked the "Reject" button again for a different order.

   5) [Step 5] The user then navigated to the history section once more by clicking on the "History" link, but instead of viewing any specific order's details, they clicked on the "Reject" button for yet another order.

   6) [Step 6] The user then clicked on the "X" button or link to close the application or navigate away from it. This marked the end of the session as a drop-off since one of the initiated tasks (Viewing details of an order) was abandoned.
