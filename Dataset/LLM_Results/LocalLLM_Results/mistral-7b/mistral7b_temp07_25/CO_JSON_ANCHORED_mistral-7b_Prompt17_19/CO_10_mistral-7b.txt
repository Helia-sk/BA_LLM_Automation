 Tag: Drop-Off

   Reason: One of the initiated tasks was abandoned. The user clicked on "Orders" but did not proceed to complete any other tasks related to viewing or interacting with orders, such as clicking on a specific order to view details or making a purchase.

   1) [Step 1] The user accessed the customer dashboard (URL: localhost:5173/customer).
   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on "Balance" but did not proceed with any balance-related tasks.
   3) [Step 3] The user clicked on "Orders", indicating an interest in viewing their orders, but did not click on a specific order to view details or make a purchase.
   4) [Step 4] The user clicked on "View Details" for the "Balance" section but did not complete any tasks related to the balance.
   5) [Step 5] The user closed the session without completing any other tasks.

   All initiated tasks were not completed, so the session was classified as a drop-off. It is important to note that all logs in this particular case were considered before making a decision.
