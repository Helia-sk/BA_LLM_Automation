 Tag: Conversion
   Reason: All initiated tasks in this session were completed. The user first clicked on the "Settings" link, then clicked and focused on an input field, clicked again on another input field, clicked on a button labeled "Add", filled out a form (implied by focusing on an input field), and finally submitted the form by clicking on the "Submit" button.

  1) The user clicked on the "Settings" link in the navigation menu.
  2) The user clicked on an empty input field, presumably to enter some data.
  3) The user clicked again on another input field, indicating they were entering additional data.
  4) The user clicked on a button labeled "Add", possibly to submit the form containing the entered data.
  5) The user filled out the form by focusing on an input field (implied), likely finishing the entry of their data.
  6) The user submitted the form by clicking on the "Submit" button, completing the task they initiated.

All the logs were considered to reach this conclusion.
