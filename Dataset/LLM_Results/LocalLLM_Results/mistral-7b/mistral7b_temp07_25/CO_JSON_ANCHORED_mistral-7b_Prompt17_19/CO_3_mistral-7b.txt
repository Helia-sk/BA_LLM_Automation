==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The session started with a click on the "Restaurant Login" link, indicating an initiated task. However, after that, no further actions related to entering username or password were observed in the logs. This implies that the user did not proceed with the login process, which is a necessary step for a conversion. Therefore, this session can be classified as a drop-off.

   User Journey:
   1) [Step 1] A user clicked on the "Restaurant Login" link, indicating an intention to log in.
   2) [No Step 2] No further actions related to entering username or password were observed in the logs, suggesting that the user did not proceed with the login process.
   [Note: Additional initiated tasks such as clicking on the username and password input fields were not observed, which would be expected if the user was attempting to log in.]
   3) [No Step 3] No further actions related to interacting with the webpage or performing any other tasks were observed in the logs, indicating that the user abandoned the session.
