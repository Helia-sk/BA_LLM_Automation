 Tag: Conversion

   Reason: All initiated tasks in the session were completed. The user clicked on the link to go to the login page, entered their username and password, and submitted the form. This indicates that they have successfully logged in, which is considered a conversion as it means they have completed the intended action on the website.

   1) [Step 1] The user arrived at the website's homepage. They saw a call-to-action (CTA) for ordering food and clicked on it.

   2) [Step 2] The user was redirected to the login page.

   3) [Step 3] The user entered their username in the username field and clicked on the username field to focus it.

   4) [Step 4] The user entered their password in the password field and clicked on the password field to focus it.

   5) [Step 5] The user submitted the login form by clicking the submit button, indicating that they have successfully logged in.

   In this case, all initiated tasks were completed, so the session was a conversion. It's important to note that I considered all the logs in my decision making.
