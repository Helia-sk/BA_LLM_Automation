 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user started by navigating to the "/restaurant/login" page (Step 1), then clicked a link to navigate to "/restaurant/dashboard" (Step 2). However, the user did not complete any further tasks that could be considered initiated. Instead, the user navigated back to the homepage ("/") (Step 3), which indicates abandonment of the intended task (logging in or managing orders). The subsequent actions do not involve any completed tasks related to the initial intent.

   2) [Step 2] Clicked a link to navigate to "/restaurant/dashboard".
