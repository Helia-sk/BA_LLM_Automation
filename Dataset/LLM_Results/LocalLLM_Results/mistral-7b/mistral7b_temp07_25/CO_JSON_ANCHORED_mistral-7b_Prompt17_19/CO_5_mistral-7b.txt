==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off

   Reason: The user initiated a task (clicking on "Customer Login") but did not complete it, which indicates that they dropped off. However, since we have not seen any logs indicating completion of other tasks, we cannot confirm that all tasks were completed.

   1) [Step 1] The user accessed the homepage ("http://localhost:5173/").
   2) [Step 2] The user scrolled down the page to reach the "Customer Login" button.
   3) [Step 3] The user clicked on the "Customer Login" button, initiating a task but did not complete it (drop-off).
   We have not seen any further logs that indicate completion of other tasks, so we cannot confirm if all initiated tasks were completed or not. It's important to note that this analysis is based on the given log data and does not consider any external factors such as server errors or network issues that may have occurred during the session.
