 Tag: Conversion
   Reason: All initiated tasks in the session were completed. The user initially landed on the dashboard ("/customer/dashboard"), clicked on "Restaurants", scrolled down to view a restaurant page, clicked on the image of a restaurant ("No image available"), and then clicked the button to add it to their cart ("Added to Cart"). Finally, the user proceeded to the checkout page and completed the purchase ("Purchase Completed").

  1) The user landed on the dashboard ("/customer/dashboard")
  2) The user clicked on "Restaurants" from the dashboard.
  3) The user scrolled down to view a restaurant page.
  4) The user clicked on the image of a restaurant ("No image available").
  5) The user clicked the button to add it to their cart ("Added to Cart").
  6) The user proceeded to the checkout page and completed the purchase ("Purchase Completed").

   All initiated tasks were completed, so the session was a conversion. I have considered all the logs provided in the file.
