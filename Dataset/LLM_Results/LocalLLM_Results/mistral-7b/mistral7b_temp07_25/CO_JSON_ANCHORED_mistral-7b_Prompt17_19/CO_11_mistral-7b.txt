==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: One of the initiated tasks (scrolling on the dashboard page) was abandoned as the user did not proceed to any other pages or complete any tasks. The user scrolled up and down on the dashboard but did not click on any links or buttons that could lead to a conversion event such as visiting the restaurant details page, ordering food, or logging in/signing up.

   User Journey:
   1) [Step 1] The user accessed the dashboard page (/customer/dashboard).
   2) [Step 2] The user scrolled up and down on the dashboard page multiple times, indicating exploration of the available options.
   3) [Step 3] No further actions were taken by the user, and they did not visit any other pages or initiate any tasks that could lead to a conversion event.
   It should be noted that this analysis is based on the provided log file and does not account for potential external factors such as browser crashes, network issues, or user distractions. However, all initiated tasks (scrolling) were observed within the log file, and no completed tasks or conversions were found.
