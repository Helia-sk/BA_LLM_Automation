 Tag: Drop-Off

   Reason: The user clicked on the "Customer Login" link, but did not proceed to complete the login form by entering their username or password. This indicates that the user abandoned the task of logging in.

   1) [Step 1] The user visited the homepage and clicked on the "Customer Login" link located at x = 633, y = 35.
   2) [Step 2] Upon clicking the "Customer Login" link, the page navigated to the customer login form. However, the user did not click or interact with any element within the form such as the username or password input fields.
   3) [Step 3] The user also did not click on the submit button to complete the login process. Instead, they exited the application without further interaction, indicating that the task of logging in was abandoned.

   It is important to note that although the user initially clicked on the "Customer Login" link, their subsequent actions do not indicate a successful completion of the login process or any other initiated tasks within the session. Therefore, this session should be classified as a drop-off.
