 Tag: Conversion

   Reason: The user completed all initiated tasks in the session. After clicking on the "Customer Login" link, the user navigated to the login page and clicked on the input field for username. Then, the user typed something (indicated by a blank text field) and moved the cursor away from the field, which suggests that the user filled out the username field. Following this, the user clicked on the "Already have an account? Sign in" link, indicating that they already had an account and were attempting to sign in instead of creating a new one. After clicking the "Sign in" button, there are no more logs suggesting further actions or tasks abandoned during the session, which means all initiated tasks were completed.
