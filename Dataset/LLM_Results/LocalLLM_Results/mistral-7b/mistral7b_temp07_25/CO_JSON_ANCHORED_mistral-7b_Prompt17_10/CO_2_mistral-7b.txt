 Tag: Conversion

   Reason: The user journey shows that the user clicked on the "Customer Login" link, then navigated to the login page and clicked on the username input field, indicating an intent to enter their credentials. After this, the user clicked the "Already have an account? Sign in" button, which typically means a user intends to sign in instead of creating an account. The user then interacted with the username input field again (possibly typing their username), and finally submitted the form by clicking the submit button. This indicates that the user completed all the initiated tasks related to signing in, thus classifying this session as a conversion.
