==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: One of the initiated tasks (accepting an order in the backend logs) was abandoned. The frontend logs show a click event on a button labeled "Accept", but there is no corresponding HTTP request or response event in the backend logs for the same timeframe, indicating that the action was not completed.

   User Journey:
   1) [Step 1] The user initiated a session at the restaurant dashboard (frontend log).
   2) [Step 2] The user navigated to the orders page, likely to accept an order (implied by the route in the backend log). However, this action was not completed as there is no corresponding HTTP response event for the POST request to /api/orders/26/accept.
   3) [Step 3] The user clicked on a button labeled "Accept" at the orders page (frontend log), but again, this action was not completed as there is still no corresponding HTTP response event in the backend logs for the same timeframe.
   I have considered all the logs provided and made my decision based on the evidence presented.
