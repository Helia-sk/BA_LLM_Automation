==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: While the user initiated a login process, they did not complete the form submission. One of the tasks (form submission) was abandoned, which indicates a drop-off.

   1) [Step 1] The user visited the restaurant's website (route: "/restaurant/login").
   2) [Step 2] The user filled out the login form (event: "input_change" for username and password).
   3) [Step 3] The user clicked the 'Sign In' button to submit the form (event: "click"), but did not complete the submission (event: "form_submit").
   4) [Step 4] The user blurred out from the password input field (event: "blur") without re-submitting the form, indicating an abandonment of the task.
   Note: All logs were considered in this analysis. The user did not complete all initiated tasks, hence the session was classified as a drop-off.
