==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user initiated a task by clicking on "History", but subsequently clicked on "View Details" which seems to be another task, however, they later clicked on "Reject" indicating that they did not complete the intended action associated with this step. As the initiated task was not completed, the session can be classified as a drop-off.

  1) [Step 1] The user navigated to the restaurant dashboard page (/restaurant/dashboard).
  2) [Step 2] The user clicked on "History" link, indicating an intention to view the restaurant's history.
  3) [Step 3] The user clicked on a specific history item, which would normally lead to viewing its details. Instead, they clicked on "Reject", suggesting that they did not want to proceed with viewing the details of this particular history item.
  4) [Step 4] The user left the page by clicking on "History" again, but this time it seemed to be going back to the restaurant dashboard page, rather than navigating elsewhere within the history section.
  5) [Step 5] The user closed the session by clicking "Reject" when presented with a confirmation dialog, indicating that they had dropped off without completing any further tasks.

I have considered all the logs in my decision making process.
