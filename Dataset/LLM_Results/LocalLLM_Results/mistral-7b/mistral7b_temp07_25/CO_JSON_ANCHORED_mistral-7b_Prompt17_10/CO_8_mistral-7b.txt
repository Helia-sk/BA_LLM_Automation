==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: Although the user clicked on the "Customer Login" link, they did not proceed to fill out the username or password fields. This indicates that they may have abandoned the session before completing the intended task of logging in.

   Step 1) The user accessed the website homepage.
   Step 2) The user clicked on the "Customer Login" link located at the top right corner of the page.
   Step 3) The user did not interact with any elements related to the login form, such as username or password fields.
   Step 4) The session ended without any further interaction from the user.

To ensure that all logs have been considered: The user accessed the website homepage, clicked on the "Customer Login" link, but did not proceed to fill out the login form or take any other action before ending the session. Since one of the initiated tasks was abandoned (logging in), the session can be classified as a drop-off.
