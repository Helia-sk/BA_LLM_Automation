==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: One of the initiated tasks (View Details) was abandoned, indicating that the user did not complete all tasks.

   1) [Step 1] The user visited the restaurant dashboard page at "http://localhost:5173/restaurant/dashboard/history" (log_1757835961979_hw4mtgead).
   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "History" link to navigate to the history page at "http://localhost:5173/restaurant/dashboard/history" (log_1757835951066_9edj3bwaz).
   3) [Step 3] The user clicked on the "View Details" button to view details of a specific item, but then decided to abandon this action by clicking the "X" button (log_1757835963781_2e9f53t2n).
   4) [Step 4] The user clicked on the "X" button again to close a different element on the page, indicating that the user did not interact with any other elements on the page (log_1757835961979_hw4mtgead).
   5) [Step 5] The user clicked on the "X" button a third time to close yet another element on the page, again indicating that the user did not interact with any other elements on the page (log_1757835961979_hw4mtgead).
   6) [Step 6] The user left the page without completing any tasks.

It's important to note that I considered all the logs in my decision making. The user did not complete all initiated tasks, which meets one of the conditions for a "Drop-Off". The user also didn't interact with any other elements on the page after clicking the "View Details" button, which may suggest that they were already intending to leave the site.
