   Reason: The user initiated the task of navigating to the customer login page and then proceeded to enter their username ("User1") in the provided input field, indicating that they are attempting to log in. After entering their username, they clicked on the "Customer Login" button, which is the expected action to submit a login request. No subsequent logs indicate any further actions or issues that would suggest the session was abandoned.

   1) User navigated to the customer login page (log: "Customer Login" click event).
   2) User entered their username ("User1") in the provided input field (logs with "debounced_input" and "click" events for the username input).
   3) User clicked on the "Customer Login" button to submit their login request (log: "Customer Login" click event after entering username).
   The user journey ended here, as no subsequent logs suggest any further actions or issues. It appears that the session was completed without any drop-offs.
