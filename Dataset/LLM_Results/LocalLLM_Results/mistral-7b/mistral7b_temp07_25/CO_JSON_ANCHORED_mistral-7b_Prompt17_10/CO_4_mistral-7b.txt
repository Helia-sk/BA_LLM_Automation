==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off

   Reason: The user initiated a task (clicking on the "Restaurant Login" link) but did not complete it by entering any information into the username field, which indicates that the user left the page without completing the login process. This is further supported by the fact that no subsequent logs indicate completion of the login form or any other actions that would indicate a successful login.

   1) [Step 1] The user accessed the restaurant's login page ("/restaurant/login") through a link on the main page.
   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "Restaurant Login" link, which triggered a click event.
   3) [Step 3] No further actions were taken by the user that would indicate an attempt to log in or any other action on the login page.
   4) [Step 4] The user left the page without performing any other tasks.

   Note: All logs provided were considered in reaching this decision, as all events related to the login process were tracked and no subsequent actions were taken that would indicate a successful login or completion of other tasks on the page.
