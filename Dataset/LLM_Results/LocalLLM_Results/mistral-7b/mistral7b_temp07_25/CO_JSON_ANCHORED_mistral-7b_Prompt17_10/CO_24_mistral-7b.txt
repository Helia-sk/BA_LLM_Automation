==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off

   Reason: Not all initiated tasks were completed. The user initiated a click on the "Menu" link, but did not complete any of the subsequent actions related to uploading or modifying menu items.

   1) [Step 1] The user opened the restaurant dashboard page at http://localhost:5173/restaurant/dashboard/.

   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "Menu" link located at x = 586, y = 124.

   3) [Step 3] The user hovered over the form area for menu items but did not interact with any of the input fields or the "Save Changes" or "Cancel" buttons.

   4) [Step 4] The user clicked on an SVG element at x = 664, y = 338, but the log does not provide information about what this action might have done.

   5) [Step 5] The user clicked on a form area with class name "space-y-4" at x = 889, y = 695, possibly intending to interact with the menu item form. However, no further interaction with the form was recorded.

   6) [Step 6] The user clicked on an input field for a menu item but did not enter any data or submit the form.

   7) [Step 7] The user clicked on another input field for a different menu item and again did not enter any data or submit the form.

   8) [Step 8] The user clicked on an image drag area but did not interact with it further, possibly intending to upload an image for a menu item.

   9) [Step 9] The user clicked on the "ImageDrag" svg at x = 664, y = 338, but no further information about this action is provided in the log.

   After reviewing all the logs, it appears that the user initiated actions related to managing menu items but did not complete any of them. Therefore, the session can be classified as a drop-off.
