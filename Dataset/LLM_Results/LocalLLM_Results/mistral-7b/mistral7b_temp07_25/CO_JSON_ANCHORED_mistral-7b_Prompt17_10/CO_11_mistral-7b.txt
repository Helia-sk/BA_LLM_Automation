 Tag: Drop-Off

   Reason: Although the user initially navigated to the "customer/dashboard", there are no subsequent logs indicating completion of any tasks initiated from that page. The user did scroll down the page, but none of the initiated tasks were completed (e.g., clicking a button, filling a form, etc.). This suggests that the session was abandoned or incomplete.

   1) [Step 1] User opened the application on a Windows device using Chrome browser (as indicated by userAgent).
   2) [Step 2] User navigated to the customer dashboard page ("/customer/dashboard").
   3) [Step 3] User scrolled down the page, suggesting they were exploring the content. However, there is no indication of any further interaction or completion of tasks from this point onwards.
   4) [Step 4] The session ended without any further activity, indicating a drop-off.
