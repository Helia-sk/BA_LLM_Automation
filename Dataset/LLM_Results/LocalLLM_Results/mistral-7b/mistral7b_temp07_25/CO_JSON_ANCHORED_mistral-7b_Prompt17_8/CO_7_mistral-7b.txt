==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off

   Reason: The user initiated a task (clicking on the "Customer Login" link) but did not complete the subsequent tasks (entering username and password, clicking submit). Instead, the user left the page by clicking elsewhere. This indicates that the session was a drop-off because not all initiated tasks were completed.

   1) [Step 1] The user visited the homepage (http://localhost:5173/).
   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "Customer Login" link located at x = 633, y = 35.
   3) [Step 3] The user navigated to the customer login form (http://localhost:5173/customer/login).
   4) [Step 4] The user clicked on the username input field (x = 451, y = 310).
   5) [Step 5] The user clicked outside of the form (x = 433, y = 320), which suggests that they might have intended to enter their username but did not.
   6) [Step 6] The user clicked on the username input field again (x = 451, y = 310), possibly trying to correct a mistake or focus on the field.
   7) The user did not perform any further actions related to the login process, indicating that they left the page without completing the task. This is evidenced by the final log where the user clicked elsewhere (x = 633, y = 35), which suggests that they navigated away from the page.

   I have considered all the logs in this analysis.
