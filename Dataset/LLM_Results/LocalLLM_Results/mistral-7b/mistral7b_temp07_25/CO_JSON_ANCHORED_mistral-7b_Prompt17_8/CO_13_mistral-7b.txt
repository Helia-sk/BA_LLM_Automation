 Tag: Drop-Off

   Reason: The user initiated a task (clicked on "History") but did not complete it by clicking on any of the subsequent options such as "View Details" or navigating away from the History section. Instead, the user clicked on the 'X' button which is typically used for closing or canceling actions, indicating that the user may have decided to abandon the task.

   1) The user opened the application (not logged in as there's no user information provided).

   2) The user navigated to the dashboard of a restaurant.

   3) The user clicked on the "History" option, but did not proceed to any specific history item or click on "View Details".

   4) The user clicked on the 'X' button, which suggests that the user decided to leave or abandon the task without completing it.

   I have considered all the logs provided in this analysis as they cover the entire user interaction sequence from opening the app to clicking on the 'X' button.
