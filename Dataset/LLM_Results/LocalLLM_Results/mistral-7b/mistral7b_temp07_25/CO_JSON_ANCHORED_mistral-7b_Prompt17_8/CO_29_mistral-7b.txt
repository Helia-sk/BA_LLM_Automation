 Tag: Conversion

   Reason: All initiated tasks in this session were completed. The user clicked on "History", then "View Details", and finally "X" to close the details panel, which is a part of the expected flow for navigating through the history section. After that, the user navigated to the "Balance" tab and initiated a transaction by clicking on "Add Funds". This action was followed by another click on "Pay with Card", indicating the user intended to make a payment. Lastly, the user clicked on "Back" to return to the dashboard, which is expected after completing a transaction.

   1) The user initially navigated to the "History" tab (682, 132).
   2) Clicked on a history item to view its details (1491, 301).
   3) Closed the details panel by clicking on "X" (1195, 334).
   4) Navigated to the "Balance" tab.
   5) Initiated a transaction by clicking on "Add Funds".
   6) Chose to pay with a card by clicking on "Pay with Card".
   7) Clicked on "Back" to return to the dashboard.

   I have considered all the logs in this session, and they indicate that the user initiated and completed all the tasks, suggesting a successful conversion.
