 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user initiated a task (clicking on "Add Item") but did not complete it, indicating that they abandoned this task. As no other tasks were completed in the log provided, we can classify this session as a drop-off.

1) [Step 1] The user navigated to the restaurant's dashboard menu page (http://localhost:5173/restaurant/dashboard/menu).
2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "Starters" section, indicating an interest in viewing the starter items.
3) [Step 3] The user scrolled through the list of starters without interacting further with any specific item.
4) [Step 4] The user clicked on the "Main Courses" section, continuing to browse the menu.
5) [Step 5] The user scrolled through the main courses, again without interacting further with any specific item.
6) [Step 6] The user clicked on the "Desserts" section, indicating an interest in viewing the dessert items.
7) [Step 7] The user clicked on the "Add Item" button, initiating a task to add an item to the menu. However, no further logs indicate that this task was completed, suggesting that the user abandoned this action.
8) [Step 8] The user scrolled through the remaining sections (Drinks, Side Dishes) without interacting with any items.
9) [Step 9] The user clicked on an svg element, but no further logs were provided to determine what action was taken after this click.
