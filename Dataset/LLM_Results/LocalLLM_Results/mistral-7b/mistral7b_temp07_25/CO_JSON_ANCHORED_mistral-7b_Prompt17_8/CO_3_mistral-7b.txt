 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user initiated tasks (clicking on the "Restaurant Login" link and then clicking on the username input field) but did not complete the task by entering any text in the username input field before leaving the page. This indicates that the user abandoned the login process, thus classifying this session as a drop-off.

   User Journey:
   1) [Step 1] The user navigated to the Restaurant Login page by clicking on the "Restaurant Login" link.
   2) [Step 2] Upon reaching the login page, the user clicked on the username input field, initiating the task of entering their username.
   3) [Step 3] However, the user did not complete the task by entering any text in the username input field and left the page without further interaction. This suggests that the user abandoned the login process, classifying this session as a drop-off.
