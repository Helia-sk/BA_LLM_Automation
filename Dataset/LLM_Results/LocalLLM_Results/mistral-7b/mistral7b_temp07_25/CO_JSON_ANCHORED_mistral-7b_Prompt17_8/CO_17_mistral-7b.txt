 Tag: Conversion

   Reason: The user initiated two tasks (navigation to "Restaurants" and selecting a specific restaurant, indicated by clicking on "No image available") and completed both of them.

   1) [Step 1] User navigated from the homepage ("http://localhost:5173/customer/dashboard") to the "Restaurants" section by clicking on the "Restaurants" link at x=394, y=128.
   2) [Step 2] User scrolled down the list of restaurants and scrolled all the way to the bottom before scrolling back up (indicated by two scroll events with a change in scrollY from 1324 to 0).
   3) [Step 3] User selected a specific restaurant by clicking on the "No image available" div at x=920, y=666. This action indicates that they have initiated an interaction with the chosen restaurant, suggesting further exploration or engagement (e.g., placing an order or viewing more details).
   The user completed all the initiated tasks, so the session was classified as a conversion. All logs were considered to the end.
