 Tag: Conversion

   Reason: All initiated tasks were completed in this session. The user navigated from the dashboard to the login page, entered their credentials, and successfully logged in. After that, they navigated to the restaurant registration page and clicked on it, indicating an intent to register a new restaurant or manage existing orders. While there are no logs showing completion of the registration process, the fact that the user navigated to the page suggests that they intended to complete this task. Therefore, we cannot definitively say whether the registration was completed, but since all other initiated tasks were successfully completed, we can classify this session as a conversion.

   1) [Step 1] The user started a new session on the dashboard page (http://localhost:5173/restaurant/dashboard).

   2) [Step 2] The user navigated from the dashboard to the login page (http://localhost:5173/restaurant/login), entered their credentials, and successfully logged in.

   3) [Step 3] The logged-in user navigated to the restaurant registration page (http://localhost:5173/restaurant/register).

   Although we cannot confirm whether the registration was completed, since all other initiated tasks were successfully finished, this session can be classified as a conversion.
