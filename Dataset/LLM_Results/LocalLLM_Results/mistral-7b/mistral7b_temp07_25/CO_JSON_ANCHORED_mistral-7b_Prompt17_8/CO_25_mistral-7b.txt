 Tag: Conversion

   Reason: All the initiated tasks in the log file have been completed. The user navigated to the menu page, scrolled through it, and clicked on a menu item, which indicates interaction with the intended content. There is no evidence of any task abandonment or interruption.

   1) [Step 1] The user accessed the restaurant's dashboard (URL: http://localhost:5173/restaurant/dashboard/menu).

   2) [Step 2] The user scrolled down on the menu page to position (81, 0), indicating they were interacting with the content.

   3) [Step 3] The user clicked on a menu item located at coordinates (571, 125). This action triggered an event suggesting the user made a selection from the menu.

   4) [Step 4] No subsequent logs suggest further interactions or tasks, implying the user might have completed their intended actions and left the page or site. However, since there are no log entries to confirm this, it is not definitively stated that the user has completely exited the session.
