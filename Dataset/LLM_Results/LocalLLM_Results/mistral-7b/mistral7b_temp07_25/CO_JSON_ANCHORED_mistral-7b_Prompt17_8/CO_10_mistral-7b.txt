 Tag: Drop-Off

   Reason: The user initiated tasks by clicking on "Balance", then "Orders", and finally "View Details". However, the user did not complete any of these tasks, instead, they clicked on "Orders" again and then "Cart" before exiting the session. This indicates that the user had an intention to perform certain actions, but did not follow through with them, suggesting a drop-off.

   1) [Step 1] The user started the session by navigating to the customer dashboard.
   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on "Balance" to check their account balance.
   3) [Step 3] The user then decided to view their orders by clicking on "Orders".
   4) [Step 4] Instead of viewing their orders, the user clicked on "Orders" again, indicating a change in decision or confusion.
   5) [Step 5] The user clicked on "Cart", suggesting an intent to make a purchase, but did not proceed further.
   6) [Step 6] The user exited the session without completing any transaction or task they had initiated.

   It is important to note that while the user did click on multiple sections of the dashboard, none of these clicks resulted in completion of a task, indicating a drop-off.
