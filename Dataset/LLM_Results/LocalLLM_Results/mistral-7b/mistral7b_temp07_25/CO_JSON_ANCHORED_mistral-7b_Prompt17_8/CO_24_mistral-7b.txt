==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off

   Reason: The user did not complete any of the initiated tasks, such as uploading an image for a menu item, saving changes to a menu item, or navigating away from the page. While the user clicked on various elements throughout the session (like the "Menu" link), none of these actions led to the completion of a task.

   1) [Step 1] The user accessed the restaurant dashboard menu page ("/restaurant/dashboard/menu").
   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on an SVG element, but it's not clear what this action triggered or its purpose in the context of the session.
   3) [Step 3] The user navigated to a form containing the option to add menu items with categories like starters, main courses, desserts, drinks, and side dishes.
   4) [Step 4] The user clicked on the form but did not interact further with it (did not upload an image or save changes).
   5) [Step 5] The user clicked on a link labeled "ImageDrag image here or click to upload" within the form, but again, no further action was taken.
   6) [Step 6] The user clicked on various elements inside the form without completing any task or navigating away from it.
   It's worth noting that the log file does not show any conclusive evidence of a successful session or conversion, as the user did not complete any of the initiated tasks.
