 Tag: Conversion

   Reason: All initiated tasks in this session were completed. The user navigated from the main page to the "Settings" section, clicked on the input field, then on the "Add" button, filled out the input field with data, and finally clicked on the "Submit" button. This sequence of actions implies a completion of a task, which is a conversion in this context.
