 Tag: Drop-Off

   Reason: Although the user initiated the task of navigating to the Customer Login page, they did not complete it by entering their credentials or clicking the submit button. Instead, they navigated away from the page after clicking on a different link. Therefore, this session can be considered a drop-off as one of the initiated tasks was abandoned.

   1) [Step 1] The user navigated to the restaurant dashboard settings page (/restaurant/dashboard/settings).
   2) [Step 2] The user decided to navigate away from the restaurant dashboard and moved towards the customer login page (/customer/login) by clicking on the "Customer Login" link.
   3) [Step 3] Upon reaching the customer login page, the user did not perform any action related to entering their credentials or submitting the form. Instead, they clicked on an empty input field and then navigated away from the page by clicking on a different link.
   At this point, all logs have been considered and the session can be classified as a drop-off since one of the initiated tasks was abandoned.
