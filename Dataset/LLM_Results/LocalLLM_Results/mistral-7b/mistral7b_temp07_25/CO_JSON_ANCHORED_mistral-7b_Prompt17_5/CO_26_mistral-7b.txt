==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: Although the user clicked on the "Add Item" button, they did not complete any other initiated tasks such as uploading an image or filling out the details for the item. This suggests that the session ended without a completed action.

   User Journey Step-by-step:
   1) The user navigated to the menu page of a restaurant (http://localhost:5173/restaurant/dashboard/menu).
   2) They scrolled through the menu items and clicked on "Add Item".
   3) They were presented with an option to drag and drop or click to upload an image for the new item, but they did not interact with this option.
   4) The user was shown the price of the item, but no further action was taken.
   5) The user clicked on a button to navigate away from the page (this log does not specify where they navigated to).

   It's important to note that while the user did initiate one task by clicking "Add Item", they did not complete it, which is why this session is classified as a drop-off. The logs provided do not indicate any further actions taken by the user after the initial click on "Add Item".
