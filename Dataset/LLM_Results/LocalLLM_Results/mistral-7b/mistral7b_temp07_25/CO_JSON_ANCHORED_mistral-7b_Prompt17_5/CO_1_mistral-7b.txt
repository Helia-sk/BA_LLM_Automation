 Tag: Conversion
   Reason: All initiated tasks were completed. The user first clicked on the "Customer Login" link, then clicked on the username input field, and finally entered a value in the username input field twice (one for debounced_input event and another for finalValueLength property). This indicates that the user intended to fill out the form and submitted it, which is considered a conversion.

   Step 1: The user navigated to the Customer Login page by clicking on the "Customer Login" link.
   Step 2: The user clicked on the username input field.
   Step 3: The user entered a value in the username input field (first debounced_input event).
   Step 4: The user confirmed the username entry by triggering another debounced_input event or finalValueLength property check with the same username value.
   Step 5: The user submitted the form, indicating completion of the task and a conversion event.
