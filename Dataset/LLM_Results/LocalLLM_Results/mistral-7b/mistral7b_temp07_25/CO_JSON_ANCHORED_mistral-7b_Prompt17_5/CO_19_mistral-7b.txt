==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user did not complete the intended task (Customer Login), and instead, navigated away from the page after clicking the link to "Customer Login". This suggests that the session was not a successful conversion.

   1) [Step 1] User navigated to the restaurant dashboard settings page at "http://localhost:5173/restaurant/dashboard/settings" from an unknown source (referrer is blank).
   2) [Step 2] The user decided to access the customer login page by clicking on the "Customer Login" link.
   3) [Step 3] User clicked on the input field for username after clicking on it, but did not enter any data or perform any other actions related to the login process.
   4) [Step 4] The user then clicked away from the customer login page by clicking on an empty area.
   5) [Step 5] User navigated to the homepage ("http://localhost:5173/") through some form of navigation.
   I have considered all the logs in my decision-making process, as I have analyzed each event and its corresponding task completion status. The user did not complete the intended task (Customer Login), so the session was a drop-off.
