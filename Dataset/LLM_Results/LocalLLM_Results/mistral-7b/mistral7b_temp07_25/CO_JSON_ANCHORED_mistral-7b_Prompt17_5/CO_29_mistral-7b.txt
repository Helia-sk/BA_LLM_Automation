==================================================

 Tag: Conversion
   Reason: The user initiated a task (clicked on "History") and completed it by clicking on the "View Details" button. No abandoned tasks were observed in this session, indicating that the user interacted with all intended elements of the interface.

  1) [Step 1] The user started the session by visiting the dashboard page.
  2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "History" link on the dashboard page.
  3) [Step 3] The user navigated to the history page and interacted with the displayed data (not explicitly recorded in the log file).
  4) [Step 4] The user clicked on a specific item in the history, initiating an action to view its details.
  5) [Step 5] The user then clicked on the "View Details" button to display more information about the selected item.
  6) [Step 6] No further actions were recorded, indicating that the user may have finished browsing or interacting with the application at this point. However, since no explicit session end event was triggered, it is not possible to confirm whether the user closed the browser or continued to use another part of the application without being tracked.

   I have reviewed all logs provided, and the user completed all initiated tasks in the session, tagging it as a conversion.
