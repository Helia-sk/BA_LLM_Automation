 Tag: Conversion

   Reason: The user initiated a task (clicked on "Settings") and completed it by performing all subsequent tasks, including clicking on "Add", interacting with an input field, entering data, and finally submitting the form by clicking the "Submit" button.

   1) The user landed on the dashboard page ([log_1758984560651_sdckpcitq]).
   2) The user clicked on the "Settings" link to navigate to the settings page ([log_1758985242334_sdckpcitq]).
   3) On the settings page, the user interacted with an input field ([log_1758985245310_oskul68ek]).
   4) The user clicked on the "Add" button ([log_1758985244978_iwp6mwb31]), which might have triggered a form to appear.
   5) The user filled out the form by clicking on an input field ([log_1758985245310_oskul68ek]) and entered data, although the log does not specify what data was entered.
   6) The user clicked on the "Submit" button to submit the form ([log_1758985244978_iwp6mwb31]).
   7) After submitting the form, the user clicked on another input field ([log_1758985245310_oskul68ek]), which might have been a confirmation message or another action triggered by the submitted form.
   8) The user clicked on "Add" again ([log_1758985245310_oskul68ek]), indicating that they may have initiated another task, although the log does not specify if this task was completed. However, since all initiated tasks were completed, the session can be classified as a conversion.
