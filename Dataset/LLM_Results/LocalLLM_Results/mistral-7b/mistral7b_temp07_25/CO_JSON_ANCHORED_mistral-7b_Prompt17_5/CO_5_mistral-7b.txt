3) [Step 3] The user clicked on the "Customer Login" link ("http://localhost:5173/customer/login"), initiating a task.
4) [Step 4] The user continued scrolling, suggesting they may have been considering their next action (possibly entering their credentials), but did not complete the login process.
5) [Step 5] The user continued to navigate the page, indicating they may have lost interest or encountered an issue with the login process.
6) [Step 6] The user left the site, as indicated by the last log showing scroll events without any further interactions that would suggest completion of the login task.
