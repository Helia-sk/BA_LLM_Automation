 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user initiated tasks such as clicking on the "Menu" link, dragging an image, and clicking on a form, but did not complete any of these tasks. Instead, they clicked on other elements like an SVG and the form again without providing any input or completing any actions related to those elements.

  1) [Step 1] The user landed on the restaurant dashboard page.
  2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "Menu" link to navigate to the menu section.
  3) [Step 3] The user interacted with an SVG element but did not complete any task associated with it.
  4) [Step 4] The user clicked on a form, possibly intending to upload or edit some data, but did not provide any input or complete the form.
  5) [Step 5] The user clicked on the form again without taking any action, suggesting they may have intended to correct an error or reconsider their action, but ultimately abandoned it.
  6) [Step 6] The user spent some time interacting with various elements on the page, potentially exploring the menu options, but did not complete any tasks before leaving the session.

   All initiated tasks were not completed, indicating a drop-off. It is essential to note that every log has been considered in this analysis.
