 Tag: Drop-Off

   Reason: The user clicked on the "Customer Login" button, but did not complete any further tasks related to logging in. Specifically, the user did not click on the username input field or type anything into it, which indicates that they did not proceed with the login process. This is an example of a drop-off because one of the initiated tasks (logging in) was abandoned.

   1) [Step 1] The user navigated to the customer login page by clicking on the "Customer Login" link.
   2) [Step 2] The user did not interact with any elements related to entering a username, suggesting that they did not intend to log in at this time.
   3) [Step 3] The user did not perform any other actions that could be considered part of the login process or any other initiated tasks, indicating that the session ended without completion.
