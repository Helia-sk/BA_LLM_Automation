 Tag: Drop-Off

   Reason: The user did not complete all initiated tasks. The user started on the home page (`/customer/dashboard`) and scrolled down, but did not interact with any of the elements in the first restaurant's details section (`/customer/dashboard/restaurant/4`). Later, the user clicked on a link to view another restaurant's details (`/customer/dashboard/restaurant/5`), but did not interact with it further. After that, the user clicked on the "Restaurants" tab and scrolled down again, but no other interactions were recorded. The user then navigated back to a previous page (`/customer/dashboard`) without completing any tasks related to the second restaurant's details.

   1) [Step 1] User landed on the home page (`/customer/dashboard`).
   2) [Step 2] User scrolled down the home page, interacting with various elements.
   3) [Step 3] User clicked on a link to view the details of the first restaurant (`/customer/dashboard/restaurant/4`), but did not interact with it further.
   4) [Step 4] User clicked on the "Restaurants" tab and scrolled down, but no other interactions were recorded.
   5) [Step 5] User navigated back to the home page (`/customer/dashboard`) without completing any tasks related to the second restaurant's details.
   I have considered all the logs provided in my analysis, as I have examined each interaction and determined that the user did not complete all initiated tasks.
