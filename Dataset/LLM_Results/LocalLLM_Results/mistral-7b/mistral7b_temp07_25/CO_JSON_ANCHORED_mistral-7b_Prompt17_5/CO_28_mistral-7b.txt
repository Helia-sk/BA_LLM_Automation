 Tag: Drop-Off

   Reason: While the user initiated a login and entered their password, they did not complete the login process by clicking the "Sign In" button, suggesting that they may have abandoned the session.

   1) [Step 1] The user accessed the restaurant's website (route: /restaurant/login).
   2) [Step 2] The user entered their username and password into the login form (event_name: input_change for username and event_name: form_submit for password).
   3) [Step 3] The user blurred the password field (event_name: input_change), but did not click the "Sign In" button, indicating that they may have abandoned the login process (event_name: click for "Sign In" button was not recorded in the logs provided).
   Check: All initiated tasks were considered (login and entering username and password), but one of them was abandoned (not clicking the "Sign In" button), thus the session was a drop-off.
