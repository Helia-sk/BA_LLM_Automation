 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: One of the initiated tasks (View Details) was not completed, indicating that the user abandoned the process before finishing.
   1) [Step 1] The user navigated to the restaurant dashboard page (/restaurant/dashboard).
   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "History" link, initiating a task to view the history of the restaurant.
   3) [Step 3] The user clicked on a specific history entry, initiating another task to view details about that entry. However, this task was not completed as the log file indicates that the user did not click on any "View Details" button again.
   4) [Step 4] The user clicked on the "History" link again, but this time they clicked on the "Reject" button, which is likely because they decided to leave the site without completing their original intent of viewing details about a specific history entry.
   5) [Step 5] The user clicked on the "Back" button, returning to the restaurant dashboard page.
   6) [Step 6] The user clicked on the "History" link once more, but this time they clicked on the "Reject" button, indicating that they were sure they wanted to leave the site without completing their original intent.
   7) [Step 7] The user left the site by closing the browser or navigating away from the restaurant dashboard page. The log file does not contain any further interactions after this step.
