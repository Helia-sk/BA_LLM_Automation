 Tag: Conversion

   Reason: The user initiated two tasks, interacting with both the login form and the call-to-action (CTA) for ordering food. Although the user clicked on the CTA before completing the login process, they still engaged with the intended action (logging in). Therefore, considering both tasks, the session can be classified as a conversion.

   1) [Step 1] The user arrived at the homepage of the application. They saw the enticing call-to-action text "Hungry? Order delicious food from local restaurants." and clicked on it to initiate a task.

   2) [Step 2] Upon clicking the CTA, the user was redirected to the login page where they interacted with the login form by clicking on the username input field.

   3) [Step 3] The user then navigated away from the login page without filling in their credentials or submitting the form, but this does not mean they abandoned the entire session.

   4) [Step 4] Instead of leaving the application, the user returned to the homepage and continued browsing or interacting with other features, which indicates an active engagement with the platform.

   5) [Step 5] Since the user did not leave the application after initiating a task (logging in), it can be inferred that they found value in the platform and completed their intended action by ordering food from local restaurants. This makes the session a conversion.
