==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user initiated tasks by clicking on "Orders" and then "Balance", but did not complete any of those tasks. Instead, they navigated back to the "Orders" page again and clicked on "View Details", which indicates that they were likely investigating their orders further, but did not proceed with that task either. After this, they clicked on "Orders" again, suggesting a potential intention to continue viewing their orders, but no subsequent actions were taken to confirm or deny this intention. Therefore, as the user did not complete any tasks initiated during the session, it is classified as a drop-off.

  1) [Step 1] The user accessed the customer dashboard page.
  2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "Orders" link to navigate to the orders page.
  3) [Step 3] The user clicked on the "Balance" link to navigate to the balance page.
  4) [Step 4] The user returned to the "Orders" page by clicking on it again.
  5) [Step 5] The user clicked on the "View Details" button for an order, indicating potential interest in that task, but did not complete it.
  6) [Step 6] The user clicked on the "Orders" link once more, suggesting a potential intention to continue viewing their orders, but no subsequent actions were taken to confirm or deny this intention.

   It is important to note that all initiated tasks were abandoned during this session, which led to classifying it as a drop-off. Additionally, it should be considered whether the user encountered any issues or obstacles during the session that may have caused them to abandon their actions, such as errors, poor usability, or confusion. These factors could potentially influence future decisions about user engagement and site design.
