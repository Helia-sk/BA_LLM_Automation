 Tag: Conversion

   Reason: The session was a conversion because all the initiated tasks were completed. The user clicked on the "Menu" link, navigated to the menu page, selected an item, and finally clicked the "Add Item" button. There is no evidence of any task being abandoned during this session.

   1) [Step 1] The user initiated a session by opening the application (not shown in logs).

   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "Menu" link to navigate to the menu page.

   3) [Step 3] On the menu page, the user selected an item.

   4) [Step 4] The user clicked the "Add Item" button to add the selected item to their cart.

   The logs provided do not show any further actions by the user, so it is assumed that they completed their task and exited the application. However, if additional logs were available showing the user completing a checkout process or other post-add-item actions, those would also support a conclusion of conversion.
