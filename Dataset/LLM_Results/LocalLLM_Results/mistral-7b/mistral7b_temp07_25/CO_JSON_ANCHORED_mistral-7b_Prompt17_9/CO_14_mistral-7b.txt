 Tag: Conversion

   Reason: The user initiated a click on the "Customer Login" link, then clicked on the username input field twice (one for focus and one to type in the username), typed in "User1", and then clicked on the password input field. After that, the user clicked on the username input field again without typing anything, which is likely to confirm the username, and finally clicked on the password input field to focus on it. Since all initiated tasks were completed (clicking the login link, entering a username, and focusing on the password field), this session can be classified as a conversion.

   1) The user visited the customer login page (http://localhost:5173/customer/login).
   2) The user clicked on the "Customer Login" button.
   3) The user clicked on the username input field to focus it and then typed in "User1".
   4) The user clicked on the password input field to focus it.
   5) The user clicked on the username input field again without typing anything, which is likely to confirm the username.
   6) (Assumption based on typical login behavior) The user entered a password in the password input field and then clicked on the login button, thus completing the login process. However, since we only have logs up to step 5, it cannot be confirmed if this step was completed or not.
