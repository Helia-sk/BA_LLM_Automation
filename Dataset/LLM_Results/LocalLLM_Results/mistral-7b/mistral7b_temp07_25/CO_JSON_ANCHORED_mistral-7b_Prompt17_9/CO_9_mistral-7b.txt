 Tag: Drop-Off

   Reason: The user initiated tasks by scrolling through the page and clicking on an image, but subsequently did not complete any other actions such as scrolling further down the page (after the first scroll event) or interacting with any other elements. This indicates that the user did not find what they were looking for or lost interest in the content, resulting in a drop-off.

   1) The session started with the user landing on the customer dashboard page.

   2) The user scrolled down the page (first scroll event).

   3) The user clicked on an image within a restaurant's details section (restaurant/4).

   4) After clicking the image, the user did not perform any other actions such as scrolling further down the page or interacting with any other elements.

   It is important to note that even though the user clicked on an image, this action was not followed by any additional interactions, which suggests that they did not complete their intended task (e.g., viewing more details about the restaurant). This indicates a drop-off in the session.
