 Tag: Conversion

   Reason: All initiated tasks in the session were completed. The user first navigated to the "/restaurant/dashboard" page, which indicates they were already logged in or registered. Then, they clicked on a link to go to the login/registration page for restaurants, likely because they wanted to manage orders. After that, they interacted with two input fields (username and password), which suggests they were trying to log in or register. Finally, they entered something into both fields, indicating they have completed either the login or registration process successfully, and then navigated away from the page.

   1) The user initially visited the restaurant dashboard page (/restaurant/dashboard).
   2) The user clicked on a link to go to the login/registration page for restaurants.
   3) The user interacted with two input fields, username and password.
   4) The user entered something into both input fields, indicating they have completed either the login or registration process successfully.
   5) The user navigated away from the page, which suggests they have completed their intended task on the platform.

   All logs were considered in making this decision.
