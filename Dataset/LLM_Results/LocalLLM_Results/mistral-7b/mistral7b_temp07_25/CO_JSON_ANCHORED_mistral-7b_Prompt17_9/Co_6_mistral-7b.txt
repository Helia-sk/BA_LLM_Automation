==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user clicked on the "Customer Login" link, but did not complete the subsequent tasks such as entering a username and password. Instead, they navigated away from the login form by clicking outside of it. Therefore, since one of the initiated tasks was abandoned, we classify this session as a drop-off.

   User Journey:
   1) The user landed on the homepage.
   2) The user clicked on the "Customer Login" link.
   3) The user navigated to the login page.
   4) The user did not enter any credentials and instead, they clicked outside of the login form, navigating away from it.
   As all logs have been reviewed, we can confirm that this is a complete set of data for this session.
