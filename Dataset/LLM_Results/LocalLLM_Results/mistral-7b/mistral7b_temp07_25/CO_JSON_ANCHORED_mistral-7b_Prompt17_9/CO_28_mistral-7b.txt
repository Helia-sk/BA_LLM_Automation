==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off

   Reason: The user initiated a login process, but did not complete it. Specifically, after entering their username and password, they clicked the "Sign In" button (log with id "log_1758985849132_sm9gb6j5r"), but did not follow through with the form submission (log with id "log_1758985849134_5na5ry90h"). This indicates that they abandoned one of the initiated tasks.

   1) [Step 1] The user navigated to the login page for a restaurant website ("http://localhost:5173/restaurant/login").

   2) [Step 2] The user entered their username and password into the respective input fields (logs with id "log_1758985849032_pt9psc4kp" and "log_1758985849134_5na5ry90h").

   3) [Step 3] The user clicked the "Sign In" button, but did not submit the form (logs with id "log_1758985849132_sm9gb6j5r" and "log_1758985849134_5na5ry90h").

   I have considered all the logs in my decision making. The user did not complete all initiated tasks, so the session was a drop-off.
