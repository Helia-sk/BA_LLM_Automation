==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user clicked on the "Customer Login" link, but did not proceed to fill out the username or password fields. This indicates that the initiated task (logging in) was abandoned.

   1) [Step 1] User navigated to the customer login page by clicking on the "Customer Login" link.
   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the username input field, indicating they intended to enter their username.
   3) [Step 3] No further logs indicate that the user entered a username or password.
   4) [Step 4] The user clicked on the password input field, but did not interact with it further, suggesting they did not provide a password.
   5) [Step 5] No subsequent interaction was observed in the log files, indicating the session was abandoned (drop-off).

Note: All logs have been considered to reach this conclusion. The user initiated the task of logging in but did not complete it, hence the tag as Drop-Off.
