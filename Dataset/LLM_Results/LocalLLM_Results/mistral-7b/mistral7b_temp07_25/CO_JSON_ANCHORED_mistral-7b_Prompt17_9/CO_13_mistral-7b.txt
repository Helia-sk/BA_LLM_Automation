==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: Although the user initiated tasks by clicking on "History", "View Details", and "X", they did not complete any of those tasks. Instead, they clicked on the "X" button after viewing the details, indicating that they may have abandoned the process before completing it.

  1) [Step 1] The user visited the restaurant dashboard page (/restaurant/dashboard).
  2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "History" link to navigate to the history section of the dashboard.
  3) [Step 3] The user clicked on a specific item in the history section, initiating the "View Details" process.
  4) [Step 4] The user viewed the details of the selected item but then clicked on the "X" button to close it, abandoning the process.

The logs provided do not show any further interactions or completed tasks, so it can be inferred that the session was a drop-off as one of the initiated tasks (viewing details) was abandoned.
