==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off

   Reason: The user initiated a task (scrolling down the page) multiple times, but it appears that they did not complete any of the tasks on the page (clicking on a link, filling out a form, making a purchase). After scrolling through the page to the bottom, they left the site without performing any of the actions typically associated with a conversion.

   1) [Step 1] The user arrived at the homepage ("/customer/dashboard"). They started scrolling down the page ("scroll" events).
   2) [Step 2] The user continued to scroll down the page, reaching different sections of the page and showing interest in various content. However, they did not interact with any clickable elements or perform actions typically associated with a conversion.
   3) [Step 3] After scrolling through the entire page, the user left the site without performing any action that would indicate a conversion.

   I have considered all the logs provided, and based on the lack of completed tasks, I have classified this session as a drop-off.
