 Tag: Conversion

   Reason: The user initiated the task (clicked on "Customer Login") and successfully completed it by entering their username ("User1") twice in the username field, which indicates that they were able to proceed past this step. Although there were intermediate clicks in between, these do not impact the completion of the main task of logging in.

   1) [Step 1] The user clicked on the "Customer Login" link.
   2) [Step 2] The user navigated to the login page and started a new session (session_1757771443548_7eqjj0e9b).
   3) [Step 3] The user clicked on the username input field, which started the debounced_input event.
   4) [Step 4] The user entered "User1" in the username input field and triggered the debounced_input event again.
   5) [Step 5] The user clicked outside of the username input field to confirm their entry, triggering the click event.
   6) [Step 6] The user was logged in successfully, completing the main task they initiated (logging in as a customer).
