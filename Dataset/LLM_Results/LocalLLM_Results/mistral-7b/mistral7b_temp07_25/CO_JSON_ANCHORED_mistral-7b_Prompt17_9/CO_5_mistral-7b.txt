==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user initiated a task (clicking on "Customer Login") but did not complete it, indicating that they left the site without completing the desired action.

   Step 1) The user arrived at the homepage of the website ("http://localhost:5173/").
   Step 2) The user scrolled down the homepage slightly.
   Step 3) The user then navigated to the "Customer Login" page ("http://localhost:5173/customer/login"). This could be considered as initiating a task, as it is likely that the user intended to log in.
   Step 4) The user scrolled down the "Customer Login" page slightly but did not fill out any form fields or click the submit button, indicating that they abandoned the task of logging in.
   Step 5) The user then left the site without performing any other actions, as there are no further logs to suggest otherwise.

   All initiated tasks were not completed, so based on the provided conditions, the session was a drop-off. It is important to note that this classification assumes that the desired action for this website is user login. If other actions are intended, additional logs would be needed to accurately classify the session.
