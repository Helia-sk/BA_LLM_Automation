==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user initiated a task by clicking on "Add Item", but did not complete it, suggesting that they left the page without adding an item to their cart. This is indicative of a drop-off.

   User Journey Step-by-step:
   1) [Step 1] The user navigated to the menu items page ("/restaurant/dashboard/menu").
   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "Add Item" button, initiating a task. However, this was not completed, indicating that they left the page without adding an item.
   3) [Step 3] The user navigated to the section where items could be dragged and dropped or uploaded, but did not interact further with these options.
   4) [Step 4] The user clicked on the "Saladmixvery healthy" item, indicating potential interest but did not proceed to add it to their cart.
   5) [Step 5] The user clicked on an image upload area ("svg") but did not interact further with it.
   6) [Step 6] The user navigated away from the page by clicking elsewhere on the screen, ending the session without completing any initiated tasks.
   I have considered all the logs provided to reach this conclusion.
