==================================================

 Tag: Conversion
   Reason: The session initiated with a HTTP request to accept an order, which is one of the tasks. The subsequent OPTIONS requests and clicks on UI elements can be considered as system checks or additional interactions, not part of the primary task. However, the final HTTP response with status code 200 indicates successful completion of the 'accept_order' task, implying the session resulted in a conversion.

  1) [Step 1] The user initiated the session by sending an HTTP request (POST) to accept an order on the backend server (route: "/api/orders/26/accept").
  2) [Step 2] The backend sent an OPTIONS request to check for allowed HTTP methods, and returned a successful response (status code 200). This is a normal system behavior.
  3) [Step 3] The user interacted with the UI elements on the frontend, which were tracked as 'click' events. These interactions are likely part of the user experience but not directly related to the primary task of accepting an order.
  4) [Step 4] The backend processed the request and sent a final HTTP response (POST) to confirm the acceptance of the order (status code 200), indicating successful completion of the task.

All initiated tasks were completed, so the session resulted in a conversion.
