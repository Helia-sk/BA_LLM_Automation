 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user clicked on the "Customer Login" link, but did not complete any subsequent tasks related to logging in or navigating to the customer dashboard. Instead, they scrolled and then left the page.

   1) [Step 1] The user visited the homepage of the website ("http://localhost:5173/") at time "2025-09-13T14:16:53.317Z".
   2) [Step 2] The user scrolled down the page to position (y = 139.1999969482422) at time "2025-09-13T14:16:52.670Z".
   3) [Step 3] The user clicked on the "Customer Login" link at position (x = 598, y = 37) at time "2025-09-13T14:16:55.075Z".
   4) [Step 4] The user scrolled again to the top of the page ("y" value became 0) at time "2025-09-13T14:16:53.317Z".
   5) [Step 5] The user then left the page, as indicated by no further interactions or scroll events.

The analysis of the log file considered all initiated tasks and determined that since one of the initiated tasks (logging in) was abandoned, the session is classified as a drop-off.
