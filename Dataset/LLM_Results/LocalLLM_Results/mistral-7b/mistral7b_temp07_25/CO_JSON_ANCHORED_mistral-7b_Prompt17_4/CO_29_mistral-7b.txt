==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user initiated tasks by clicking on "History", but did not complete it as they clicked on the "X" button to close the page, suggesting an abandonment.

   1) [Step 1] User navigated to the dashboard (/restaurant/dashboard).
   2) [Step 2] User clicked on "History" from the dashboard.
   3) [Step 3] User opened the details of a history item by clicking "View Details".
   4) [Step 4] User decided to close the page by clicking the "X" button, leaving the "History" page incomplete.
   In this case, all initiated tasks were not completed, so the session is classified as a drop-off. It's important to note that the user showed interest in the history section but chose to leave it incomplete. To make sure I considered all logs, the last log indicates the user closed the page, which implies an abandonment of the "History" task.
