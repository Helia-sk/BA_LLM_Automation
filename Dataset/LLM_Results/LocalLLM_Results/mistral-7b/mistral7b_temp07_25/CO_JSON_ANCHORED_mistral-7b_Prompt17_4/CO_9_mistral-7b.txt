==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off

   Reason: Although the user navigated through some pages, they did not complete any of the initiated tasks such as clicking on the image or scrolling to the bottom of the page. Instead, they repeatedly scrolled up and down without taking any further action that could be considered a conversion.

   1) [Step 1] The user visited the customer dashboard (/customer/dashboard).
   2) [Step 2] They navigated to a specific restaurant page (/customer/dashboard/restaurant/4).
   3) [Step 3] The user scrolled up and down on the restaurant page without interacting with any elements.
   4) [Step 4] They clicked on an image place holder ("No image available") but did not take any further action related to that restaurant or initiate a new task.
   5) [Step 5] The user continued scrolling up and down on the restaurant page without interacting with other elements.
   6) [Step 6] They navigated back to the customer dashboard (/customer/dashboard).
   7) [Step 7] They clicked on the "Restaurants" option, indicating they wanted to browse more restaurants.
   8) [Step 8] The user scrolled up and down on the customer dashboard page without interacting with any elements.
   9) [Step 9] They clicked on the "Restaurants" option again, suggesting that they might have been trying to access a different restaurant or section of the website.
   At this point, it is evident that the user did not complete any initiated tasks, so we classify this session as a drop-off. It's essential to consider all logs before making a decision to ensure accuracy.
