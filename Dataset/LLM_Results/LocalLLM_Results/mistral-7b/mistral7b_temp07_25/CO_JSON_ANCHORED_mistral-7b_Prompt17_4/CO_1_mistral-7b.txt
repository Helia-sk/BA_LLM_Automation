 Tag: Drop-Off

   Reason: One of the initiated tasks was abandoned, specifically the user clicked on the "Customer Login" link but did not proceed to fill out the username field. While it's possible that the user might return and complete the task later, without further context or additional logs, we cannot definitively classify this as a conversion.

   1) [Step 1] The user opened the webpage at http://localhost:5173/customer/login.
   2) [Step 2] The user navigated to the username input field but did not interact with it.
   3) [Step 3] The user clicked on the "Customer Login" link, indicating an intent to start the login process, but did not proceed to fill out the username field.
   4) [Step 4] The user's interaction ended as no further logs were provided for this session, suggesting that the task was abandoned or the user navigated away from the page without completing the login process.
