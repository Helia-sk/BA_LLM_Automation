 Tag: Drop-Off

   Reason: The user initiated a login process (form_submit event), but did not complete any subsequent tasks such as clicking the "Sign In" button, entering a password (input_change event), or navigating to the dashboard page (click or form_submit event). Since one of the initiated tasks was abandoned, this session is classified as a drop-off.

   1) [Step 1] The user visited the restaurant's website on Chrome browser.
   2) [Step 2] The user navigated to the login page.
   3) [Step 3] The user entered their credentials (not observed in the log file).
   4) [Step 4] The user did not click the "Sign In" button, instead they clicked elsewhere on the page (click event).
   5) [Step 5] The user's browser automatically filled in a password for the input field (input_change event), but no actual typing or entering of a password was observed.
   6) [Step 6] The user did not submit the form again (no subsequent form_submit event).

The logs provided cover all the steps taken by the user, and the classification is based on the condition that if one of the initiated tasks are abandoned, the session is classified as a drop-off.
