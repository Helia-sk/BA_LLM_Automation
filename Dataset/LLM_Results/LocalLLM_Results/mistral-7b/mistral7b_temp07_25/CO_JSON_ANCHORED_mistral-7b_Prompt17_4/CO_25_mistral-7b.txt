==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: One of the initiated tasks (the click on the "Menu" button) was performed, but it seems that no further tasks related to the session were completed. The scroll event and click event at the end of the log file do not appear to be directly related to the menu navigation or any other task initiated in this session.

  1) [Step 1] User navigated to the restaurant dashboard (URL: http://localhost:5173/restaurant/dashboard/menu).
  2) [Step 2] User clicked on the "Menu" button located at coordinates (x=571, y=125).
  3) [Step 3] User scrolled down the page to coordinate (y = 81) and then up to coordinate (y = 0).
  4) [Step 4] User performed another scroll event but the coordinates were not provided.
  5) [Step 5] User clicked on an SVG element located at coordinates (x=1134, y=588). This click event does not seem to be directly related to any other task initiated in this session.

All the logs were considered in making this decision. The user did not complete any other tasks after clicking the "Menu" button, so the session was classified as a drop-off.
