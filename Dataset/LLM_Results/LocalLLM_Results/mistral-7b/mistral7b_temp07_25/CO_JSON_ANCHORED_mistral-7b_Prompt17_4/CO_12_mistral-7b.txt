 Tag: Conversion

   Reason: All initiated tasks in this session were completed. The user clicked on the "Menu" link, navigated to the menu page, selected an item by clicking the "Add Item" button, and then entered some text into a text field (indicated by a click event on an input field). Since the user performed all expected actions and did not abandon any of them, this session can be classified as a conversion.

   1) The user accessed the restaurant dashboard page.
   2) The user navigated to the menu page by clicking the "Menu" link.
   3) The user selected an item from the menu by clicking the "Add Item" button.
   4) The user entered text into a form field (indicated by a click event on an input field), which is typically associated with adding details about the item being added to the cart. However, since we don't have information about the specific input field and its purpose, it remains unclear what exactly the user was doing at this step.
   Note that I considered all logs in my decision making process. The user performed all initiated tasks (accessing the dashboard page, navigating to the menu page, selecting an item, and entering text into a form field), so the session can be classified as a conversion.
