 Tag: Drop-Off

   Reason: The user clicked on the "Customer Login" link, which initiated a session. However, after clicking on the login form, no further logs indicate that the user submitted their credentials or proceeded with any other actions within the session.

   2) The user navigated to the login page by clicking on the "Customer Login" link. [Navigation]
   3) The user initiated a login session by clicking on the login form. [Initiated Task]
