 Tag: Drop-Off

   Reason: Although there are multiple clicks on various buttons, it seems that one of the initiated tasks (View Details) was not completed. The user clicked on the "View Details" button but there is no subsequent log indicating that the user continued to interact with the page containing the details. This suggests that the user may have navigated away from that page, signifying a drop-off.

   1) [Step 1] User accessed the restaurant dashboard history page (indicated by the click event on the "History" link).
   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "X" button to close an element on the page, possibly a notification or filter (indicated by the corresponding click event).
   3) [Step 3] The user clicked on the "View Details" button, initiating an action to view details of a specific item (indicated by the click event). However, there is no subsequent log indicating that the user continued interacting with the page containing the details. This suggests that the user may have navigated away from that page, leading to a drop-off.
   Note: It is important to consider all logs before making a decision to ensure accuracy. In this case, the absence of a log indicating completion of the "View Details" action is crucial in classifying the session as a drop-off.
