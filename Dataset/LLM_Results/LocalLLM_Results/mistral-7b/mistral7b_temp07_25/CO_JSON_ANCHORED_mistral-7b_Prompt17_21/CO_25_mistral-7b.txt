 Tag: Conversion

   Reason: The user initiated a task (clicking on the "Menu" link) and completed it by scrolling through the menu page. The subsequent logs do not show any further actions indicating abandonment of the session, which suggests that the user has completed their intended action.

   1) [Step 1] User navigated to the restaurant dashboard page (url: "http://localhost:5173/restaurant/dashboard").
   2) [Step 2] User clicked on the "Menu" link located at coordinates (x=571, y=125).
   3) [Step 3] User scrolled through the menu page reaching a scroll position of (scrollY=81) indicating they were viewing the content.
   4) [Step 4] No further actions were recorded in the log file, suggesting that the user may have completed their intended action on the menu page and potentially left the site or moved to another page without initiating another task. However, since no such logs were recorded, it's not possible to definitively confirm this step.

   Since all initiated tasks (clicking "Menu" and scrolling through the menu) were completed, this session can be classified as a Conversion.
