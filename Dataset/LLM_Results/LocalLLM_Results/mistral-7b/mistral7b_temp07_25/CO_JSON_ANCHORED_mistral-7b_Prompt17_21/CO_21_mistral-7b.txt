 Tag: Conversion
   Reason: The user initiated a task (clicking on the "Restaurant PartnersRegister your restaurant or log in to manage orders") and then proceeded with another task (typing information into the username field). Although there was an abandonment of one task (not entering anything into the password field), it is possible that this was due to a temporary interruption or oversight, as the user continued with other tasks. The final step, where the user navigated away from the login page and then back to it, suggests a persistent intent to complete the session.

  1) [Step 1] User navigates to the homepage ("/") from another page (referrer: "http://localhost:5173/restaurant/dashboard").
  2) [Step 2] User clicks on the link "Restaurant PartnersRegister your restaurant or log in to manage orders".
  3) [Step 3] User arrives at the login page ("/restaurant/login") and clicks on the username field.
  4) [Step 4] User types information into the username field (indicated by the "username_length" property, although the value is not provided in the logs, it can be inferred that something was typed).
  5) [Step 5] User does not enter any information into the password field.
  6) [Step 6] User navigates away from the login page and then back to it, indicating a persistent intent to complete the session.
  7) [Step 7] User remains on the login page, suggesting either a completion or an abandonment of the session (the logs do not provide further information about this step).
