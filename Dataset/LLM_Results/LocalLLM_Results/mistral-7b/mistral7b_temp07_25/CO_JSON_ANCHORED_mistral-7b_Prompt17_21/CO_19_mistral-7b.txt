==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off

   Reason: The user clicked on the "Customer Login" button but did not complete the login process. This is evident because there are logs of a click event on the username input field and password input field, but there are no subsequent logs indicating that the user entered any credentials or clicked the submit button.

   1) [Step 1] The user navigated to the homepage ("/") from the restaurant dashboard settings page.
   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "Customer Login" link located at the top right corner of the homepage.
   3) [Step 3] The user clicked on the username input field but did not enter any data or perform any other action related to the login process.
   4) [Step 4] The user clicked on the password input field but did not enter any data or perform any other action related to the login process.

   Note: Although there is a log indicating a click event on the "Customer Login" button after the user clicked on the username and password input fields, this does not necessarily mean that the user completed the login process. The user might have clicked the button without entering any credentials, which would still count as an abandonment of the login task.

   To confirm this classification, it's important to consider all logs, including the ones after the last steps provided above. If there are no subsequent logs indicating that the user completed the login process or performed any other actions related to the desired conversion, then the session can be classified as a drop-off.
