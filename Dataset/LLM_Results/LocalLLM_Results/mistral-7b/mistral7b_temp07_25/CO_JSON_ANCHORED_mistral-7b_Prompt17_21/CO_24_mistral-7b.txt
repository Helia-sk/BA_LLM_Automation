==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user initiated a task (clicking on the "Menu" link) but did not complete it, as indicated by the subsequent logs showing clicks on other elements within the Menu page without any further interaction with the form to add or edit menu items.

  1) [Step 1] User navigated to the dashboard page of the restaurant application.
  2) [Step 2] User clicked on the "Menu" link located at x:586, y:124.
  3) [Step 3] User clicked on an svg element (possibly an image upload area) at x:664, y:338.
  4) [Step 4] User clicked on a form element at x:889, y:695 but did not proceed to add or edit any menu items as indicated by the lack of further interaction with the form elements.
  5) [Step 5] User clicked on multiple input fields within the form area (Starters, Main Courses, Desserts, Drinks, Side Dishes, Name, Description, Price, Available for order, Cancel, Save Changes). However, these clicks do not indicate completion of a task as there is no subsequent interaction with the "Save Changes" button.
  6) [Step 6] User clicked on an image drag area (ImageDrag image here or click to upload). This action, like the previous ones, does not seem to lead to the completion of a task.
  7) [Step 7] The session ended without any indication of the user returning to the form area or completing any other tasks within the application.

   All initiated tasks were abandoned, so the session was classified as a drop-off. It's important to note that this classification is based on the available data and may change if new information is provided about the user's interaction with the application.
