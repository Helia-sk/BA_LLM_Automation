 Tag: Conversion

   Reason: The user initiated a task (clicking on "History") and completed it by clicking on "View Details". There is no indication that any other tasks were abandoned.

   1) [Step 1] The user navigated to the restaurant dashboard page (page_view event).
   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "History" link, initiating a task.
   3) [Step 3] The user clicked on the "View Details" button, completing the initiated task and indicating a conversion.

   I have considered all the logs provided in this response as there are no additional interactions after the completion of the "View Details" action that could indicate an abandoned task or a drop-off.
