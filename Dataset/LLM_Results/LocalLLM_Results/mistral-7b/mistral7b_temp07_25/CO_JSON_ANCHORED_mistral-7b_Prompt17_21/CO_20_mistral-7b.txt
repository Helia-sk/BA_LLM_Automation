==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The initiated task (submission of username and password in the form) was not completed. The user clicked on the username field, then the password field, but did not complete the submission by clicking the submit button. Instead, the user navigated away from the form by clicking a different link ("Hungry? Order delicious food from local restaurants").

  1) [Step 1] User landed on the login page (http://localhost:5173/customer/login). The user initiated the task of logging in by clicking the username field.

  2) [Step 2] The user then clicked on the password field, indicating that they were preparing to input their password.

  3) [Step 3] Instead of completing the login process, the user navigated away from the form by clicking the "Hungry? Order delicious food from local restaurants" link, which was located at x=1197, y=430 on the page. This action implies that they abandoned the login task and likely navigated to a different part of the site or left the site altogether.

   All initiated tasks were not completed, hence the session was a drop-off. The user journey ended with the user navigating away from the form by clicking the link "Hungry? Order delicious food from local restaurants".
