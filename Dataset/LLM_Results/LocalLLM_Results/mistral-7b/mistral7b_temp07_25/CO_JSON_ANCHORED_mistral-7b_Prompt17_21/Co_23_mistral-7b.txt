 Tag: Conversion

   Reason: All the initiated tasks in this session were completed. The user clicked on the "Settings" link, then clicked twice on the "Add" button, interacted with the input field, and finally submitted the form by clicking the submit button.

   1) [Step 1] The user navigated to the restaurant dashboard page.
   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "Settings" link located at x:831, y:135.
   3) [Step 3] The user arrived at the settings page and interacted with two "Add" buttons. This could indicate an attempt to add something to the settings.
   4) [Step 4] The user clicked on an input field, potentially preparing to enter data into it.
   5) [Step 5] The user clicked on the submit button, which would send any entered data if there was any. This action completes all the initiated tasks and signifies a conversion in this session.

   In this log file, all the events point towards a sequence of actions that lead to a completion of a task (in this case, adding something to the settings). Therefore, it is considered a conversion. All the logs were considered in making this decision.
