 Tag: Drop-Off

   Reason: The user initiated a task by clicking on the "Customer Login" link, but did not complete the subsequent tasks related to entering a username or password. The user clicked on the username input field twice without providing any input, suggesting they may have been preparing to enter their username, but then did not proceed further.

   1) [Step 1] The user navigated to the webpage with the title "Customer Login".
   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "Customer Login" button located at x = 1644, y = 37.
   3) [Step 3] The user clicked on the username input field twice without entering any data.
   4) [Step 4] The user did not proceed to click on or interact with the password input field or the login button.
   5) [Step 5] The session ended as the user did not complete any further tasks.

   All initiated tasks were not completed, therefore, this session was classified as a drop-off. It is important to note that all logs were considered in this decision making process.
