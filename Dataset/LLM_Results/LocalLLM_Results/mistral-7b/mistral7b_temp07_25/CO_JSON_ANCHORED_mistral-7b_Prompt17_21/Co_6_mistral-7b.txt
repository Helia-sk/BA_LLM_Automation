 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: Not all initiated tasks were completed. The user clicked on the "Customer Login" link, but did not proceed to fill out the username and password fields, nor did they submit the form.

   Step 2) The user navigated to the customer login page by clicking on the "Customer Login" link (URL: http://localhost:5173/customer/login).

   Step 4) The user clicked on the password input field but did not enter any text.
   Step 5) The user did not submit the form by clicking on it or pressing the Enter key.
   Step 6) The user left the page without performing any further actions.

I have considered all the logs provided to reach this decision and classification.
