==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off

   Reason: Although the user initiated the task of adding an item to the menu, they did not complete it. Instead, they clicked on a different item in the list (Menu Items), which suggests they might have been exploring more options but didn't add anything. Furthermore, the user clicked on "All Items" and "Starters," but there is no log indicating that they actually selected an item from those categories.

   1) [Step 1] The user navigated to the restaurant dashboard menu page (/restaurant/dashboard/menu).
   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "Add Item" button.
   3) [Step 3] The user interacted with the drag-and-drop or click-to-upload area, but there is no log indicating that they successfully uploaded an image or added a new item.
   4) [Step 4] The user clicked on "Menu Items" and "All Items," suggesting they were browsing more options but did not select anything.
   5) [Step 5] The user clicked on the "Starters" category, again indicating potential interest but no action taken to select an item.
   After reviewing all logs, it appears that the initiated task (adding an item) was abandoned, so this session should be classified as a drop-off.
