 Tag: Conversion

   Reason: The user initiated two tasks (visiting the "Restaurants" page and selecting a specific restaurant, identified by the URL "/customer/dashboard/restaurant/9") out of three available options (also including "Orders" and "Profile"). The user completed both tasks without any apparent drop-offs or abandons.

   1) [Step 1] The user landed on the customer dashboard page ("http://localhost:5173/customer/dashboard")
   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "Restaurants" link on the dashboard, which led them to a list of available restaurants.
   3) [Step 3] The user scrolled through the list of restaurants and clicked on one specific restaurant (identified by the URL "/customer/dashboard/restaurant/9").
   4) [Step 4] The user interacted with the image for that selected restaurant, but no further logs indicate any additional actions after this step. However, since the user initiated and completed two out of three available tasks, it is reasonable to assume they have successfully completed their intended action (selecting a restaurant) or are still engaged in the process (e.g., waiting for more information to load).

   In conclusion, the session was considered a conversion because the user completed all initiated tasks without apparent drop-offs or abandons. All logs were taken into consideration during the decision-making process.
