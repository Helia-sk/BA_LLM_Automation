==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off

   Reason: The user initiated tasks (clicked on "Restaurant Login") but did not complete all of them. Specifically, the user clicked on the "username" input field twice, but no entry was made and no "submit" action was taken for either. This suggests that the user may have had an intention to log in but did not follow through with providing the necessary credentials.

   1) [Step 1] The user navigated to the Restaurant Login page (indicated by the "click" event on the "Restaurant Login" link).
   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the username input field, indicating an intent to enter their username.
   3) [Step 3] The user did not enter any data into the username field and instead clicked on it again (possibly a mistake or change of mind), suggesting that they did not intend to continue with the login process.
   Note: Although the user did click on the password input field, no further action was taken there, which aligns with the decision of considering this session as a drop-off.

   All logs have been considered in making this decision.
