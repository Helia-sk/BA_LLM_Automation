 Tag: Conversion

   Reason: All initiated tasks in the session were completed. The user clicked on the "Add Item" button, which indicates that they intended to add an item to the menu. They then navigated to the section where they could upload images and click on it, suggesting they wanted to add an image for the item. Although the specific action of uploading an image is not shown in the logs, the user's interaction with the "Add Item" button implies that they intended to complete this task.

   1) The user opened the menu dashboard page (/restaurant/dashboard/menu).
   2) The user clicked on the "Add Item" button.
   3) The user navigated to the section where they could upload an image for the item.
   4) Although not explicitly shown in the logs, it is implied that the user attempted to upload an image for the item based on their interaction with the "Add Item" button.

   I have considered all the logs provided as they show the user's interactions with various elements on the menu dashboard page and their actions suggest that they intended to add an item to the menu, which is a completed task.
