==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off

   Reason: The user initiated a task by clicking on "History" in the dashboard, but subsequently clicked on "View Details" for an item in the history. However, after viewing the details, the user did not complete any further tasks such as submitting a form or making a purchase. Instead, the user clicked on the "Reject" button, which is typically associated with abandoning a task, and then left the page by closing it.

   1) [Step 1] The user navigated to the restaurant dashboard (/restaurant/dashboard).
   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "History" link in the dashboard.
   3) [Step 3] The user viewed a specific item's details by clicking on the "View Details" button for that item.
   4) [Step 4] The user clicked on the "Reject" button, possibly indicating rejection of the item or the task associated with it.
   5) [Step 5] The user left the page (/restaurant/dashboard/history) by closing it.

   I have considered all the logs provided in making this decision. The user did not complete any tasks beyond viewing the details, which is typically a sign of drop-off behavior.
