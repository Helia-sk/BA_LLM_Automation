 Tag: Conversion
   Reason: The user initiated a task (clicking on the "Customer Login" link) and completed it by entering their username ("User1") twice, once for the input_change event with debounced_input trigger and again for the final input_change event without a specific id. This indicates that the user successfully logged in to the customer portal, which can be considered as completing the intended task.
