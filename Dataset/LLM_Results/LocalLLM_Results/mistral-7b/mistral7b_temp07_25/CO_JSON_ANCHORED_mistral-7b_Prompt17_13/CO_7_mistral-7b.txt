==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user initiated the task of clicking on the "Customer Login" link, but did not complete the subsequent steps such as entering a username and password. The user also clicked on other elements in the form, indicating potential engagement, but did not actually submit the form.

   1) [Step 1] User navigated to the homepage (url: "http://localhost:5173/").
   2) [Step 2] User clicked on the "Customer Login" link located at x = 633, y = 35.
   3) [Step 3] User clicked on the input field for the username (id: "username").
   4) [Step 4] User clicked on the input field for the password (not provided in the log).
   5) [Step 5] The user did not submit the form (no "submit" event was recorded).
   The log file does not provide enough information to determine if the user navigated away from the page or simply left the application, but based on the lack of a completed task, we can classify this session as a drop-off.
