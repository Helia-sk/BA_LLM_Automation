 Tag: Conversion

   Reason: The user initiated a task (clicking on the "Restaurant PartnersRegister your restaurant or log in to manage orders") and then performed two tasks related to login (entering username and clicking on the username input field, entering password and clicking on the password input field). After that, the user performed another task by clicking on the "Sign In" button which indicates a successful login. Therefore, all initiated tasks were completed, so we can tag this session as a conversion.

   1) The user landed on the Restaurant Partners page (we don't have specific log for this step but it's implied).
   2) The user clicked on the "Restaurant PartnersRegister your restaurant or log in to manage orders" link.
   3) The user navigated to the login page (implied by the next events).
   4) The user entered their username in the username input field.
   5) The user clicked on the username input field to activate it.
   6) The user entered their password in the password input field.
   7) The user clicked on the password input field to activate it.
