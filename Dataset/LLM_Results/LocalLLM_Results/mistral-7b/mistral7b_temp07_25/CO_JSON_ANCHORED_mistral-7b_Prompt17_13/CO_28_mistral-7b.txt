==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user initiated a task (login) but did not complete it, as indicated by the "form_submit" event. However, the user subsequently performed an input change on the password field, suggesting that they may have been filling out the form, but this was followed by no further actions related to the login process.

  1) [Step 1] The user navigated to the login page of the restaurant website (indicated by the URL "/restaurant/login").
  2) [Step 2] The user entered their username or password in the respective fields, as indicated by the "input_change" event.
  3) [Step 3] The user attempted to submit the login form by clicking the "Sign In" button (indicated by the "click" event).
  4) [Step 4] The user did not complete the login process, as there are no subsequent events related to the login after this step.
  5) [Step 5] The user navigated to another page on the website (indicated by the URL change to "/restaurant/login") and performed an input change on the password field again, but did not complete any further actions.

All initiated tasks were not completed, so the session was a drop-off. It's important to note that the logs do not provide information about why the user may have abandoned the login process, such as encountering an error or losing interest. To gain more insight into user behavior, it would be beneficial to analyze additional data points, like user demographics and device type, if available.
