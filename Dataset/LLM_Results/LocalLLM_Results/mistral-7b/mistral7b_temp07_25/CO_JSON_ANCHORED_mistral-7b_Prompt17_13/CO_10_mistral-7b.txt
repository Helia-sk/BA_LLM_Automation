 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user initially clicked on "Balance", but did not complete any further tasks related to the balance section, such as viewing the balance details. Later, the user navigated to the "Orders" section, and although they viewed the orders, they did not proceed to view order details or perform any other actions in that section. The user then clicked on "View Details" under the "Orders" section, but it appears there was no corresponding log for this action being completed, indicating that the user may have abandoned this task as well. Since all initiated tasks were not completed, the session is classified as a drop-off.

   Here's the user journey step-by-step:
   1) The user clicked on "Balance" to view their balance information.
   2) The user navigated to the "Orders" section by clicking on the "Orders" link.
   3) The user viewed the orders list in the Orders section.
   4) The user clicked on the "View Details" button under one of the orders, but did not complete this task as there is no subsequent log indicating successful completion.
   Since the initiated task (viewing order details) was abandoned, the session is classified as a drop-off. It's important to note that all logs were considered in making this decision.
