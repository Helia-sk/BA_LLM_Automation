==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user initiated a task (clicking on the "Customer Login" link) but did not complete it by entering any information in the username field. This suggests that the session was abandoned before completion of the intended action.

   1) [Step 1] The user navigated to the website and clicked on the "Customer Login" link.
   2) [Step 2] After clicking the "Customer Login" link, the user's cursor moved to the username input field, but no text was entered.
   3) [Step 3] There is no further interaction recorded in the log file that indicates the user completed the login process or any other initiated tasks.

   It should be noted that while the user did click on the password input field, no data suggests that a password was entered or that the login attempt was completed. The session appears to have been abandoned after the initial step of clicking the "Customer Login" link. All logs in the file were considered in this analysis.
