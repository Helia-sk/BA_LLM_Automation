==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: One of the initiated tasks (View Details) was abandoned, indicating that the user did not complete all tasks.

   1) [Step 1] The user visited the restaurant dashboard page ("/restaurant/dashboard/history") at "2025-09-14T07:45:51.066Z".
   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "History" link ("flex items-center px-3 py-2 rounded-md text-sm font-medium whitespace-nowrap bg-orange-500 text-white") at "2025-09-14T07:45:51.066Z".
   3) [Step 3] The user clicked on the "View Details" button ("bg-orange-500 text-white px-4 py-2 rounded hover:bg-orange-600") at "2025-09-14T07:46:01.979Z". However, this action was followed by a click on the "X" button ("text-red-500 hover:text-red-700 absolute top-2 right-2") at "2025-09-14T07:46:03.781Z", which suggests that the user decided not to view the details, indicating an incomplete action.
   4) [Step 4] The user closed the popup by clicking on the "X" button ("text-red-500 hover:text-red-700 absolute top-2 right-2") at "2025-09-14T07:46:03.781Z".
   5) [Step 5] The user closed the session by clicking on the "X" button ("text-red-500 hover:text-red-700 absolute top-2 right-2") at "2025-09-14T07:46:03.781Z".
   Note: All logs were considered in the decision making process. The user did not complete all initiated tasks, hence the session was a drop-off.
