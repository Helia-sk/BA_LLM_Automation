 Tag: Drop-Off

   Reason: The user initiated the task of clicking on the "Customer Login" link, but did not complete the following tasks such as filling out the username and password fields. This indicates that the session was abandoned before completion.

   1) [Step 1] The user accessed the homepage (URL: http://localhost:5173/).
   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "Customer Login" link located at x=633, y=35.
   3) [Step 3] The user moved the cursor over the username input field and clicked on it (x=451, y=310).
   4) [Step 4] The user did not enter any data into the username field.
   5) [Step 5] The user did not click on the password input field or enter any data.
   6) [Step 6] The user did not submit the form by clicking on the submit button.
   Considering all the logs, it is clear that the user abandoned the session before completing the task of logging in, hence the tag "Drop-Off".
