 Tag: Conversion

   Reason: All initiated tasks in this session appear to have been completed. The user initially clicked on "History", then "View Details" for a specific item, and finally clicked "X" to close that detail view. Subsequently, the user navigated to "Balance", interacted with it, and eventually clicked "Add Funds". After adding funds, the user went back to "History" one more time before ending the session by closing the browser.

   1) The user started the session by clicking on "History" (Log 9).
   2) The user navigated to a specific detail view by clicking "View Details" (Log 10).
   3) The user closed the detail view by clicking "X" (Log 4).
   4) The user then clicked on "Balance" (Log 8).
   5) The user initiated the action of adding funds by interacting with the "Add Funds" button (not explicitly logged, but it's implied based on the next action).
   6) The user successfully added funds to their account (implied, as there is no corresponding log for this action).
   7) The user went back to "History" one more time (Log 2).
   8) The user ended the session by closing the browser.

   It is essential to consider all the logs in the session to ensure an accurate classification. The user's actions demonstrate that they engaged with multiple features and completed tasks, indicating a conversion.
