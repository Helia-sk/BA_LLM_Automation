 Tag: Conversion
   Reason: The user initiated a click on the "Customer Login" button and then interacted with the username input field, which indicates that they started the login process. After that, there was an interaction with the password input field, which is typically the next step in the login process. However, we do not have data about the user submitting their credentials or being authenticated. Since the user did not abandon any initiated tasks and there are no subsequent interactions suggesting otherwise, it can be assumed that the user successfully logged in, which would indicate a conversion.

  1) [Step 1] The user navigated to the "/customer/login" page from the "/restaurant/dashboard/settings" page.
  2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "Customer Login" button.
  3) [Step 3] The user interacted with the username input field, indicating they started the login process.
  4) [Step 4] The user also interacted with the password input field, which is the next step in the login process (although we don't have data about submitting credentials or being authenticated). However, since there are no subsequent interactions suggesting otherwise, it can be assumed that the user successfully logged in, indicating a conversion.
