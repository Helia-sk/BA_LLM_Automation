==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off

   Reason: The user initiated a task (clicking the "Add Item" button), but it seems that no further logs indicate completion of this task. As there is no evidence of the user returning to complete this task, it can be inferred that the session was dropped off.

   1) [Step 1] User navigated to the restaurant dashboard menu page (indicated by the first log).
   2) [Step 2] User clicked on the "Add Item" button (log_1758985597816_oylm25h53).
   3) [Step 3] User clicked somewhere within the menu items section, but no specific item was added (log_1758985597527_kl8ccdtia).
   4) [Step 4] User clicked on an image upload area or click-to-upload button, but there is no further indication of a file being uploaded or any other action related to adding an item (no logs after this step).
   It should be noted that the user navigated around the page and interacted with various elements, suggesting exploration, but none of these interactions led to completing the initiated task (adding an item), which indicates a drop-off.

   I have considered all the logs provided in my analysis.
