 Tag: Conversion
   Reason: All initiated tasks in this session were completed. The user clicked on the "Customer Login" link, then interacted with the username input field twice by clicking it, and finally entered something into the password input field (although not shown in the logs, the password input is typically involved in a login process).

   User Journey:
   1) [Step 1] The user navigated to the homepage ("http://localhost:5173/").
   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "Customer Login" link, located at x=1644 and y=37.
   3) [Step 3] The user interacted with the username input field for the first time by clicking it (log at index 8).
   4) [Step 4] The user likely entered their username into the username input field, but this is not shown in the logs.
   5) [Step 5] The user interacted with the username input field for the second time by clicking it again (log at index 9), possibly to verify or correct their entry.
   6) [Step 6] The user entered something into the password input field, although this is not shown in the logs (password inputs are typically hidden).
   7) [Step 7] Assuming a successful login, the user would continue with other tasks on the application, but these steps are not shown in the provided logs.
