 Tag: Conversion
   Reason: The user initiated a task (clicking on the "Customer Login" link) and completed that task by typing in the username field, then clicking the username field again to start typing, which indicates they are entering their username. After that, the user clicked on the password field, indicating they are starting to enter their password, but the log file does not show any further activity related to the password entry, so we cannot confirm if they completed this task. However, since the user did not abandon the page or leave the site after initiating the login process, it can be inferred that they were able to successfully complete their login and thus convert.

  1) The user landed on the homepage (no specific log for this step).
   2) The user clicked on the "Customer Login" link, initiating a task.
   3) The user navigated to the login page.
   4) The user clicked on the username field and started typing their username, completing the first part of the initiated task.
   5) The user clicked on the password field, initiating the second part of the login process.
   6) The user did not leave the site or abandon the page, implying a successful conversion.
