 Tag: Conversion

   Reason: The user clicked on the "Customer Login" link, which initiated a session. After that, the user clicked on the form for the Username and Password input fields, implying that they were filling out the required information to log in. Since all the initiated tasks (clicking the login button, entering username, and password) were completed, this session can be classified as a conversion.

   1) The user clicked on the "Customer Login" link, initiating the session.
   2) The user clicked on the form for the Username input field.
   3) The user clicked on the form for the Password input field.
   4) The user clicked on the login button to submit the form and complete the login process.

   I have considered all the logs in my decision making, as the last action (clicking the login button) was completed by the user, indicating a successful login session.
