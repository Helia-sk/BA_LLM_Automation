 Tag: Drop-Off

   Reason: The user initially navigated to the "/customer/dashboard" page (Step 1), then scrolled through the page (Step 2). However, after this initial interaction, there is no further evidence of any tasks being initiated or completed. This suggests that the user did not engage in any actions that could be considered a conversion (such as clicking on a link to another page, filling out a form, etc.). Therefore, based on the available logs, it appears that the session was a drop-off.

   1) [Step 1] The user navigated to the "/customer/dashboard" page.
   2) [Step 2] The user scrolled through the page.
   3) No further steps could be determined from the provided logs as there is no evidence of any tasks being initiated or completed after the initial scroll event.
