==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: Although the user initiated multiple tasks, such as clicking on the "Restaurant Login", "Already have an account? Sign in", and interacting with the username input field, the user did not complete the final task of submitting the login form. This indicates that the session was abandoned, hence a drop-off.

   User Journey:
   1) [Step 1] The user clicked on the "Restaurant Login" link to initiate the login process.
   2) [Step 2] The user then clicked on the "Already have an account? Sign in" link, which typically indicates a user who already has an account but forgot their password or username.
   3) [Step 3] The user interacted with the username input field, suggesting they were attempting to enter their username for the login process. However, the user did not complete the login by submitting the form or entering the necessary information, thus resulting in a drop-off.
