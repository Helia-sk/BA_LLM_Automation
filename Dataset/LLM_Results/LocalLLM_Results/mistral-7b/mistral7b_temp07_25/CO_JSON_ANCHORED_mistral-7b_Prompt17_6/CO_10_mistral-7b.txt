 Tag: Conversion
   Reason: All initiated tasks in this session were completed. The user clicked on the "Balance" link, then the "Orders" link, and finally interacted with both the "View Details" button and the "Orders" button multiple times. Since all of these actions represent different tasks within the application, the session can be classified as a conversion.

   User Journey:
   1) [Step 1] The user clicked on the "Balance" link to view their account balance.
   2) [Step 2] The user then navigated to the "Orders" section by clicking on the corresponding link.
   3) [Step 3] The user interacted with the "View Details" button, indicating they wanted to see more information about one of their orders.
   4) [Step 4] The user continued to interact with the "Orders" button multiple times, suggesting they were reviewing or managing their orders in some way.
   Since all of these actions represent different tasks within the application and were completed by the user, this session can be considered a conversion.
