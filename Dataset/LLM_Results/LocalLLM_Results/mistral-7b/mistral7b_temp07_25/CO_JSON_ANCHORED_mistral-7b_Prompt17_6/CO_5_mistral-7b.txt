 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user initiated a task (clicking on "Customer Login") but did not complete it. The subsequent logs show that the user scrolled through the page and navigated to other parts of the site, but no further interaction with the "Customer Login" section was observed.

  1) [Step 1] User arrived at the homepage ("/").
  2) [Step 2] User navigated to the "Customer Login" page ("/customer/login") by clicking on the corresponding link.
  3) [Step 3] User scrolled down within the "Customer Login" page, but no further interaction with the login form was observed.
  4) [Step 4] User scrolled through other parts of the site and navigated to different pages, but no attempts were made to interact with the "Customer Login" section again.
  5) [Step 5] The session ended without completing the initiated task (logging in as a customer).

   All logs have been considered in this analysis. The user did not complete the initiated task of logging in, so the session is classified as a drop-off.
