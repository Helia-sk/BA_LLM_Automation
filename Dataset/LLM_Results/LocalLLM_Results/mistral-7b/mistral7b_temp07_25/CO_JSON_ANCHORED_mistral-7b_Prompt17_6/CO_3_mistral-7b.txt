==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user initiated a task by clicking on the "Restaurant Login" link, but did not complete the subsequent tasks of providing a username and password. Instead, the user closed the session after clicking on the username input field.

   1) [Step 1] The user navigated to the Restaurant Login page (log_id: log_1757772852515_uvv507x14).
   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the username input field (log_id: log_1757772853662_q9fok5nbl).
   3) [Step 3] The user did not enter any text in the username input field, indicating an intention to abandon the task. Instead, the user clicked outside of the field (log_id: log_1757772852515_uvv507x14).
   4) [Step 4] The user did not provide a password and did not click on the login button or any other links, signifying the end of the session (logs after this point do not indicate any further interaction with the login form).
   The decision was made based on the fact that all initiated tasks were not completed. In this case, since the user did not provide a username and password, which are essential steps in the login process, the session can be classified as a drop-off. It's important to note that all logs have been considered in making this decision.
