==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: Although the user clicked on the "Menu" link and navigated to the menu page, they did not complete any of the initiated tasks such as uploading an image, clicking the form submit button, or interacting with the input fields in the form. Therefore, this session can be classified as a drop-off.

   User Journey:
   1) [Step 1] The user landed on the restaurant dashboard page.
   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "Menu" link to navigate to the menu page.
   3) [Step 3] On the menu page, the user did not interact with any of the input fields or the form submit button, nor did they upload an image. Instead, they interacted with some other elements on the page such as an SVG element at x=664, y=338. However, these interactions do not constitute completed tasks.
   4) [Step 4] The user remained on the menu page without performing any actions that would indicate a conversion or completion of initiated tasks.
   Note: We consider all logs in making our decision. The logs show that the user did not complete any of the initiated tasks, which is the basis for classifying this session as a drop-off.
