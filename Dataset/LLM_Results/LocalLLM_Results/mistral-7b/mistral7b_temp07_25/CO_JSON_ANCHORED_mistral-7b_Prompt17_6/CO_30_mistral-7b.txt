==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user initiated a task (View Details) but did not complete it, indicating that they abandoned the action.

   1) [Step 1] The session started with the user navigating to the restaurant dashboard page at http://localhost:5173/restaurant/dashboard from an unknown referrer.
   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "History" link located at x = 676, y = 126. This action initiated a task as the user was expected to view the history of the restaurant.
   3) [Step 3] The user then clicked on the "View Details" button for one of the history items, located at x = 1538, y = 298. This action represented another initiated task.
   4) [Step 4] However, the user did not complete the second task (Viewing Details), instead, they clicked on the "Reject" button, which is not shown in the logs provided. This indicates that they abandoned the task and possibly the session as well.
   Note: The logs do not show the "Reject" button or any subsequent actions after the "View Details" click, so it's impossible to confirm if the user left the site entirely or performed other actions that are not logged. However, since one of the initiated tasks was abandoned, the session is classified as a drop-off.
