==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user initiated a task (clicking on the "Menu" link to navigate to the menu page) but did not complete any other tasks that could be considered as part of a conversion. However, the user continued to interact with the website by scrolling and clicking within the menu page, which suggests they were still engaged but did not complete the conversion goal (e.g., placing an order).
   1) [Step 1] The user accessed the restaurant's dashboard.
   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "Menu" link to navigate to the menu page.
   3) [Step 3] The user scrolled through the menu page.
   It is important to note that this analysis assumes that placing an order is considered a conversion goal for the website. If other tasks, such as browsing items or contacting the restaurant, are also considered conversions, then the classification might change. However, in this log file, it does not appear that any other conversion-related tasks were initiated and completed.
