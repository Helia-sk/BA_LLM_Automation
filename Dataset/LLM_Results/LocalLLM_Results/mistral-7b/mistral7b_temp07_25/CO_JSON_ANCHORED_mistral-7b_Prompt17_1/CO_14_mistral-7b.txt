 Tag: Conversion

   Reason: All initiated tasks were completed. The user clicked on the "Customer Login" link, which led to the username input field. The user then entered a username ("User1"), and after that, clicked on the same username input field again, indicating that they may have intended to correct or modify their entry. However, since no further actions were taken after this, it is reasonable to assume that the user successfully logged in, which means all tasks initiated were completed.

   1) The user navigated to the customer login page by clicking on the "Customer Login" link. (Log: log_1758982001023_zzkgn108u)
