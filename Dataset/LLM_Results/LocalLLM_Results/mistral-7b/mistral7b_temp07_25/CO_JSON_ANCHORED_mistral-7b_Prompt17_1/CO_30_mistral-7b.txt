 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user initiated a task (clicking on "History") but did not complete it, instead they clicked on "Reject". This indicates that the user abandoned one of the initiated tasks.

   5) [Step 5] User clicked on the "Back" button to return to the restaurant dashboard page.
   6) [Step 6] User clicked on the "Details" button for a different order, but then clicked on the "Reject" button again.
   7) [Step 7] User clicked on the "History" link again at location (x, y): (676, 126).
   8) [Step 8] User clicked on the "Close" button to close the history pop-up.
   9) [Step 9] User clicked on the "X" button to close the notifications pop-up.
