==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user initiated a task (clicked on "Customer Login") but did not complete another initiated task (did not input any value in the username field). Therefore, the session was dropped off.

   Step 1) User clicked on the link to navigate to the Customer Login page.
   2) User clicked on the "Username" field.
   3) User clicked outside of the "Username" field without entering any value.
   4) The user did not complete the session by clicking the submit button or performing another action that would indicate a conversion.
   Notes: It is possible that the user intended to log in but decided against it or encountered an issue with the form. However, based on the provided logs, it cannot be determined for certain why the user did not proceed with the login process.
