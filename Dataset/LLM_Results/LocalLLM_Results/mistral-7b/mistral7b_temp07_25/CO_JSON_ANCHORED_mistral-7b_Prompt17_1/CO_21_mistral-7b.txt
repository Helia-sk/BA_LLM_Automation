 Tag: Conversion

   Reason: The session can be classified as a conversion because all initiated tasks were completed. The user first navigated to the homepage, then clicked on the "Restaurant Partners" link, which led them to the login/register page for restaurants. After that, they clicked on the "Register your restaurant" option, indicating their intent to register a new restaurant. Finally, they entered information and completed the registration process, as indicated by the subsequent logs showing interaction with the username and password fields.

   1) The user initiated the session by navigating to the homepage (http://localhost:5173/).
   2) The user clicked on the "Restaurant Partners" link, which led them to the login/register page for restaurants (http://localhost:5173/restaurant/login).
   3) The user decided to register a new restaurant, rather than logging in.
   4) The user entered their registration details and completed the registration process.
   5) Finally, the user's session ended when they completed the registration process, as indicated by the last log showing no further activity on the site (http://localhost:5173/).

   It is important to note that all initiated tasks were completed in this session, making it a conversion. All logs have been considered in this decision-making process.
