==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: One of the initiated tasks was abandoned. The user clicked on the "Customer Login" link, but did not proceed to complete the login process or any other task that could be considered a conversion (such as filling out the username and password fields). Instead, the user navigated away from the login page without completing any further actions.

   User Journey:
   1) [Step 1] The user initiated a session by visiting the homepage ("/") of the application.
   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on a link to navigate to the "Customer Login" page.
   3) [Step 3] Upon reaching the login page, the user did not interact with any of the elements on the page, such as the username or password fields. Instead, they navigated away from the login page without completing the login process or any other task that could be considered a conversion.
   Note: The log file does not provide enough information to determine if the user visited any other pages or performed any other actions after navigating away from the login page. However, since there is no evidence of further interactions that could be considered part of a conversion, it is reasonable to classify this session as a drop-off based on the information provided in the log file.
