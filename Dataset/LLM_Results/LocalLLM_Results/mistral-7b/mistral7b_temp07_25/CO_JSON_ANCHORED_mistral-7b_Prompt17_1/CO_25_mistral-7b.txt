==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user initiated a task (clicking on the "Menu" button to navigate to the menu page) but did not complete any further tasks such as scrolling down the menu page or clicking on any item from the menu. The session ended without any further interaction, indicating that the user dropped off before completing the intended action.

  1) [Step 1] User accessed the restaurant's dashboard.
  2) [Step 2] User clicked on the "Menu" button to navigate to the menu page.
  3) [Step 3] User scrolled the menu page (indicated by a scroll event), but did not click on any item from the menu, which suggests that they didn't find what they were looking for or had no interest in proceeding further with the action.
  4) [Step 4] The session ended without any further interaction, indicating a drop-off.

   In this log file, all initiated tasks (scroll and click events) were not completed, so the session was classified as a drop-off. It is important to consider every logged event in the analysis of user behavior to accurately determine conversion or drop-off status.
