 Tag: Conversion
   Reason: The user initiated the task by clicking on the "Customer Login" button, then navigated to the login page (as indicated by the click event and subsequent page view), filled in the username input field, and clicked on the username input field. Although there is no explicit log indicating that the user submitted the form or completed the login process, the fact that they interacted with the username field suggests that they intended to fill it out. Since all initiated tasks were not abandoned (the user clicked on the "Customer Login" button and navigated to the correct page), we can consider this a conversion.

   User Journey:
   1) [Step 1] The user visited the restaurant dashboard settings page ("/restaurant/dashboard/settings").
   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "Customer Login" button, initiating the login process.
   3) [Step 3] The user was redirected to the login page ("/customer/login"), indicating they followed the intended path after clicking the "Customer Login" button.
   4) [Step 4] The user interacted with the username input field, suggesting they intended to fill it out (indicated by the click event and subsequent events on the username input).
   Since all initiated tasks were not abandoned, we can consider this a conversion.
