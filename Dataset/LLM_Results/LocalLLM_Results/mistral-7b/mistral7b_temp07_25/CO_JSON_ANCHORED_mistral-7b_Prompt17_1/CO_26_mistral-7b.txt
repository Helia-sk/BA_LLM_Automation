==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: One of the initiated tasks (Add Item) was abandoned, as it was clicked but no further logs related to completing this task were observed.
   1) [Step 1] The user navigated to the restaurant dashboard menu page ("/restaurant/dashboard/menu").
   2) [Step 2] The user scrolled down the menu items and interacted with various items (click events on "Saladmixvery healthy", "best dessert ever", "Super sweet", "MojitoSuper Minti").
   3) [Step 3] The user clicked on the "Add Item" button, but no further logs related to actually adding an item were observed.
   Additionally, although the user clicked on the "Drag image here or click to upload" area multiple times, it's unclear if this was a part of the initiated task (adding an item), as there were no subsequent logs indicating that the user successfully added an image or completed this action.
   Considered all the logs to the end and made a decision based on the information provided.
