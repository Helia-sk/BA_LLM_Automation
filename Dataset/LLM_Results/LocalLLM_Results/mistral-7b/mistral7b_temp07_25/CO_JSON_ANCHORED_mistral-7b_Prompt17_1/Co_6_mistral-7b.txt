==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user clicked on the "Customer Login" link, which indicates an initiated task (Step 1). However, after clicking on the login form and input field for username, there is no subsequent log indicating that the user has entered a username or password and submitted the form. Therefore, since not all initiated tasks were completed, we classify this session as a drop-off.

   User Journey:
   1) [Step 1] The user navigated to the customer login page (indicated by clicking on the "Customer Login" link).
   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the login form and input field for username (indicated by the click event on the input field).
   3) [Step 3] No subsequent logs indicate that the user entered a username or password, nor submitted the form. Therefore, the session ended without completion of the login process.

   Note: All logs have been considered in this analysis.
