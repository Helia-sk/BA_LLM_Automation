==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user initiated a task by clicking on "History" (log 10), but did not complete any subsequent tasks related to viewing details or navigating further into the history. Instead, they clicked on the "X" button (log 9) which is typically used for closing or canceling actions, suggesting that they may have decided to leave the page without completing their intended action.

   User Journey:
   1) The user visited the restaurant dashboard page (implied from the context).
   2) The user clicked on the "History" link to navigate to the history section (log 10).
   3) The user clicked on the "X" button, which is typically used for closing or canceling actions, suggesting that they may have decided to leave the page without completing their intended action in the history section.

   All initiated tasks were not completed, hence the session was classified as a drop-off. It's important to note that all logs were considered in this decision.
