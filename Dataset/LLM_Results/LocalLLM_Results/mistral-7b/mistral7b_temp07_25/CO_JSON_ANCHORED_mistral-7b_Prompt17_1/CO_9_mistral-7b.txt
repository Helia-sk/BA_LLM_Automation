 Tag: Conversion
   Reason: All initiated tasks in the session were completed. The user first scrolled through a restaurant page, then clicked on the "No image available" div, indicating they might have been interested in the restaurant but didn't find an image appealing. After that, the user navigated to the dashboard and scrolled again. However, this could be due to the user checking other information or looking for more restaurants. Subsequently, the user clicked on the "Restaurants" option in the dashboard, indicating they were still engaged with the platform. Finally, the user clicked on a restaurant (the fifth log), which was the last initiated action and was also completed, making this a conversion session.

  1) The user initially scrolled through a restaurant page (first log).
  2) The user clicked on the "No image available" div in the same restaurant page (second log).
  3) The user navigated to the dashboard and scrolled again (third log).
  4) The user clicked on the "Restaurants" option in the dashboard (fourth log).
  5) The user clicked on a specific restaurant, completing all initiated tasks and marking this as a conversion session.

   I have considered all the logs to the end to make an informed decision.
