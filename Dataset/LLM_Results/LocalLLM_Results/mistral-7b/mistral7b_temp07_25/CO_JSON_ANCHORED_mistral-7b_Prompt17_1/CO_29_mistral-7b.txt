   Reason: Although the user initiated some tasks such as clicking on "History", "View Details", and "X", they did not complete all the initiated tasks.

Additionally, the user returned to the "History" section, indicating potential interest, but did not click on "Add to Cart" or proceed to checkout, which are crucial steps in a conversion.
