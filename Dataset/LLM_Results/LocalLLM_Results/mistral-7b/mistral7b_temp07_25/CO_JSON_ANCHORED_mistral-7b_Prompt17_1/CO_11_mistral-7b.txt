==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off

   Reason: The user did not complete the intended action (visiting the specific page "/customer/dashboard/<some_id>"), which was initiated in the first log. Instead, the user navigated away from that page and moved to another page ("/customer/dashboard") multiple times before leaving the application, as indicated by the subsequent logs.

   1) [Step 1] User started a new session (log with "session_id" field).
   2) [Step 2] User navigated to "/customer/dashboard" page (first log).
   3) [Step 3] User scrolled down the page and then back up, indicating an exploration of the content (second log).
   4) [Step 4] User scrolled further down the page (third log).
   5) [Step 5] User scrolled back to the top again (fourth log).
   6) [Step 6] User left the "/customer/dashboard" page and navigated to "/customer/dashboard/<some_id>" page, presumably with an intent to complete a task (first log after the initial one).
   7) [Step 7] User did not complete the task on the new page and instead returned to the "/customer/dashboard" page, indicating a change in behavior or intention (second log after the fifth one).
   8) [Step 8] User navigated away from the application, as indicated by the absence of any further logs.
