 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: One of the initiated tasks (Customer Login) was performed but not followed by a completed task indicating that the user didn't proceed further, which suggests a drop-off.

   1) [Step 1] The user navigated from "/restaurant/dashboard/settings" to the homepage ("http://localhost:5173/").
   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "Customer Login" link, indicating an intention to log in.
   3) [Step 3] The user clicked on the username input field but did not perform any further action related to entering credentials or submitting the form.
   4) [Step 4] The user clicked away from the username input field, suggesting that they might have decided against logging in at this point.
   Considering all the logs provided, it appears that the user initiated a task (Customer Login) but did not complete it, which leads to the classification of this session as a drop-off.
