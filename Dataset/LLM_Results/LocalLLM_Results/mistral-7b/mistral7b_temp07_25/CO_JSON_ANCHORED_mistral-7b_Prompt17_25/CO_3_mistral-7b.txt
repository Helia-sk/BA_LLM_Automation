 Tag: Drop-Off

   Reason: Although the user initiated the task of navigating to the login page for the restaurant (log 5), they did not complete the subsequent tasks of entering their username and password (logs 6, 7). Instead, they left the page after clicking on an element within the page (log 8). Since one of the initiated tasks was abandoned, we classify this session as a drop-off.

   1) [Step 1] The user accessed the Restaurant Login page (log 5).
   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on an input field to enter their username (implied from log 6, but not explicitly shown in any log).
   3) [Step 3] The user entered "User1" as their username (implicitly shown in logs 6 and 7).
   4) [Step 4] The user did not proceed to enter their password. Instead, they clicked on an element within the page (log 8), which could indicate that they navigated away from the page or took some other action without completing the login process.
