==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off

   Reason: While the user initially clicked on the "Menu" link (step 1), further initiated tasks such as uploading an image, filling out the form for a category, and changing the order of items were not completed. Since all initiated tasks were not finished, the session can be classified as a drop-off.

   1) [Step 1] The user navigated to the "Menu" page (as indicated by clicking on the "Menu" link).
   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "ImageDrag image here or click to upload" area, which could be considered an attempt to upload an image. However, no log shows that an actual image was uploaded.
   3) [Step 3] The user interacted with the form for adding a new category (Starters, Main Courses, Desserts, Drinks, Side Dishes), but no submission or save action was performed, indicating that the form was not filled out and submitted.
   4) [Step 4] The user clicked on different elements within the form, suggesting that they were exploring the page and considering adding new items, but none of these actions resulted in a completed task.
   5) [Step 5] The user did not take any further actions, indicating that the session was abandoned without completing any initiated tasks.

   It is essential to review all logs to ensure that no important interactions were missed. In this case, it appears that the user's interaction with the page was limited, and they did not complete any of the initiated tasks, resulting in a drop-off.
