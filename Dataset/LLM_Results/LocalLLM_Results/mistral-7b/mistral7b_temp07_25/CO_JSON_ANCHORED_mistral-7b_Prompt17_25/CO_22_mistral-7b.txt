 Tag: Conversion
   Reason: All initiated tasks were completed. The user clicked on the link to navigate to the login page, entered a username ("User1"), clicked on the submit button for password input (implicitly as there is no corresponding log), and then clicked the "Sign In" button to complete the login process.

  1) [Step 1] User navigated to the Restaurant Partners page by clicking the link.
  2) [Step 2] User initiated a login by clicking on the "Log in" button.
  3) [Step 3] User entered their username ("User1") and clicked on the submit button for password input (implicitly as there is no corresponding log).
  4) [Step 4] User entered their password and clicked the "Sign In" button to complete the login process.

   I have considered all the logs in my decision making, as all initiated tasks were completed by the user, hence tagging this as a conversion.
