 Tag: Conversion

   Reason: All initiated tasks in the session were completed. The user first navigated to the restaurant dashboard settings page (indicating an active session), then clicked on the "Customer Login" link, which led to the login page where no interaction was recorded, suggesting that the user may have already been logged in or chose not to interact with the login form. Subsequently, the user clicked on the username input field and the password field, indicating an attempt to fill out the login form, but no further interaction was recorded after this, suggesting that the user may have submitted the form without issues. Finally, the user navigated away from the restaurant dashboard settings page and landed on the home page, which is typically the last step in a conversion process for a customer login session.

   1) The user navigated to the restaurant dashboard settings page (indicating an active session). [Reason: Initial interaction with the application.]
