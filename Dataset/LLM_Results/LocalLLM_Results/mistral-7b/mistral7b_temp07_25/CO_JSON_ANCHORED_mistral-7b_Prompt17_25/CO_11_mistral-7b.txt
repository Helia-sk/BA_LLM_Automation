 Tag: Drop-Off

   Reason: The user initiated tasks by scrolling through the webpage, but it appears that they did not complete any of the tasks (such as clicking on a specific link or submitting a form). After scrolling to different sections of the page, they left the session without taking any further actions.

   1) [Step 1] The user opened the webpage at '/customer/dashboard' (log with attempt_id "log_1757774276450_fntdti8qo").
   2) [Step 2] The user scrolled down the page to section '310.3999938964844' (log with attempt_id "log_1757774274528_gt98ftf43").
   3) [Step 3] The user continued scrolling down the page to section '1348.800048828125' (log with attempt_id "log_1757774275386_7sjdieux2").
   4) [Step 4] The user scrolled down further to section '2044' (implied from the log with attempt_id "log_1757774275386_7sjdieux2", since scrollY is greater than the page height).
   5) [Step 5] The user scrolled back up to section '1348.800048828125' (log with attempt_id "log_1757774274528_gt98ftf43" scrollY is less than the previous log, indicating scrolling up).
   6) [Step 6] The user scrolled down to section '0' (implied from the log with attempt_id "log_1757774276450_fntdti8qo", since scrollY is zero and it is the first entry in the session).
   7) [Step 7] The user scrolled up to section '310.3999938964844' (log with attempt_id "log_1757774274528_gt98ftf43" scrollY is greater than the previous log, indicating scrolling down).
   8) [Step 8] The user scrolled up to section '0' (implied from the log with attempt_id "log_1757774276450_fntdti8qo", since scrollY is zero and it is the last entry in the session).
   9) [Step 9] The user left the session without taking any further actions.
