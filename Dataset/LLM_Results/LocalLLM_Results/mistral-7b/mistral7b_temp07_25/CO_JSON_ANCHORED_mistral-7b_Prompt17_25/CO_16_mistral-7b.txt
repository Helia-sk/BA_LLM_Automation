 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user did not complete the task of entering a username (initiated with the click event on the username input field) or password (no corresponding click event found in the log file). This indicates that the user abandoned the task before completing it, which classifies this session as a drop-off.

  1) [Step 1] The user navigated to the customer login page ("Customer Login" button clicked).
  2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the username input field but did not enter any data.
  3) [Step 3] No corresponding click event for the password input field was found, indicating that the user did not enter a password.
  4) [Step 4] The user did not submit the form or perform any other actions in the session that could be considered completion of the login process.

After reviewing all the logs, it is important to note that the user initiated the task of logging in but did not complete it, which classifies this session as a drop-off.
