 Tag: Conversion
   Reason: All initiated tasks in the log file were completed. The user initially clicked on the "Menu" link, scrolled down the page, and then interacted with an element (possibly a button) to navigate to the "/restaurant/dashboard/menu" page, which is a conversion action in the context of this application.

  1) [Step 1] The user accessed the web application with version "web-1.4.2".
  2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "Menu" link to navigate to the menu section.
  3) [Step 3] The user scrolled down the page, indicating that they were exploring the menu options.
  4) [Step 4] The user interacted with an element (possibly a button) on the menu page, which triggered navigation to the "/restaurant/dashboard/menu" page, signifying a successful conversion action.

I have considered all the logs provided in making this decision.
