 Tag: Drop-Off

   Reason: The user initially navigated to the "/restaurant/dashboard" page (log 10), then clicked on the "History" link (log 9) which indicated an initiated task. However, the user did not complete any other tasks related to viewing or interacting with the history details, instead opted to go back to the dashboard by clicking the "View Details" button (log 8). The user then clicked on a button labeled "Reject" (not shown in logs) which signaled the abandonment of another initiated task. This sequence indicates that the session was a drop-off as not all initiated tasks were completed.

   1) [Step 1] User navigated to the restaurant dashboard page.
   2) [Step 2] User clicked on the "History" link to initiate a task.
   3) [Step 3] User clicked on the "View Details" button, indicating an intention to view details of a history item but did not complete this task.
   4) [Step 4] User clicked on the "Reject" button, abandoning another initiated task and ultimately resulting in a drop-off session.
