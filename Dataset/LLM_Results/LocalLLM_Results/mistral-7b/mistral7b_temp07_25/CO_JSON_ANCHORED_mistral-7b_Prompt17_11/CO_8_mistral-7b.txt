 Tag: Drop-Off

   Reason: Although the user initiated the "Customer Login" action, they did not proceed to fill out the username or password fields. This indicates that they abandoned the login process before completing it, which classifies this session as a drop-off.

   1) [Step 1] User navigated to the customer login page by clicking on the "Customer Login" link.
   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the username field but did not interact with it further, suggesting they might have intended to enter their username.
   3) [Step 3] Similarly, the user clicked on the password field without providing any input, indicating they may have intended to enter their password as well. However, since no typing or password submission was observed, we can assume that the user abandoned the login process at this point.
   Note: All logs were considered in this analysis, and it was determined that the user did not complete all initiated tasks (login), making this a drop-off session.
