==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user initiated a task (clicking on the "Customer Login" link) but did not complete it. Instead, they abandoned the session after clicking on the input field for username and password. No further actions indicating completion of the login process were recorded in the logs.

   1) [Step 1] User navigated from the restaurant dashboard settings to the homepage (/).
   2) [Step 2] User clicked on the "Customer Login" link located at the top right corner of the page.
   3) [Step 3] User clicked on the input field for username.
   However, no further actions were recorded in the logs indicating completion of the login process, which suggests that the user abandoned the session after initiating the task. Therefore, this session was a drop-off.

Please note that I have considered all the logs provided in my decision making and analysis of the user journey.
