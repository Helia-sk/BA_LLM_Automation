 Tag: Drop-Off

   Reason: While the user initiated a task (signing in to the system), they did not complete it. The initiated task was abandoned after entering the username and password, as indicated by the "form_submit" event. However, this decision is based on the logs provided, and further analysis of subsequent logs might provide additional information that could alter this classification.

   1) [Step 1] User accessed the login page for the restaurant app (indicated by the first log).
   2) [Step 2] The user entered their username (username_length: 0, inputName: "username").
   3) [Step 3] The user entered their password (password_length: 0, inputName: "password").
   4) [Step 4] The user submitted the login form (event_name: "form_submit"). However, no subsequent logs indicate a successful sign-in or completion of any tasks on the dashboard.

   Further analysis is required to confirm this decision and understand if there were any technical issues, user errors, or other factors that caused the drop-off. It's essential to examine additional logs for more context about the user's behavior and possible reasons for abandoning the session.
