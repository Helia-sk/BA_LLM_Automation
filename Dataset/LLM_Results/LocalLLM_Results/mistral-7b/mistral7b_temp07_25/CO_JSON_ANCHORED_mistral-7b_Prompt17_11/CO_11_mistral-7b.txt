==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off

   Reason: The user initially navigated to the customer dashboard page (Step 1), but after scrolling, they didn't initiate any tasks that could be considered as conversion events. Instead, they scrolled through the page multiple times and left without interacting with any clickable elements or filling out forms. Therefore, based on the lack of completed tasks, this session appears to be a drop-off.

   1) [Step 1] User navigated to the customer dashboard page (/customer/dashboard).
   2) [Step 2] User scrolled through the page multiple times without interacting with any clickable elements or filling out forms.
   3) [Step 3] User left the website without completing any tasks that could be considered as conversion events.

   I have considered all the logs provided to make this decision, and there are no indications of initiated tasks being completed, which is why it has been classified as a drop-off session.
