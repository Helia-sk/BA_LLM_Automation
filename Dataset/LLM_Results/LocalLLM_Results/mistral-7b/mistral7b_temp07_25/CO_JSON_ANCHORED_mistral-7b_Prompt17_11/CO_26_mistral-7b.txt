 Tag: Conversion
   Reason: The user initiated the task of adding an item to the menu (Step 5) and successfully completed it by clicking the "Add Item" button. Although the user did not complete other tasks such as uploading an image or selecting a category, these were not explicitly required for adding an item, so they do not impact the conversion status.

   User Journey:
   1) [Step 1] The user navigated to the restaurant dashboard menu page (Log 1).
   2) [Step 2] The user scrolled down the menu items and clicked on "Add Item" (Log 5).
   3) [Step 3] The user navigated back to the section where they could upload an image or select a category, but did not complete this task.
   4) [Step 4] The user may have intended to provide more details for the item they added, but the log does not show whether they completed this step.
   5) [Step 5] The user successfully clicked on the "Add Item" button (Log 5), which added the item to the menu.
   After analyzing all logs, it is clear that the user initiated and completed the task of adding an item to the menu, so the session was a conversion.
