   Reason: All initiated tasks in this session were completed. The user started on the restaurant page (session_1757771443548_7eqjj0e9b), scrolled down the page, interacted with an image (click event at log_1757773978615_bwt5ki2v4), and then clicked on the "Restaurant" button (log_1757773977591_3etisigwv). This action led to a new page (session_1757771443548_7eqjj0e9b), where the user scrolled again, interacted with another image (log_1757773978615_bwt5ki2v4), and finally clicked on the "Restaurant" button (log_1757773977591_3etisigwv). This action led back to the same page, where the user scrolled again (log_1757773978718_dw1dc2kpq) and then clicked on the "Restaurant" button for a third time (log_1757773977591_3etisigwv), which led to a new page.
