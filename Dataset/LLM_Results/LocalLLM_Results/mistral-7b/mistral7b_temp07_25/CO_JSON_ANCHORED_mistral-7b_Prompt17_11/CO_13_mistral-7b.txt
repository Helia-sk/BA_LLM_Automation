   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "History" link to navigate to the history section.
   3) [Step 3] The user clicked on the "View Details" button for a specific entry in the history, but subsequently did not complete any further actions related to that entry (like clicking on the X button or the "View More" button), suggesting they left the page without completing their intended action.
