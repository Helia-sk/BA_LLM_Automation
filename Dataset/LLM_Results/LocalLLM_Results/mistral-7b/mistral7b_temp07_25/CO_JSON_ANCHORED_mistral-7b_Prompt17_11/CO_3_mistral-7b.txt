==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user initiated the task of logging in to the Restaurant, but abandoned it after clicking on the username input field without entering any information. This indicates that the user did not complete the intended action (providing their username and password), suggesting a drop-off.

  1) [Step 1] The user navigated to the Restaurant Login page by clicking on the "Restaurant Login" link.
  2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the username input field, indicating they were about to enter their username. However, they did not complete this action and instead abandoned it.
  3) [Step 3] The user did not interact with any other elements on the page after clicking on the username input field, suggesting that they left the page without attempting to log in.

   All initiated tasks were not completed, so the session was a drop-off. It is important to note that this analysis does not consider potential future actions or user behavior outside of the provided logs.
