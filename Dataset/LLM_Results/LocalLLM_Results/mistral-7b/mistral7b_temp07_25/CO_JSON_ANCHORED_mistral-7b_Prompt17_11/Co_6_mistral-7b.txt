 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: While there were initiated tasks such as clicking on the "Customer Login" button, it appears that one of the subsequent tasks (entering a username in the input field) was not completed. This suggests that the user may have abandoned the process before completing it.

   User Journey Step-by-step:
   1) [Step 1] The user clicked on the link to navigate to the "/customer/login" page.
   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "Customer Login" button, indicating an intent to start the login process.
   3) [Step 3] The user initiated a click event on the username input field but did not complete the task of entering a username. This suggests that the user may have abandoned the process at this point, resulting in a drop-off.
