 Tag: Conversion

   Reason: The user initiated the task (clicking on the "Hungry? Order delicious food from local restaurants" link) and then navigated back to the login form, implying that they intended to proceed with the login process. They subsequently clicked on the username and password fields, which are typically the next steps in a login process, and finally clicked the submit button on the form. Since all initiated tasks were completed, this session can be classified as a conversion.

   1) The user landed on the homepage ("Hungry? Order delicious food from local restaurants" link was clicked).
   2) The user navigated to the login page (a click event on the "Login" form was recorded).
   3) The user clicked on the username field.
   4) The user clicked on the password field.
   5) The user clicked the submit button on the login form, implying a successful login or an attempt at one.
   Considered all logs to the end.
