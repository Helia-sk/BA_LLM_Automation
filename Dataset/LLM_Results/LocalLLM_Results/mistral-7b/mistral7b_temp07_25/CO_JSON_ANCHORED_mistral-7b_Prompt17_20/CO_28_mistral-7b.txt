==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: Not all initiated tasks were completed. The user first performed a form_submit, but then the session shows several interactions related to filling out the password field (input_change and blur events), indicating that the user may have been trying to fill out the form, but did not complete it. No subsequent logs show a successful submission or navigation to the dashboard page, which suggests that the session was abandoned.

   User Journey:
   1) [Step 1] The user navigated to the login page of the restaurant application.
   2) [Step 2] The user entered their username (although this is not explicitly shown in the logs, it can be inferred as it is a required field).
   3) [Step 3] The user entered their password, but did not complete the form submission.
   4) [Step 4] The user interacted with the password input field multiple times, suggesting that they may have been trying to correct or verify their entry.
   (No subsequent logs show a successful submission or navigation to the dashboard page, so it appears that the session was abandoned.)
