 Tag: Drop-Off

   Reason: One of the initiated tasks was abandoned, specifically the user did not complete the form submission for adding a new menu item. While the user clicked on several elements and navigated through the page, they ultimately did not reach the final step of submitting the form, indicating that the session was incomplete.

   1) [Step 1] The user accessed the restaurant dashboard menu page (indicated by the first log).
   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "ImageDrag image here or click to upload" element (second log), suggesting they intended to upload an image for a new menu item.
   3) [Step 3] The user clicked on the form containing the details for the new menu item (third log).
   4) [Step 4] The user clicked outside of the form, which may have been an accidental click (fourth log). However, no further interaction with the form was observed, indicating that the user did not complete the submission.
   5) [Step 5] The user clicked on various elements within the page but did not interact with the form again (fifth to eighth logs).

   It appears all initiated tasks were considered in this analysis. The user did not complete the final step of submitting the form, which indicates a drop-off session.
