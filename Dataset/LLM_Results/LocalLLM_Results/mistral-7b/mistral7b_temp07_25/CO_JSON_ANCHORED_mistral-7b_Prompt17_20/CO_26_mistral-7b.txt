==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: Although the user clicked on the "Add Item" button, they did not complete any other tasks initiated in the session. Specifically, the user did not input any item details, such as name, price, or image, which are essential steps for adding a new menu item.

   Step 1) The user navigated to the restaurant dashboard menu page (URL: http://localhost:5173/restaurant/dashboard/menu).
   Step 2) The user clicked on the "Add Item" button, indicating they intended to add a new menu item.
   Step 3) The user did not perform any further actions related to adding a new menu item, such as inputting an item name, price, or image.
   Step 4) The user clicked on the drop-down list for menu categories (Starters, Main Courses, Desserts, Drinks, Side Dishes), suggesting they were considering which category to add their item under, but did not make a selection.
   Step 5) The user clicked on the "Drag image here or click to upload" area, possibly intending to upload an image for their new menu item, but did not proceed with the action.
   Step 6) The user did not perform any other tasks during this session, and ultimately left the page without completing the addition of a new menu item.

   In this log analysis, we considered all the logs provided. The user initiated the task of adding a new menu item by clicking on the "Add Item" button, but they did not complete any subsequent steps required for that task. Therefore, the session can be classified as a drop-off because one of the initiated tasks was abandoned.
