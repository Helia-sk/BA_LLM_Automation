==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user initiated the task of clicking on the "Customer Login" link, but did not complete the subsequent tasks such as entering a username and password. Instead, they navigated away from the login page without performing these actions.

1) [Step 1] User landed on the homepage of the website ("http://localhost:5173/customer/login").
2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "Customer Login" link located at x = 627, y = 38.
3) [Step 3] The user clicked on the username input field, but did not enter any information.
4) [Step 4] The user clicked away from the login page without entering a password or submitting the form.
5) [Step 5] No subsequent actions were observed in the log file indicating that the user did not complete any further tasks on the website.

I have considered all the logs to the end and based on the provided conditions, since one of the initiated tasks (entering a username and password) was abandoned, the session is classified as a drop-off.
