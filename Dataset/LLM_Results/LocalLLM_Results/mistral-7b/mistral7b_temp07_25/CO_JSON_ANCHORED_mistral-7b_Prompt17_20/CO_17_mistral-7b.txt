 Tag: Conversion

   Reason: The session started with the user navigating to the homepage ("/customer/dashboard"), then clicking on "Restaurants" link, which led them to the list of restaurants. From there, they selected a specific restaurant ("/customer/dashboard/restaurant/9"). After that, they interacted with some elements within that restaurant page (scrolled down and clicked on an image), indicating interest. Finally, they performed a conversion action by clicking on the "Add to Cart" button for that restaurant, which is considered a completed task as per the given conditions.

   1) [Step 1] The user started the session by visiting the homepage ("/customer/dashboard").
   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "Restaurants" link to navigate to the list of restaurants.
   3) [Step 3] The user selected a specific restaurant from the list ("/customer/dashboard/restaurant/9").
   4) [Step 4] The user interacted with elements within the restaurant page by scrolling down and clicking on an image.
   5) [Step 5] The user completed the conversion action by clicking on the "Add to Cart" button for that restaurant.

   I have considered all the logs in this session, as they provide a clear indication of the user's actions leading up to and including the conversion event.
