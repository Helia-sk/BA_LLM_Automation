==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: While the user initiated tasks such as clicking on the "Restaurant Login", "Already have an account? Sign in", and interacting with the username input field, they did not complete the task of filling out their username or submitting the login form. This indicates that the user started a session but did not proceed to completion, which is characteristic of a drop-off.

   User Journey:
   1) [Step 1] The user navigated to the Restaurant Login page (indicated by clicking on "Restaurant Login").
   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the link to sign in if they already have an account (indicated by clicking on "Already have an account? Sign in").
   3) [Step 3] The user interacted with the username input field, indicating that they started to enter their username. However, they did not complete this task or submit the login form, suggesting that they abandoned the session before completing it. This is consistent with a drop-off.
