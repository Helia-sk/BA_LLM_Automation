==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user did not complete the intended task (Customer Login), which was one of the initiated tasks.

   1) [Step 1] The user navigated to the homepage of the website ("http://localhost:5173/") from an unknown source, possibly a search engine or a link on another page.
   2) [Step 2] The user scrolled down the homepage to locate the "Customer Login" link.
   3) [Step 3] The user clicked on the "Customer Login" link ("http://localhost:5173/customer/login"), indicating an intended action.
   4) [Step 4] After clicking the "Customer Login" link, there is no further log entry indicating that the user completed the login process. Instead, the user scrolled on the homepage again (indicating they might have decided to leave or navigate away from the page).
   I have considered all the logs provided in the log file, and based on the conditions mentioned in your question, the session can be classified as a drop-off since one of the initiated tasks was abandoned.
