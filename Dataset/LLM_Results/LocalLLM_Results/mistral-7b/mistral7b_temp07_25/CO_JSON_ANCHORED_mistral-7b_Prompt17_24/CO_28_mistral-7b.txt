 Tag: Conversion

   Reason: The user initiated a login form submission (form_submit event) and completed it by entering their credentials (input_change events). After that, the user clicked on the "Sign In" button, which was not followed by any subsequent abandonment of tasks. Therefore, based on the provided logs, we can conclude that this session was a conversion.

   1) [Step 1] The user navigated to the restaurant login page (URL: http://localhost:5173/restaurant/login).
   2) [Step 2] The user entered their username and password in the corresponding input fields.
   3) [Step 3] After entering their credentials, the user clicked on the "Sign In" button to submit the form.
   4) [Step 4] The system processed the submitted data (submit_latency_ms: 0), indicating a successful login.
   Note: Although we see an input change event for the password field after the blur event, it does not indicate that the user abandoned the task or caused a drop-off because it is expected that users would verify their inputs before submitting the form.

All the provided logs were considered in making this decision.
