==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user initiated a task (clicking on the "Customer Login" button) but did not complete it, indicating that they left the page without logging in. This is evident from the fact that no subsequent logs show any actions related to the login process or navigation to another page that would suggest a successful conversion.

  1) The user landed on the homepage ("http://localhost:5173/") and scrolled through it (scroll event).
  2) The user then clicked on the "Customer Login" button located at the top right corner of the page.
  3) After clicking the login button, the user did not perform any further actions related to logging in or navigating to another page, suggesting that they left the page or closed the browser window. No subsequent logs show any activity indicating a conversion.
