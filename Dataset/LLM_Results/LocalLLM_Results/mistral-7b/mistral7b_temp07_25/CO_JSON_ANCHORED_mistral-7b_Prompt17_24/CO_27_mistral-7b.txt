 Tag: Conversion

   Reason: All initiated tasks have been completed in the given logs. The user made a click event on a "Accept" button, which is presumably associated with accepting an order, and this action corresponds to the backend POST request with the endpoint `orders.accept_order`. Additionally, there are no subsequent drop-off events or any other initiated tasks left uncompleted in the log file.

   1) The user initiates a session by accessing the restaurant dashboard (`/restaurant/dashboard`) at `2025-09-27T15:08:27.836Z`.
   2) At `2025-09-27T15:08:34.781Z`, the user performs a click event on the "Accept" button, presumably accepting an order. This action corresponds to the backend POST request with the endpoint `orders.accept_order`.
   3) The server responds with a successful HTTP response (status code 200) at `2025-09-27T17:08:34.819804`, confirming that the order acceptance was processed successfully on the backend.
   Note: All logs have been considered in this analysis, and there are no drop-off events or any other initiated tasks left uncompleted.
