 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user did not complete the checkout process (evidenced by the absence of a "purchase" event in the logs), indicating that they abandoned their shopping cart. This is supported by the fact that the last logged action was scrolling on the product page, suggesting they were still browsing instead of completing the transaction.

  1) [Step 1] The user navigated to the restaurant's website (/customer/dashboard) and scrolled through the available options.
  2) [Step 2] The user selected a specific restaurant and proceeded to the cart page (/customer/dashboard/cart).
  3) [Step 3] The user scrolled on the cart page, possibly reviewing their items or making adjustments.
  4) [Step 4] The user continued scrolling through the cart page without taking further action, indicating that they did not proceed to checkout.
  5) [Step 5] The user browsed another restaurant's details (/customer/dashboard), suggesting potential interest in a different option but did not make any further actions.
  6) [Step 6] The user again scrolled on the cart page without initiating a purchase, indicating that they decided to abandon their shopping cart and did not complete the transaction.

It is important to note that all logs were considered in making this decision.
