==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off

   Reason: One of the initiated tasks (scrolling and clicking on "Menu") was completed, but another task (interacting with the menu items on the menu page) was not started, as there are no logs indicating any interaction with the menu items. Therefore, since one of the initiated tasks was abandoned, the session is classified as a drop-off.

   1) [Step 1] User opens the web application (http://localhost:5173/restaurant/dashboard/menu) with version web-1.4.2 at 15:03:51.600.

   2) [Step 2] The user scrolls down to position y = 81 on the page at 15:03:51.600.

   3) [Step 3] The user clicks on the "Menu" link at x = 571, y = 125 at 15:03:48.126.

   Further logs do not indicate any interaction with the menu items on the menu page, so it is assumed that no further tasks were completed. The session was a drop-off because one of the initiated tasks (interacting with the menu items) was abandoned.
