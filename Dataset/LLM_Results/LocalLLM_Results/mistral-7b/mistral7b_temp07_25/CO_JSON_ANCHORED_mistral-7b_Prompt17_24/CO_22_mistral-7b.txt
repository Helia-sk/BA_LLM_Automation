 Tag: Conversion
   Reason: All initiated tasks in this session were completed. The user clicked on the link to navigate to the login/register page (Step 1), filled out the username field (Step 2), and then clicked on the password field, which would typically be followed by entering a password, but no log for that action was provided. However, since the user clicked on the "Login" button later, it can be assumed that they entered a password at this step. After clicking the "Login" button (Step 3), the session ended, indicating a successful login, which is considered a conversion in this context.

   User Journey:
   1) The user clicked on a link to navigate to the login/register page (this action initiated the session).
   2) The user filled out the username field.
   3) The user clicked on the password field, which would typically be followed by entering a password. However, no log for that action was provided.
   4) The user clicked on the "Login" button to submit their credentials.
   5) The session ended, indicating a successful login, which is considered a conversion in this context.
