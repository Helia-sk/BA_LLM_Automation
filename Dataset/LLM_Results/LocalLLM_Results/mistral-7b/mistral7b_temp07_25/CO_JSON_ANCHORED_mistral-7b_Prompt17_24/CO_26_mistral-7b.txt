 Tag: Drop-Off

   Reason: Although the user initiated tasks such as clicking on the "Add Item" button and navigating to the menu items, they did not complete any of the subsequent tasks like selecting an item, uploading a file, or clicking on other buttons suggesting that they abandoned the process before completion.

   1) [Step 1] User navigated to the restaurant's dashboard (/restaurant/dashboard/menu).
   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "Add Item" button, indicating an intent to add a new item.
   3) [Step 3] The user clicked on the area under the menu items, which might suggest they intended to upload an image or select an existing item, but no further action was taken.
   4) [Step 4] The user clicked on the "Saladmixvery healthy" option, suggesting possible interest in a specific item, but no additional interactions were made after this click.
   5) [Step 5] The user interacted with the SVG icon, which is unclear as to its purpose, and no further actions were taken after this interaction.

   It is important to note that all logs have been considered in making this decision. However, since the user did not complete any of the initiated tasks, the session was classified as a drop-off.
