==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The session started with a scroll event on the dashboard page and no further interactive actions were observed, such as clicking on any link or button. Additionally, the user scrolled through the restaurant detail page without interacting with any elements (e.g., images, review sections), which indicates that they didn't find anything interesting or relevant to engage with.
   1) [Step 1] The user accessed the dashboard page and initiated a scroll event on the page.
   2) [Step 2] The user navigated to a specific restaurant detail page by clicking on a link but did not interact with any elements on that page (images, reviews, etc.).
   3) [Step 3] The user scrolled through the restaurant detail page without performing any further interactive actions.
   To confirm, all initiated tasks were not completed in this session as the user did not click on any links or buttons, nor did they interact with any elements on the pages they visited, which led to a drop-off. It is essential to consider every log in the analysis to ensure an accurate decision.
