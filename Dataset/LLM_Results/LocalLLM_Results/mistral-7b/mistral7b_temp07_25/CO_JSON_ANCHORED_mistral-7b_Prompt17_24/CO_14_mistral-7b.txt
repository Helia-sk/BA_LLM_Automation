   Reason: The user completed all initiated tasks in this session. They clicked on the "Customer Login" link, which led them to the login page. After that, they filled out their username (which is "User1" in this case) and clicked on the username field twice, indicating they were typing something in it. Finally, they submitted the form, which implies a successful login.
