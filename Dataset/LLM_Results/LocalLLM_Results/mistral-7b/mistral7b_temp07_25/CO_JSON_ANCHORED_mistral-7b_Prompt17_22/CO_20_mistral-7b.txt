 Tag: Conversion

   Reason: The user initiated the task of logging in by clicking on the "Sign In" button, and then proceeded to fill out both the username and password fields. After that, they clicked on the "Submit" button. Although there is a click event for a link labeled "Hungry? Order delicious food from local restaurants", it does not disrupt the primary task of logging in.

   1) The user landed on the homepage (based on the first log which shows a click event on the homepage).
   2) The user initiated the sign-in process by clicking on the "Sign In" button.
   3) The user entered their username and clicked on the corresponding input field.
   4) The user entered their password and clicked on the corresponding input field.
   5) The user clicked on the "Submit" button to log in.
   However, there is an additional click event for a link labeled "Hungry? Order delicious food from local restaurants", but it doesn't seem to interfere with the primary task of logging in, so we consider this session as a conversion. The user may have simply clicked on the link out of curiosity or interest, without abandoning their initial task.
