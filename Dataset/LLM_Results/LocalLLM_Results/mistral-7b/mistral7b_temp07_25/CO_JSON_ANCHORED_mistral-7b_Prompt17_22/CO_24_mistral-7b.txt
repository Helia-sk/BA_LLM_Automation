==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user journey consists of multiple initiated tasks, but not all of them are completed. Specifically, the user clicked on the "Menu" link (Step 1) and then interacted with several elements on the menu page (Steps 2 to 5). However, the user did not complete any task that would be considered a conversion, such as adding an item to the cart or changing the order status. Therefore, since one of the initiated tasks was abandoned, this session is classified as a drop-off.

1) [Step 1] The user clicked on the "Menu" link to navigate to the menu page.
2) [Step 2] On the menu page, the user interacted with an SVG element (possibly an icon or image).
3) [Step 3] The user clicked on a form containing categories for Starters, Main Courses, Desserts, Drinks, Side Dishes.
4) [Step 4] The user clicked on an upload area for the image of a dish.
5) [Step 5] The user interacted with an SVG element again (possibly another icon or image).
6) [Step 6] The user did not complete any other tasks that would indicate a conversion, such as adding an item to the cart or changing the order status. Therefore, the session is classified as a drop-off.
