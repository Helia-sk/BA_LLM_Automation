==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off

   Reason: The user initiated tasks by clicking on "Restaurants" from the dashboard, then navigated to a specific restaurant page. However, no further interactions related to completing any task on that page were observed. Instead, the user clicked on "No image available", which could suggest exploration or confusion, but did not complete any other actions before leaving the site.

   1) [Step 1] The user accessed the customer dashboard (/customer/dashboard).
   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "Restaurants" link from the dashboard (/customer/dashboard).
   3) [Step 3] The user navigated to a specific restaurant page (/customer/dashboard/restaurant/9).
   4) [Step 4] The user clicked on an element within the restaurant's detail section, possibly out of curiosity or confusion, but did not perform any actions that could be considered a completed task.
   5) [Step 5] The user left the site without completing any other tasks initiated during the session. This suggests that the session was a drop-off as one of the initiated tasks (navigating to a restaurant page and possibly exploring its details) was abandoned.
