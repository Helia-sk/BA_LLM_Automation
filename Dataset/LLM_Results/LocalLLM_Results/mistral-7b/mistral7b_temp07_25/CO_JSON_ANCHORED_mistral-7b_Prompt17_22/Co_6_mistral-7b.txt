 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user initiated the task of clicking on the "Customer Login" link, but did not complete the subsequent tasks of entering a username and password. This indicates that the user abandoned the session before completing the login process, which is considered a drop-off in this context.

   User Journey Step-by-step:
   1) The user clicked on the "Customer Login" link (Log 8).
   2) The user clicked on the username input field (Log 7).
   3) The user did not perform any action, suggesting that they may have decided against entering a username.
   4) The user clicked on the password input field (Log 6), but again, no further action was taken, indicating that the user chose not to enter a password.
   5) The user did not submit the login form (no log indicates a submission).

   All logs have been considered in this analysis. The user initiated the task of logging in, but did not complete it, which is indicative of a drop-off.
