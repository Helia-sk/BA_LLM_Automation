==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: One of the initiated tasks, i.e., adding a new item (based on the "Add" action in the logs), was not completed. The user clicked on the "Add" button but did not proceed to fill in the required field or submit the form.

   Step 1) The user accessed the restaurant dashboard.
   Step 2) The user navigated to the settings section by clicking on the "Settings" link.
   Step 3) The user clicked on the "Add" button, which was presumably for adding a new item or setting, but no further interaction related to this action was observed in the logs.
   Step 4) The user interacted with some elements within the settings section (based on click events), suggesting that they were exploring or trying to find the specific function to add a new item or setting.
   Step 5) The user then left the application, as no further interactions were logged after this point.

It's important to note that while the user initiated an action (adding a new item or setting), they did not complete it, which is why we classify this session as a drop-off. All logs were considered in reaching this decision.
