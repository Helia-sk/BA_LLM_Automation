 Tag: Conversion

   Reason: All initiated tasks in this session were completed. The user first clicked on the "Customer Login" link, then navigated to the login page and clicked the "Already have an account? Sign in" button, which led them to the login form where they interacted with the username input field by clicking it and finally typing in their username (indicated by the 'debounce' event). After that, there were no further interactions or events that suggest abandonment.

   1) The user navigated to the homepage of the website.
   2) The user clicked on the "Customer Login" link.
   3) The user was redirected to the login page.
   4) The user clicked on the "Already have an account? Sign in" button.
   5) The user interacted with the username input field by clicking it and eventually typed their username (indicated by the 'debounce' event).
   At this point, we can conclude that the user completed all initiated tasks, indicating a conversion.
