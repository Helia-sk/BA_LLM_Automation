==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off

   Reason: The user initiated a task by visiting the dashboard page (Step 1), but they did not complete any of the subsequent tasks. Instead, they scrolled through the page and then navigated to another section of the dashboard (Steps 2 and 3). However, after scrolling further, they again navigated to a different section without completing any initiated tasks or reaching the final destination.

   1) The user visited the customer dashboard page (Log 10: URL: "http://localhost:5173/customer/dashboard").

   2) The user scrolled through the dashboard, possibly looking for specific information (Log 9: Scroll event).

   3) The user navigated to another section of the dashboard (Log 8: Scroll event and URL change).

   4) The user scrolled further on this new section of the dashboard (Log 7: Scroll event).

   5) The user again navigated to a different section without completing any initiated tasks or reaching the final destination (Log 6: Scroll event and URL change).

   The logs do not indicate that the user completed any tasks, so we cannot classify this session as a conversion. Instead, it appears to be a drop-off due to the user's inaction and navigation away from the intended task or destination without completion.
