==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user initiated a task by clicking on the "Customer Login" button, but did not complete any subsequent tasks related to the login process. Instead, the user clicked on an input field for the username and then left the page. As the user did not perform any actions that indicate a successful completion of the intended task (login), we classify this session as a drop-off.

1) [Step 1] The user navigated to the homepage from the restaurant dashboard settings. (log with session_id: "session_1758982735683_3nzzg6k0z")
2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "Customer Login" link, initiating a login process. (log with session_id: "session_1758982745841_zt9tbfo0t")
3) [Step 3] The user clicked on the username input field, but did not enter any credentials or perform any other actions related to the login process. (log with session_id: "session_1758982746939_7qttgtuwg")
4) [Step 4] The user navigated away from the page, indicating an abandonment of the intended task. (log with session_id: "session_1758982706939_7qttgtuwg")

All initiated tasks were not completed, so we classify this session as a drop-off. The user journey ended without a successful login.
