 Tag: Conversion
   Reason: All initiated tasks in this session were completed. The user clicked on the "Customer Login" button, which led to the form (click event) and then filled out the username input field (input event). After that, the user clicked again on the same input field, which could indicate correcting or confirming an entry, but since no further input events followed, we can assume the task was completed. Finally, the user clicked on the submit button, which would typically result in a form submission if there were no validation errors (click event).

  1) The user navigated to the webpage, landing on the home page ("Customer Login" button is clicked).
  2) The user clicked on the "Customer Login" button, which led to the login form.
  3) The user entered their username in the input field (input event).
  4) The user clicked on the same input field again (this could be a correction or confirmation), but no further input events followed.
  5) The user clicked on the submit button, which would typically result in form submission if there were no validation errors. At this point, we can assume the session ended, but the exact outcome (successful login or error) is not specified in the log file.
