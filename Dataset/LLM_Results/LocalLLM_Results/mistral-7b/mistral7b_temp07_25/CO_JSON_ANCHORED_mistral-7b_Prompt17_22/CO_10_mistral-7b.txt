 Tag: Drop-Off

   Reason: The user initiated tasks by clicking on "Orders", "Balance", and then "View Details". However, after clicking on "View Details", there are no more actions from the user in the log file. Since one of the initiated tasks (Viewing Details) was abandoned without completion, this session is considered a drop-off.

   1) [Step 1] The user navigated to the customer dashboard page by clicking on "Orders" from the menu at position (355, 127).

   2) [Step 2] On the Orders page, the user clicked on "Balance" at position (483, 127), indicating an interest in checking their balance.

   3) [Step 3] After clicking on "Balance", the user navigated to the Balance page. Then, they initiated another action by clicking on "View Details" for one of the orders. However, there are no further actions from the user, which suggests that they abandoned this task and left the application without completing it.

   It is essential to consider all logs in the session to make an informed decision about whether it was a drop-off or conversion. In this case, since one of the initiated tasks (Viewing Details) was abandoned, the session is classified as a drop-off.
