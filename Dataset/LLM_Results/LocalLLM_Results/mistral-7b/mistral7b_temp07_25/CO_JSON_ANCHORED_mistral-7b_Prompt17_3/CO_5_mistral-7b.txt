 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The session started with a click on the "Customer Login" button (indicating the initiation of a login task), but it appears that no subsequent logs show any further interaction related to completing this task, such as entering credentials or clicking the submit button. Instead, there are multiple scroll events, which could indicate browsing behavior, but no other interactions related to the login process were observed in the log file.

  1) [Step 1] The user navigated to the homepage ("http://localhost:5173/").
  2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "Customer Login" button, indicating the start of a login task.
  3) [Step 3] The user scrolled down the page (scroll event).
  4) [Step 4] The user scrolled back to the top of the page (scroll event).
  5) [Step 5] The user scrolled down the page again (scroll event).
  6) [Step 6] The user scrolled back to the top of the page once more (scroll event).
  7) [Step 7] The user did not interact with any other elements, and the session ended.

After reviewing all the logs in the file, it appears that the user started a login task but did not complete it, which indicates a drop-off. It is essential to consider every initiated task and both conditions (completion or abandonment) when making this determination.
