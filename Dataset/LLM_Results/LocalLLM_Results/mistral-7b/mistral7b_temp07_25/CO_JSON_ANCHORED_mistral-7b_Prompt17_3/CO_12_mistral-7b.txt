 Tag: Conversion
   Reason: The user initiated two tasks, navigated to the Menu page and then clicked on the "Add Item" button, which indicates a clear intention to interact with the system. After clicking the "Add Item" button, there are no further logs indicating any other task initiation or abandonment. Therefore, as all initiated tasks were completed, this session is classified as a Conversion.

   User Journey:
   1) [Step 1] The user visited the restaurant dashboard page.
   2) [Step 2] The user navigated to the Menu page by clicking on the "Menu" link.
   3) [Step 3] The user interacted with an input field (implied from the click event on the input element) and entered data as indicated by the subsequent click event on the "Add Item" button.
   There are no further logs in the provided data, so it is not possible to determine any additional steps the user may have taken. However, since all initiated tasks were completed, this session is classified as a Conversion.
