==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user initiated a task (clicking on "Add Item") but did not complete it, indicating an abandoned interaction.

   1) [Step 1] The user accessed the restaurant's menu dashboard at http://localhost:5173/restaurant/dashboard/menu.
   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "Add Item" button located at coordinates (1505, 185). However, no subsequent logs indicate the completion of this task, such as adding an item or navigating away from the menu page.
   3) [Step 3] The user interacted with various items in the menu by clicking on them but did not initiate any additional tasks related to adding an item. For example, the user clicked on "Saladmixvery healthy", "best dessert ever", and "MojitoSuper Minti" but did not proceed with adding these items to the cart or completing any other tasks.
   4) [Step 4] The user clicked on the back button (indicated by clicking an svg element at coordinates (536, 132)) without initiating any additional tasks or completing any previous ones.
   I have considered all the logs provided to arrive at this conclusion.
