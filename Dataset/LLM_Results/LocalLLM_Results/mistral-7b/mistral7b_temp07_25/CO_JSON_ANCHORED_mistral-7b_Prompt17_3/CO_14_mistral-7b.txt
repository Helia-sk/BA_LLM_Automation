 Tag: Conversion

   Reason: The user initiated the task of navigating to the customer login page and subsequently clicked on the username input field, indicating that they are preparing to enter their credentials. After that, the user clicked on the username input field again, which suggests they were typing in a username. This is followed by clicking on the password input field, another indication of entering credentials. The user then navigated away from the username input field and clicked on the "Customer Login" button, which would typically be the final step to submit the login form. Since all initiated tasks were completed, we can classify this session as a conversion.

   1) The user navigated to the customer login page (http://localhost:5173/customer/login).
   2) The user clicked on the username input field, preparing to enter their credentials.
   3) The user clicked on the username input field again, indicating typing activity.
   4) The user clicked on the password input field, continuing to provide their credentials.
   5) The user navigated away from the username input field and clicked on the "Customer Login" button, submitting the login form.
