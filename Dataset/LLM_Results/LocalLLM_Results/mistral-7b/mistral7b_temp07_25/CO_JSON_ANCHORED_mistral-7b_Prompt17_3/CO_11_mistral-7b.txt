==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user initially navigated to the "/customer/dashboard" page, but they did not complete any initiated tasks. Instead, they scrolled through the page multiple times and eventually left the site without performing any actions that could be considered a conversion (e.g., clicking on a product, adding it to the cart, or making a purchase).

  1) [Step 1] The user started a new session by accessing the website at "/customer/dashboard".
  2) [Step 2] The user scrolled through the page multiple times (as indicated by three scroll events), but did not interact with any elements on the page.
  3) [Step 3] After some time, the user left the site without performing any actions that could be considered a conversion.

   The logs provided do not show any additional interactions or activities that would suggest the session was a conversion. Therefore, based on the given conditions, this session should be classified as a drop-off. It's important to note that further analysis might reveal more information about the user's behavior and potential reasons for leaving the site without completing a task. However, with the limited data provided in these logs, it's not possible to make definitive conclusions or recommendations for improving the user experience.
