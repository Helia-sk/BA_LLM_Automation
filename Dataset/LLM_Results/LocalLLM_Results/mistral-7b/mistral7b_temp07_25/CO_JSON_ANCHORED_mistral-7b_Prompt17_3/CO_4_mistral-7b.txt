 Tag: Conversion

   Reason: The user initiated the task of clicking on the "Restaurant Login" link (log 9), followed by navigating to the login page and initiating a click event on the username input field (log 10). After that, the user entered their username (implied from log 2-6 as the username input field was clicked and text was typed), then completed the task of clicking on the "Sign In" button (implied from log 7 as no sign in event was logged after this action). The user did not abandon any initiated tasks, so we can classify this session as a conversion.

   1) The user navigated to the Restaurant's homepage (not shown in logs).
