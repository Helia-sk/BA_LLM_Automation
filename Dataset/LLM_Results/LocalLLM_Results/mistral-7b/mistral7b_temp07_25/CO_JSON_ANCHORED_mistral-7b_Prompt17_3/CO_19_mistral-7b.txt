 Tag: Drop-Off

   Reason: The user clicked on the "Customer Login" link but did not complete the login process, which indicates that they abandoned the intended task. However, we need to consider all logs to confirm our decision.

   1) [Step 1] - User navigated from "/restaurant/dashboard/settings" to the homepage ("/") at 2025-09-27T14:18:55.683Z.
   2) [Step 2] - At 2025-09-27T14:19:05.841Z, the user clicked on the "Customer Login" link.
   3) [Step 3] - The user did not complete the login process, indicating that they abandoned the intended task.
   4) [Step 4] - At 2025-09-27T14:19:06.939Z, the user clicked on the username input field but did not enter any data and did not proceed with the login process further.
   5) [Step 5] - No additional actions were taken by the user in the logs provided.

   Since the user initiated a task (Customer Login) but did not complete it, we classify this session as a Drop-Off. We have considered all the logs provided to make our decision.
