==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: One of the initiated tasks (accepting an order on the backend) was abandoned. While there are logs from the frontend indicating user interaction, the "http_request" for the "orders.accept_order" endpoint does not show a completed request, which suggests that the user did not complete the intended action (accepting the order).

   User Journey:
   1) [Step 1] The user initiated a POST request to accept an order on the backend server, indicated by the "http_request" log.
   2) [Step 2] The user received an OPTIONS response from the server, which is a preflight request and not the actual acceptance of the order, as shown in the third and fourth logs. This suggests that the user may have been prompted for additional information or validation before completing the action.
   3) [Step 3] The user interacted with the frontend application, clicking on the "Accept" button, as indicated by the fifth log. However, this does not correspond to a completed order acceptance in the backend logs (the "http_response" for "orders.accept_order"). This indicates that the user did not complete the intended action and abandoned the session, resulting in a drop-off.
   Note: All logs have been considered in this decision making process.
