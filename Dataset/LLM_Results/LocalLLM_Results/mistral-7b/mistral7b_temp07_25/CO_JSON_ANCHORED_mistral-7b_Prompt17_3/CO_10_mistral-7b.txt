==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user initially clicked on the "Balance" link, indicating an initiated task. However, the next action in the log shows the user clicking on the "Orders" link, which suggests a change of intent rather than completion of the initial task. After that, the user clicked on the "View Details" button for one of the orders, but no further actions related to completing the order or any other tasks were logged. Since not all initiated tasks (balance check and order completion) were completed, the session is classified as a drop-off.

  1) The user accessed the customer dashboard.
  2) The user initiated a task by clicking on the "Balance" link.
  3) The user abandoned the initial task by clicking on the "Orders" link.
  4) The user viewed order details but did not complete any other tasks.

The logs provided do not show any further actions, so it can be assumed that the session ended without completing any initiated tasks.
