 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user initiated a task (scrolling down the page and clicking on the "Restaurant 4" option) but did not complete it by leaving the page without any further interaction.

   1) [Step 1] User arrived at the homepage ("customer/dashboard").
   2) [Step 2] User scrolled down the page, indicating potential interest in exploring options.
   3) [Step 3] User clicked on the "Restaurant 4" option.
   4) [Step 4] User scrolled further down the page for Restaurant 4 but did not interact any more, indicating a possible abandonment of that task and eventually leaving the page.
   At the end: All initiated tasks were not completed, so the session was classified as a drop-off. It's important to note that this analysis is based on the information provided in the log file. Additional context or user behavior might change this classification if it indicates completion of other tasks.
