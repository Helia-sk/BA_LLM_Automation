==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user initiated two tasks (clicking on the "Restaurant PartnersRegister your restaurant or log in to manage orders" link and entering a username) but did not complete either task. Instead, the user clicked on the "Log In" button but did not enter a password before abandoning the session.

  1) [Step 1] The user navigated to the login page of the Restaurant Partners website (http://localhost:5173/restaurant/login).
  2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "Restaurant PartnersRegister your restaurant or log in to manage orders" link.
  3) [Step 3] The user clicked on the "Log In" button to initiate the login process.
  4) [Step 4] The user entered a username ("User1").
  5) [Step 5] The user did not enter a password and abandoned the session.

   It is important to consider all logs in the decision-making process, as it ensures an accurate analysis of the user's behavior on the website. In this case, although the user initiated the login process, they did not complete it by entering a password, so the session should be classified as a drop-off.
