==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off

   Reason: The user initiated a task (clicking on "History") but did not complete it by clicking on the "View Details". Instead, they clicked on "Reject" which suggests they left the page without completing the desired action.

   1) [Step 1] - User navigated to the restaurant dashboard page (http://localhost:5173/restaurant/dashboard).
   2) [Step 2] - User clicked on the "History" link located at x = 676, y = 126.
   3) [Step 3] - User arrived at the history page (http://localhost:5173/restaurant/dashboard/history).
   4) [Step 4] - User clicked on the "Reject" button located at x = 1538, y = 298. This action indicates that they left the page without completing the desired task (viewing details of a history item).
   The user did not initiate or complete any other tasks in the provided logs, so all initiated tasks were abandoned. Therefore, this session was classified as a drop-off.

   Note: It is important to consider all logs when making a decision. In this case, even though the user navigated to the history page and clicked on a link within that page, they did not complete the intended action (viewing details), which contributes to classifying this session as a drop-off.
