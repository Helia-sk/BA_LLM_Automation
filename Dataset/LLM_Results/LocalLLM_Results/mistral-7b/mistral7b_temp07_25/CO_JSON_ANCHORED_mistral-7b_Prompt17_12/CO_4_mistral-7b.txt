 Tag: Conversion

   Reason: The user initiated a task (clicking on the "Restaurant Login") and completed it by entering their username and password. After that, they clicked on the button to sign in, which is another initiated task. Although there are multiple clicks happening within the session, they do not constitute independent tasks since they are part of the sign-in process. As all initiated tasks were completed, this session can be classified as a conversion.

   1) The user navigated to the Restaurant Login page (as indicated by clicking on the "Restaurant Login" link).

   2) The user clicked on the "Already have an account? Sign in" button, which initiated the sign-in process.

   3) The user focused on the username input field and then entered their username.

   4) The user focused on the password input field and then entered their password.

   5) The user clicked on the "Sign In" button to submit their login credentials.

   To ensure we considered all logs, the last log shows additional clicks within the session but these are not independent tasks as they are part of the sign-in process initiated by the "Already have an account? Sign in" button click.
