 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: One of the initiated tasks was abandoned. In this case, the user clicked on the "Settings" link but did not complete any further tasks related to adding a new item (e.g., clicking on the input field or the "Add" button).

   2) [Step 2] The user navigated to the settings section by clicking on the "Settings" link.
   3) [Step 3] The user did not interact with any elements related to adding a new item in the settings, indicating they abandoned this task.
   Note: Since no further tasks were completed after this step, the session can be classified as a drop-off. It is important to consider all logs to ensure accuracy in decision making.
