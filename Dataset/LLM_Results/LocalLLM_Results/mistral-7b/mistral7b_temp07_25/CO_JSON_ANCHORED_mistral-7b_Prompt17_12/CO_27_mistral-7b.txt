==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The session initiated with a click event on a button labeled "Accept", but it seems that no subsequent events related to the "orders.accept_order" endpoint were found in the backend logs, suggesting that the order acceptance task was not completed.

   User Journey Steps:
   1) [Step 1] The user initiated a session on the restaurant dashboard (URL: http://localhost:5173/restaurant/dashboard). This was indicated by a click event on the button labeled "Accept".
   2) [Step 2] The user's browser made an HTTP request to accept an order via the "/api/orders/26/accept" route. However, this request did not result in a response from the backend server, indicating that the order was not accepted at this point.
   3) [Step 3] The browser sent an OPTIONS request to the same endpoint, but again, no response was received, suggesting that the order acceptance task was still not completed.
   [No further steps were found in the provided logs as they only contained events related to the initial order acceptance attempt.]
