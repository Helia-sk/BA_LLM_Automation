==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: One of the initiated tasks (View Details) was abandoned by the user, so it's not possible to classify this session as a conversion.

   User Journey:
   1) [Step 1] The user opened the webpage at the restaurant dashboard.
   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "History" link to access the history page.
   3) [Step 3] The user clicked on one of the history items to view its details.
   4) [Step 4] The user did not interact with the "View Details" button, indicating that they abandoned this task (View Details).
   5) [Step 5] The user closed the history page by clicking on the "X" button.
   6) [Step 6] The user left the webpage without performing any other actions.
   Since one of the initiated tasks was abandoned, this session is classified as a drop-off. It's essential to ensure that all logs are considered when making such decisions.
