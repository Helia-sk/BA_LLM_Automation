 Tag: Conversion

   Reason: All initiated tasks were completed. The user first clicked on the "Menu" link, then scrolled down the page, and finally performed a scroll event which indicates that they have interacted with the content. There was no indication of any task being abandoned.

   1) [Step 1] The user accessed the website at http://localhost:5173/restaurant/dashboard/menu.
   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "Menu" link with an ID and class name (details not provided). This action triggered a 'click' event.
   3) [Step 3] After clicking on the "Menu", the user scrolled down the page, triggering a 'scroll' event.
   4) [Step 4] The user continued scrolling, reaching a point where they performed another 'scroll' event with specific coordinates. This suggests that they were interacting with the content on the page.
   (No further logs were provided to determine subsequent actions, but since all initiated tasks were completed, it can be inferred that the user did not abandon the session.)
