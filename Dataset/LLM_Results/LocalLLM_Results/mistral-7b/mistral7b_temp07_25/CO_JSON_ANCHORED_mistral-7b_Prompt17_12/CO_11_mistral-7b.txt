 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user initiated the task of navigating to the "customer/dashboard" page, but did not complete any other tasks in the logs provided. The user scrolled through the page and then left the site without interacting with any other elements on the page or initiating another task.

   1) [Step 1] The user initiated a session by accessing the website from a browser.
   2) [Step 2] The user navigated to the "customer/dashboard" page, but did not interact with any other elements on the page.
   3) [Step 3] The user scrolled through the page and then left the site without initiating another task or interacting with any other elements on the page.
   I have considered all the logs provided in my analysis, as I only looked at the initiated tasks that were completed or abandoned. Since none of the tasks were completed, I classified this session as a drop-off.
