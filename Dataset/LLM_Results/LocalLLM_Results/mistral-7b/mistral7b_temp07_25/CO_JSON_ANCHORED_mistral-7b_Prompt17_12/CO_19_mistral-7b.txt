==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off

   Reason: The user initiated a task (clicking on "Customer Login") but did not complete it, instead navigating away from the page. This indicates that the user did not go through with the login process.

   1) [Step 1] The user was browsing the Restaurant Dashboard Settings.
   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on a link to navigate to the Customer Login page.
   3) [Step 3] The user interacted with the username input field by clicking it, but did not enter any information or complete the login process.
   4) [Step 4] The user then navigated away from the Customer Login page, which suggests that the session was a drop-off as one of the initiated tasks (login) was abandoned.

   To confirm this decision, it is important to note that no subsequent logs indicate further interaction with the Customer Login or any other pages that would suggest completion of the login process or another task.
