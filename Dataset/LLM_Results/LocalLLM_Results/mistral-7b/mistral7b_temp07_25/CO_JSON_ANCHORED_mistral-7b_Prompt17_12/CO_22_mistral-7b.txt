 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user initiated two tasks (clicking on the "Restaurant Partners" link and filling in the username field), but did not complete the second task (entering a password). Since one of the initiated tasks was abandoned, the session is classified as a drop-off.

   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "Restaurant Partners" link to either register or log in (indicated by the click event at x:823, y:437).
   3) [Step 3] The user filled in the username field with the value "User1".
   4) [Step 4] The user did not fill in the password field, indicating that they abandoned the login process (indicated by the absence of an input change event for the password field).
