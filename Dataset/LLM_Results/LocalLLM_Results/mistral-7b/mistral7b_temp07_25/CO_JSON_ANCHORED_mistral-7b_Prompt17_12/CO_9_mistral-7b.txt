==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: One of the initiated tasks (scrolling down on the page) was abandoned as indicated by the last log, where the user scrolled to a certain position and did not continue scrolling. This suggests that the user did not complete all initiated tasks.

   1) [Step 1] The user accessed the homepage at "<http://localhost:5173/customer/dashboard>".
   2) [Step 2] The user scrolled down the page as indicated by the second to last log, but did not scroll any further in the last log.
   3) [Step 3] The user clicked on a restaurant item (restaurant/4), indicating interest, but did not proceed further with any other actions related to that restaurant or any other initiated tasks.
   At the end: It seems all the logs have been considered as the list includes all events from the start of the session to the end where the user left the page without completing any further tasks, which classifies this as a drop-off.
