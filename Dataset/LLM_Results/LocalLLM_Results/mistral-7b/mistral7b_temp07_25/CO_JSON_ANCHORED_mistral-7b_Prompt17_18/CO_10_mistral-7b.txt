 Tag: Drop-Off

   Reason: Although the user initially accessed the "Balance" and "Orders" sections of the dashboard, they did not complete any tasks related to those sections. Instead, they clicked on "Balance", but no subsequent logs show a completion of that task. Furthermore, the user clicked on "Orders" but also did not perform any actions related to it. The user then clicked on "View Details" in the Orders section, but there are no subsequent logs indicating a completion of this action either. Lastly, the user clicked on "Order" again, which could be considered a backtracking or confusion action, and then closed the session by clicking on "X".

   1) The user accessed the customer dashboard (homepage).

   2) The user navigated to the "Balance" section but did not perform any actions related to it.

   3) The user navigated to the "Orders" section but did not perform any actions related to it or complete the task of viewing order details.

   4) The user clicked on "View Details" in the Orders section, but there are no subsequent logs indicating a completion of this action.

   5) The user clicked on "Balance" again, which could be considered a backtracking or confusion action.
