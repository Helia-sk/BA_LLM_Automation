==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: One of the initiated tasks (scrolling down and clicking on "Menu") was abandoned without completion. The user did not navigate to any other pages or perform any other actions that could be considered as a conversion event.

  1) [Step 1] User opened the web application with URL http://localhost:5173/restaurant/dashboard/menu at time 2025-09-27T15:03:51.600Z (log_1758985431599_x7th5obah).
  2) [Step 2] User scrolled down the page to y=81 from y=0 (log_1758985431599_ioqmc3uaa).
  3) [Step 3] User clicked on the "Menu" link at x=571 and y=125 (log_1758985428126_kn0xlelbo). This action could be considered as a user navigating within the same page. However, no further actions were recorded, indicating that the user left the page without performing any other actions. Therefore, this session was a drop-off.
   All logs have been considered to the end to ensure an accurate decision.
