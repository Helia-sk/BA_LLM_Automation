 Tag: Drop-Off

   Reason: The user initiated the tasks to log in to the Restaurant, but did not complete the subsequent steps of entering a username and password. This indicates that the session was abandoned before all necessary tasks were completed.

   1) [Step 1] The user clicked on the "Restaurant Login" link (log_1757772852515_uvv507x14).
   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the username input field (log_1757772853662_q9fok5nbl), suggesting they intended to enter their username. However, no log shows a username being entered, so we can assume that this task was abandoned.
   3) [Step 3] The user clicked on the password input field (log_1757772852604_b9jqgk9nz), but again, no log shows a password being entered, indicating that this task was also abandoned.
   4) [Step 4] The user clicked on the username input field again (log_1757772853662_lp2vv7jeb), which could suggest they were trying to correct an error, but no subsequent log shows a username being entered, so we can assume this task was also abandoned.
   5) [Step 5] The user clicked on the password input field again (log_1757772854639_c7qhj0kpz), but no subsequent log shows a password being entered, indicating that this task was also abandoned.
   6) [Step 6] The user did not complete any further tasks, so we can conclude that the session was abandoned and tag it as a drop-off.
