 Tag: Drop-Off

   Reason: The user initiated a task by navigating to the dashboard ("/customer/dashboard") and scrolling through the page, but they did not complete any other tasks. Specifically, they did not click on any links or interact with any elements that would suggest a task was completed. They also did not navigate to another page, as indicated by the consistent "route" value of "/customer/dashboard".

   1) [Step 1] User navigated to the customer dashboard (/customer/dashboard).
   2) [Step 2] User scrolled down the page to position y = 310.3999938964844.
   3) [Step 3] User scrolled further down the page to position y = 1348.800048828125.
   4) [Step 4] User scrolled again, this time to position y = 2044.
   5) [Step 5] The user did not interact with any other elements on the page or navigate to another page, indicating that they abandoned their session and did not complete any tasks.

   All initiated tasks (navigating to the dashboard and scrolling) were completed, but one of the initiated tasks (interacting with elements or navigating to another page) was abandoned, making this a drop-off session. It is important to note that all logs were considered in making this determination.
