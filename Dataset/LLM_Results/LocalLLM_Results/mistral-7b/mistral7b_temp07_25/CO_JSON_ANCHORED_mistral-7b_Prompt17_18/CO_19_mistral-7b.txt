 Tag: Drop-Off

   Reason: The user initiated a task (Click on "Customer Login") but did not complete it. Instead, they clicked away from the login form without entering any credentials, suggesting that they left the site without completing the intended action.

   1) [Step 1] User navigated to the restaurant dashboard settings page ("/restaurant/dashboard/settings").
   2) [Step 2] The user then clicked on the "Customer Login" link located at position (1659, 19).
   3) [Step 3] The user opened a new tab or window, as indicated by a new session ID ("session_1758982745841"), and clicked on the customer login input field. However, they did not enter any credentials.
   4) [Step 4] The user then clicked away from the login form without completing the login process, as indicated by a new click event on an unrelated element (not part of the login form).
   5) [Step 5] The user navigated away from the site, as evidenced by another page view event ("/"). This new session indicates that the previous session was abandoned.

   It is important to note that while the user did not complete the intended action (customer login), they did not encounter any apparent errors or issues during their interaction with the site. This suggests that the issue may have been related to the user's intention or decision, rather than a problem with the site itself. As such, it would be beneficial to investigate potential reasons for the drop-off, such as site usability, clarity of the login process, or user expectations.
