 Tag: Drop-Off

   Reason: The user initiated the task of navigating to the restaurant page (4th log) but did not complete any further actions that could be considered as a completed task. In the logs, there is no evidence that the user performed any action related to interacting with the restaurant details or making a reservation.

   1) [Step 1] The user started a new session by visiting the customer dashboard (1st log).
   2) [Step 2] The user scrolled through the dashboard, indicating they were exploring options (2nd and 3rd logs).
   3) [Step 3] The user clicked on the "Restaurants" tab to navigate to the restaurant list page (4th log).
   4) [Step 4] The user scrolled down the restaurant list page but did not interact with any of the restaurants, suggesting they were still browsing for options (5th and 6th logs).
   5) [Step 5] The user scrolled back up the page, possibly reconsidering their choice (7th log).
   6) [Step 6] The user clicked on a div that displayed "No image available" (8th log), which might indicate they were looking for more information about a specific restaurant. However, this action does not lead to any further interaction, indicating the user dropped off without completing a task.

   Note: Although the user scrolled back up the page (7th log), this action alone is not conclusive evidence of a decision or intent to return to the previously viewed restaurants. The absence of subsequent actions confirms that the user dropped off.

   All logs have been considered in making the decision and classifying the session as a drop-off.
