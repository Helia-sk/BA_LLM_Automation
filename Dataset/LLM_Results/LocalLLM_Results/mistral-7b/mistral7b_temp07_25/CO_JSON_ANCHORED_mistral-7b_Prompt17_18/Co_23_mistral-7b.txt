 Tag: Conversion
   Reason: All initiated tasks were completed. The user clicked on the "Settings" link, navigated to the settings page, clicked on the "Add" button twice (implicitly initiating two tasks), entered data into an input field, and finally clicked on the "Submit" button.

   User Journey:
   1) [Step 1] The user clicked on the "Settings" link from the dashboard.
   2) [Step 2] The user navigated to the settings page upon clicking the "Settings" link.
   3) [Step 3] The user found the "Add" button and clicked on it, implicitly initiating a task.
   4) [Step 4] The user clicked on the "Add" button again, continuing the task initiated in step 3 but potentially starting a new one.
   5) [Step 5] The user interacted with an input field, presumably entering data for the task(s) initiated in steps 3 and 4.
   6) [Step 6] The user clicked on the "Submit" button to complete the tasks.
