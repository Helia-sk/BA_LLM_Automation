==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user initiated tasks by clicking on the "Register your restaurant or log in to manage orders" link, but did not complete any of the subsequent tasks related to logging in or managing orders. Instead, the user clicked on the username field and the form, indicating an intent to interact further, but no additional interactions were recorded that would indicate a successful login or order management task completion.

   User Journey:
   1) [Step 1] The user navigated to the restaurant partners login page (indicated by the URL "/restaurant/login").
   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "Restaurant Partners Register your restaurant or log in to manage orders" link (log_1758983087044_filnd8z02).
   3) [Step 3] The user clicked on the username field (log_1758983087706_po7bjncib), indicating an intent to enter their login credentials. However, no log was recorded for entering a username or password.
   4) [Step 4] The user clicked on the form (log_1758983087044_filnd8z02) again, but no subsequent logs were recorded indicating further interaction with the login page or order management tasks.
   Since the initiated task (login or order management) was abandoned, this session is classified as a drop-off.
