 Tag: Conversion

   Reason: All initiated tasks in the session were completed. The user clicked on the "History" link, then proceeded to click on a history item to view its details, and finally closed the details by clicking the "X" button. After that, the user navigated to the "Balance" page by clicking on it, indicating a completed task.

   1) The user started the session by visiting the "Balance" page (balances.html).
   2) The user clicked on the "History" link, initiating a new task.
   3) The user clicked on a history item to view its details, starting the "View History Details" task.
   4) The user closed the history details by clicking the "X" button, completing the "View History Details" task.
   5) The user navigated to the "Balance" page (balances.html) again, completing the "Navigate to Balance Page" task.

   I have considered all the logs in the session. The user initiated two tasks: viewing history details and navigating to the balance page. Both of these tasks were completed, indicating a conversion.
