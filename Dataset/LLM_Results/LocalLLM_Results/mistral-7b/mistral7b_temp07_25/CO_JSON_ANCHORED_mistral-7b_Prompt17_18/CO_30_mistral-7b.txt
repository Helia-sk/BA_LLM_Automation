 Tag: Drop-Off

   Reason: One of the initiated tasks, "View Details", was completed, but another task, "Reject Order", was initiated and eventually performed (indicated by the "Reject Order" button click). Since not all initiated tasks were completed, the session is considered a drop-off.

   1) [Step 1] The user navigated to the restaurant dashboard page.
   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "History" link to view the order history.
   3) [Step 3] The user viewed a specific order detail by clicking on the "View Details" button.
   4) [Step 4] The user initiated the process of rejecting an order by clicking on the "Reject Order" button (indicating drop-off).

   To ensure that all logs were considered:
   - The initial page view was recorded as a navigation event.
   - Multiple clicks on various buttons and links were noted, such as "History", "View Details", "Reject Order".
   - Information about the user agent, session ID, timestamps, and other relevant details were captured in each log entry.
