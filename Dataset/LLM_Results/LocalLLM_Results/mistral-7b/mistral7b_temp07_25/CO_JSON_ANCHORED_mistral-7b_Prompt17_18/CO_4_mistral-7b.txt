 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: Although the user initiated tasks by clicking on the "Restaurant Login" link and then filling out the login form, they did not complete the task of submitting the login form. Instead, they clicked on the "Already have an account? Sign in" button, which suggests that they may have intended to register instead of logging in, but didn't follow through with that action either. This indicates that the user abandoned the session without completing a conversion event.

  1) [Step 1] The user navigated to the Restaurant Login page on the website.
  2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "Restaurant Login" link to initiate the login process.
  3) [Step 3] The user filled out the login form by entering their username (though no username was recorded in the log).
  4) [Step 4] Instead of submitting the login form, the user clicked on the "Already have an account? Sign in" button to initiate the sign-up process.
  5) [Step 5] The user did not complete the sign-up process either, indicating that they abandoned the session without completing a conversion event.
