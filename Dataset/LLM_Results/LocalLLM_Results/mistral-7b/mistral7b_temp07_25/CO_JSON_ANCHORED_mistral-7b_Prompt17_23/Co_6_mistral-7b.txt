 Tag: Drop-Off

   Reason: The user initiated the task of clicking on the "Customer Login" link, but did not complete the subsequent steps required for a conversion such as entering a username and password. Instead, the user's interaction with the page ended after clicking on the login form.

   1) [Step 1] The user navigated to the "/customer/login" page by clicking on the "Customer Login" link.
   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the login form, indicating an intent to start the login process.
   3) [Step 3] However, the user did not enter any username or password and did not submit the login form. Instead, the user's interaction with the page ended without completing the login process.
   I have considered all the logs in my decision making. The user initiated a task (clicking on the "Customer Login" link) but did not complete it, which is a drop-off.
