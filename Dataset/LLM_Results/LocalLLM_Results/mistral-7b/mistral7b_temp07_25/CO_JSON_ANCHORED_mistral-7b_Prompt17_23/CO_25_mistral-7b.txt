==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user initiated a task (clicking on the "Menu" button) but did not complete it, instead they scrolled and clicked somewhere else on the page. This indicates that the user was not fully engaged with the intended functionality of the "Menu" button, suggesting a drop-off.

   1) [Step 1] The user accessed the restaurant dashboard (URL: http://localhost:5173/restaurant/dashboard/menu).
   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "Menu" button located at x=571, y=125.
   3) [Step 3] The user scrolled down the page to x=1134, y=588 and clicked somewhere else (trigger: click).
   4) [Step 4] The user then scrolled back up to x=0, y=81 (trigger: scroll).
   It is important to note that all logs were considered in this analysis. The user did not complete the task initiated by clicking on the "Menu" button, hence the classification as a drop-off.
