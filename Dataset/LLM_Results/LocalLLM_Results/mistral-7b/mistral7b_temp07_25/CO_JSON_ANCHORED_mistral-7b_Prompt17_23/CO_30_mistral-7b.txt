==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user initiated a task (clicked on "History") but did not complete it by clicking on any other task. Instead, they clicked on the "Reject" button, which indicates that they abandoned the task they initially started.

   1) [Step 1] User navigated to the restaurant dashboard page ("/restaurant/dashboard").
   2) [Step 2] User clicked on the "History" link located at x = 676, y = 126.
   3) [Step 3] User clicked on the "Reject" button (x = 1538, y = 298).
   It is important to note that while the user did not complete any other tasks in this session, we cannot rule out the possibility of future sessions where they may complete more tasks. However, based on the logs provided, this particular session can be classified as a drop-off.
