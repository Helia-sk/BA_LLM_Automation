==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: Although the user initiated tasks such as clicking on "Menu", "ImageDrag image here or click to upload", and navigating through the form, they did not complete any of the tasks within the session. Specifically, the user clicked on the "ImageDrag image here or click to upload" but did not actually upload an image. Furthermore, they clicked on the "Save Changes" button within the form, but abandoned the session before completing it.

   Here is the user journey step-by-step:
   1) The user clicked on the "Menu" option in the navigation bar to access the menu management page.
   2) The user then initiated the task of uploading an image by clicking on "ImageDrag image here or click to upload".
   3) However, the user did not actually upload an image but instead navigated through the form fields.
   4) The user clicked on the "Save Changes" button within the form but abandoned the session before completing it.
   As all initiated tasks were not completed, the session is classified as a drop-off.
