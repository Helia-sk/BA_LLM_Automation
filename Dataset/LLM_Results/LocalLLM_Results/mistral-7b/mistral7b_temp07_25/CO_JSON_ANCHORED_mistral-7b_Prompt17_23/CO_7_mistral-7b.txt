==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off

   Reason: The user initiated the task of clicking on the "Customer Login" link, but did not complete the subsequent tasks such as entering a username and password. The session ended without the completion of the login process.

   1) [Step 1] User navigated to the homepage (indicated by the first log with the tag "FORM").
   2) [Step 2] User clicked on the "Customer Login" link, initiating the task of logging in (log with id "log_1757773371689_3ak46jhcx").
   3) [Step 3] User clicked on the username input field to initiate typing a username (log with id "log_1757773372596_2oj0c59xu"). However, the log shows that the user did not type anything in the field and instead clicked elsewhere on the form, which indicates abandonment of this task.
   4) [Step 4] User clicked on the username input field again, but still did not enter any text (log with id "log_1757773373072_scoku9tbi").
   5) [Step 5] User clicked on the password input field (log with id "log_1757773373072_scoku9tbi"), but did not enter a password, indicating abandonment of this task as well.

   It appears that all initiated tasks were abandoned in this session, hence it is classified as a drop-off.
