==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off

   Reason: The user initiated tasks but did not complete them. They clicked on the "Menu" link, then clicked on the "Add Item" button, and finally clicked inside an input field for a menu item. However, the log does not show any further interaction indicating that they filled out the form or submitted it. Since one of the initiated tasks was abandoned, we classify this session as a drop-off.

   1) [Step 1] The user navigated to the restaurant dashboard page (/restaurant/dashboard/menu).
   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "Menu" link located at x=601, y=124.
   3) [Step 3] The user clicked on the "Add Item" button located at x=1540, y=219.
   4) [Step 4] The user interacted with an input field for a menu item (however, no subsequent interaction suggests that they did not complete the form or submit it).
   We have considered all the logs provided in the log file to the end. No further assumptions were made.
