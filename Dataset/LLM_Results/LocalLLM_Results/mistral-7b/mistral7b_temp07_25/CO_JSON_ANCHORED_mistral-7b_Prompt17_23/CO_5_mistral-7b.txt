 Tag: Drop-Off

   Reason: The user clicked on the "Customer Login" button, indicating an initiated task. However, the subsequent logs show that the user did not complete any other tasks related to the login process (such as entering a username or password). The last logged event was a scroll event, which suggests that the user may have navigated away from the login page without completing the task.

   1) [Step 1] User visited the homepage ("http://localhost:5173/").
   2) [Step 2] User scrolled down the homepage (indicating possible exploration).
   3) [Step 3] User clicked on the "Customer Login" button, initiating the login process.
   4) [Step 4] No further logged events related to the login process were found, suggesting that the user did not complete the login task.
   5) [Step 5] The last logged event was a scroll event on the homepage, which could indicate that the user navigated away from the login page without completing the task.

   Please note that this decision is based on the given logs and assumes that all relevant tasks for a successful conversion (in this case, completing the login process) are included in the log file. If additional information or logs are available, the classification may need to be re-evaluated.
