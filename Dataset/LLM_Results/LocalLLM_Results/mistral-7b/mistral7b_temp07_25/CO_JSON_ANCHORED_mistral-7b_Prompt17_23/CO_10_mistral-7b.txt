 Tag: Conversion

   Reason: The user initiated tasks by clicking on "Balance" and then navigated to that page. Afterwards, the user clicked on "Orders", indicating an interest in viewing their orders. The user continued the journey by clicking on the "View Details" button for one of their orders. This suggests that the user was engaged with the platform and completed all initiated tasks.

   1) The user started by accessing the customer dashboard.

   2) The user clicked on the "Balance" link to view their account balance.

   3) The user navigated to the "Orders" section by clicking on the corresponding link.

   4) The user chose to view the details of one of their orders by clicking on the "View Details" button.

   I have considered all the logs in my decision making, as each event corresponds to a click action, which indicates user interaction with the platform. The user initiated tasks and completed all of them, suggesting a conversion.
