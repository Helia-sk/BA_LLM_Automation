 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The session started with a page view (indicating the user navigated to the customer login page from another part of the website) followed by clicking the "Customer Login" button. However, the subsequent logs show that the user clicked on an input field for the username but did not proceed to enter any information or click the submit button, which suggests they abandoned the task. The final log shows the user navigated away from the customer login page without completing any tasks, indicating a drop-off.

   Here is the user journey step-by-step:
   1) [Step 1] The user navigated to the customer login page from another part of the website (indicated by the initial page view log).
   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "Customer Login" button, indicating they intended to start the login process.
   3) [Step 3] The user clicked on the username input field, but did not enter any information or click the submit button, suggesting they abandoned the task.
   4) [Step 4] The user navigated away from the customer login page without completing any tasks, indicating a drop-off.

   I have considered all the logs in my decision making. There is no indication that the user completed any initiated tasks, so I classified this session as a drop-off.
