 Tag: Conversion

   Reason: The user initiated two tasks (clicking on the "Restaurant Login" link and entering their username) out of the four potential tasks (login, password input, submit form, drop-off). They completed both these tasks without abandoning any of them.

   1) [Step 1] User clicked on the "Restaurant Login" link.
   2) [Step 2] User entered their username in the username input field.
   3) [Step 3] User did not attempt to input a password as no log related to password input was found.
   4) [Step 4] User submitted the form by clicking on the password input field (as it was assumed since no separate "Submit" button click log was found).

   All the logs were considered in this analysis, and the user journey represents a successful login event, suggesting a conversion.
