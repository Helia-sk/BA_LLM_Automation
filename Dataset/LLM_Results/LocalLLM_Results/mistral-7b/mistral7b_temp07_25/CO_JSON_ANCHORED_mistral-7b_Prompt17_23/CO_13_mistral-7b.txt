 Tag: Drop-Off

   Reason: The user initiated tasks by clicking on "View Details", but it seems that after this action, no further actions related to completed tasks were logged. This indicates that the user may have navigated away from the site without completing any other tasks, which would classify this session as a drop-off.

   1) [Step 1] The user accessed the restaurant dashboard page (/restaurant/dashboard/history).
   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "View Details" button to view more details about an item or order, but no subsequent action related to completing this task was logged.
   3) [Step 3] The user clicked on the "X" button, which could suggest that they were trying to close a popup or dismiss some information, but again, no further actions were logged.
   4) [Step 4] The user clicked on the "History" link in the navigation menu, indicating an interest in viewing the history of orders or events.
   5) [Step 5] The user did not take any other actions that were logged, suggesting that they may have navigated away from the site without completing any other tasks.
   In this log, all initiated tasks were not completed, so the session is classified as a drop-off. It's essential to consider every logged action when making this determination, and in this case, since no further actions related to completed tasks were recorded, the session was deemed a drop-off.
