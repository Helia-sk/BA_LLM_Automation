 Tag: Drop-Off

   Reason: The user initiated the task of logging in as a customer, but did not complete it. They clicked on the "Customer Login" button, but no subsequent logs show any interaction with the username or password input fields, which are necessary for login completion.

   1) [Step 1] The user accessed the website (URL not specified in the logs).
   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "Customer Login" link.
   3) [Step 3] No subsequent interaction with the username or password input fields was observed, indicating that the login process was abandoned.

   All initiated tasks were not completed, so the session was a drop-off as defined in the question. The logs provided do not show any additional actions after the "Customer Login" click, which is necessary for a conversion to occur.
