 Tag: Conversion
   Reason: The user initiated the task of navigating to the "Menu" page and then clicked on the "Add Item" button, which indicates an intent to add an item to the menu. After that, the user interacted with the input field for the item name, which is a common step in adding a new item. Since all the initiated tasks were completed, we can classify this session as a conversion.

  1) [Step 1] The user navigated to the "Menu" page by clicking on the appropriate link.
  2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "Add Item" button, indicating an intent to add a new item to the menu.
  3) [Step 3] The user interacted with the input field for the item name, which is a common step in adding a new item.
  4) [Step 4] No further interactions were recorded after the user completed the input for the item name, suggesting that they may have submitted the form or navigated away from the page. However, since all initiated tasks were completed, we can still consider this session as a conversion.
