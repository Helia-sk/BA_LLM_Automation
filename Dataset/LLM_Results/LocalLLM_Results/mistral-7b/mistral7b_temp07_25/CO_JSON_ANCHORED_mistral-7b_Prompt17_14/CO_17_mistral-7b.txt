 Tag: Conversion

   Reason: The user initiated a task (clicking on "Restaurants") and completed it by clicking on a specific restaurant ("No image available"). After that, the user clicked on another task ("No image available"), which could be considered as an interaction with the content but not necessarily a completion of a task. However, the final action was clicking on a button ("Add to Cart") which is a clear indication of a conversion.

   1) The user started by accessing the dashboard.
   2) The user clicked on the "Restaurants" link.
   3) The user scrolled down to view a specific restaurant and clicked on its image (or the placeholder "No image available").
   4) The user scrolled further down the page and interacted with another part of the restaurant's details, but this is not explicitly a task completion.
   5) The user clicked on the "Add to Cart" button, which is a clear indication of a conversion action.
