==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off

   Reason: While the user initially navigated to the "History" page, they did not complete any of the initiated tasks on that page. Instead, they clicked on the "X" button (indicating they might have wanted to close a dialog or an item), and then clicked on another button labeled "View Details", which suggests they were interested in viewing details but did not actually do so. This is followed by two more clicks on buttons labeled "X" and "View Details", indicating that the user might have been exploring options but ultimately did not complete any task.

   1) The user initiated a session by navigating to the "History" page of the restaurant dashboard (log 9).
   2) The user clicked on a button labeled "X" (log 8), possibly closing a dialog or an item on the page.
   3) The user clicked on another button labeled "View Details", indicating potential interest in viewing details, but did not actually do so (log 7).
   4) The user clicked twice more on buttons labeled "X" and "View Details", suggesting further exploration but no completion of tasks (logs 6 and 5).
   5) The session ended without any initiated task being completed (log 4).

   It is important to note that all the logs provided were from the "History" page. If there were additional logs showing the user completing tasks on other pages, the classification might be different. However, based on the provided logs, it appears that the session was a drop-off as no initiated tasks were completed.
