 Tag: Conversion

   Reason: The user initiated a task by clicking on the "Customer Login" button, and subsequently performed other actions such as scrolling and interacting with the login form. The user did not abandon any initiated tasks, instead they completed all the tasks they started.

   1) [Step 1] User navigated to the homepage (http://localhost:5173/).
   2) [Step 2] User scrolled through the page reaching the "Customer Login" button.
   3) [Step 3] User clicked on the "Customer Login" button, initiating a new task.
   4) [Step 4] User scrolled down to the login form and started interacting with it by typing in their credentials.
   5) [Step 5] User did not abandon any tasks, instead they completed the login process. This indicates that they were engaged and interested enough to proceed with the intended action, which was a conversion in this case.

After reviewing all the logs, I can confirm that the user journey from start to finish was a conversion as the user initiated a task (logging in) and successfully completed it without abandoning any tasks along the way.
