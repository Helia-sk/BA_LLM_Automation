 Tag: Conversion

   Reason: The user initiated tasks (clicking on Balance, Cart, Orders, and View Details for an order) and completed them by clicking "View Details" for an order.

   1) [Step 1] User clicked on the "Balance" link in the dashboard to check their balance.
   2) [Step 2] User clicked on the "Cart" link in the dashboard, indicating they wanted to view their shopping cart.
   3) [Step 3] User clicked on the "Orders" link in the dashboard, showing an interest in viewing their previous purchases.
   4) [Step 4] After checking the orders, the user decided to click on the "View Details" button for one of the orders. This indicates a desire to learn more about that specific order.
   All these steps indicate that the user was actively engaging with the website, and since they completed all initiated tasks, it can be classified as a conversion.
   I have considered all the logs in my analysis. The user's journey started with checking their balance, then moving on to view their shopping cart, their previous orders, and finally, examining the details of one of their orders.
