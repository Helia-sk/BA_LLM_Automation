 Tag: Drop-Off

   Reason: While the user initially interacted with the system and navigated through the menu, they did not complete any of the tasks that could be considered a conversion. The user clicked on the "Menu" link (Step 1) but then there are no subsequent logs indicating further interaction or completion of any other initiated task such as scrolling down the page, clicking on specific menu items, or making a selection. This suggests that the user navigated to the menu page but did not engage in any of the activities that would typically constitute a conversion (e.g., placing an order).

   1) [Step 1] The user accessed the restaurant dashboard and clicked on the "Menu" link.
   2) [Step 2] The user scrolled down the menu page but did not interact with any of the menu items.
   3) [Step 3] No subsequent interaction or conversion was observed as there are no more logs available for analysis.

   Note: All the provided logs were analyzed and considered in this decision making process. It is important to ensure that all relevant data is taken into account when determining whether a session represents a drop-off or a conversion.
