==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: One of the initiated tasks (View Details) was not completed, indicating that the user did not finish the intended action.

   1) [Step 1] The session started with a page view on the dashboard ("/restaurant/dashboard").
   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "History" link to navigate to the history page ("/restaurant/dashboard/history").
   3) [Step 3] The user viewed the details of an item by clicking "View Details", but did not complete the action (the "View Details" event was logged, but no subsequent "Close Details" or similar event was found).
   4) [Step 4] The user clicked on the "History" link again to return to the dashboard.
   5) [Step 5] The user clicked the "Reject" button on the dashboard, indicating that they decided to leave the application without completing any other tasks.
   Note: I have considered all the logs in my decision making. The user initiated the task of viewing details but did not complete it, which is a sign of drop-off behavior.
