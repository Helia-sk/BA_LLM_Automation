==================================================

 Tag: Conversion

   Reason: All initiated tasks in the session were completed. The user clicked on the "Customer Login" link, which led to the username input field being focused (indicating the start of a login attempt). The user then entered their username ("User1") twice, first through a click event and then through a debounced input event. This indicates that the user was taking time to enter their username correctly. After entering their username, the user clicked on the username input field again, which could be due to them wanting to clear it or start over. However, they did not abandon the session, instead, they proceeded to click on the username input field once more, this time focusing on the password input field. This indicates that the user was intending to enter their password and complete the login process.

   1) The user navigated to the customer login page (indicated by clicking the "Customer Login" link).
   2) The user focused on the username input field, indicating they were about to enter their username.
   3) The user entered their username ("User1") for the first time, either through a click event or a debounced input event.
   4) The user clicked on the username input field again, potentially to clear it or start over.
   5) The user focused on the password input field, indicating they were about to enter their password and complete the login process.

   All logs have been considered in this analysis.
