 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: Although the user initially navigated to the "History" page, they did not complete any other initiated tasks such as viewing details of a specific order. Instead, they went back to the dashboard and eventually left the session by closing the browser.

  1) [Step 1] The user initiated a navigation to the "/restaurant/dashboard" page at 2025-09-27T15:20:35.792Z.
  2) [Step 2] At 2025-09-27T15:20:43.885Z, the user clicked on the "History" link on the dashboard page.
  3) [Step 3] The user viewed the history page at 2025-09-27T15:20:45.667Z by clicking on the "View Details" button for one of the orders. However, they did not complete any other actions on this page.
  4) [Step 4] At 2025-09-27T15:20:43.885Z, the user clicked the "Back" button to go back to the dashboard page.
  5) [Step 5] The user clicked on the "Reject" button at 2025-09-27T15:20:45.667Z to close the session.

The user initiated a task (navigating to the History page) but did not complete it, so this session should be classified as a drop-off. All logs have been considered in making this decision.
