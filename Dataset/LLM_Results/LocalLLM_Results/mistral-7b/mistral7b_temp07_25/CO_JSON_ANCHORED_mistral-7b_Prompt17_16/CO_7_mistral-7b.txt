 Tag: Conversion
   Reason: All initiated tasks were completed. The user clicked on the "Customer Login" link, filled out the username field (although no username was entered), clicked on the username field, and then clicked the submit button. Since all these actions lead to a submission, we can classify this session as a conversion.

   User Journey:
   1) The user clicked on the "Customer Login" link. [Navigated to the login page]
   2) The user clicked on the username input field. [Prepared to enter username]
   3) The user clicked outside of the username input field. [Did not enter any username]
   4) The user clicked on the submit button without entering a username. [Attempted to log in with an empty username]
