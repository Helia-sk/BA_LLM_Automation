==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off

   Reason: The user initiated a login process but did not complete it by submitting the form, instead they clicked on the "Sign In" button and then left the input field for the password blank. This indicates that they may have encountered an issue or decided not to proceed with the login at this time, which is considered a drop-off.

   1) [Step 1] The user opened the webpage of the restaurant site (http://localhost:5173/).
   2) [Step 2] The user navigated to the login page (http://localhost:5173/restaurant/login).
   3) [Step 3] The user entered their username in the username field.
   4) [Step 4] The user left the password field blank and clicked on the "Sign In" button.
   5) [Step 5] The user did not fill in any value in the password field, indicating they may have encountered an issue or decided not to proceed with the login at this time. (This is the drop-off point).

   It should be noted that the log file does not contain data on subsequent actions taken by the user after this session, such as returning to the site later and potentially completing the login process. However, based on the data provided, the session can be classified as a drop-off since one of the initiated tasks (login) was abandoned.
