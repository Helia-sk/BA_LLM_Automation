 Tag: Conversion

   Reason: All initiated tasks were completed. The user clicked on the "Customer Login" link, which took them to the login form. After that, they clicked on the username input field and then clicked on the password input field. This indicates they intended to fill out the login form. Subsequently, they clicked on the username input field again (possibly to start typing their username), but no log was generated for the password input field, which suggests they successfully entered their username and moved onto entering their password. Finally, they clicked on the submit button of the login form, indicating a successful login attempt.

   1) User navigates to the homepage (not logged in).
   2) Click on the "Customer Login" link.
   3) Arrive at the login page.
