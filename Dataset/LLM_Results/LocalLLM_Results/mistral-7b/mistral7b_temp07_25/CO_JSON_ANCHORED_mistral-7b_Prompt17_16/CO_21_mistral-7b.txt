 Tag: Conversion

   Reason: The user initiated a task (clicking on the "Restaurant PartnersRegister your restaurant or log in to manage orders") and then proceeded to complete another task (logging in). Although there is a gap between these two events, it's reasonable to assume that the user navigated to another page for authentication purposes. After logging in, no further tasks were abandoned, indicating successful completion of the session.

   1) [Step 1] The user accessed the homepage ("http://localhost:5173/") after coming from the dashboard ("http://localhost:5173/restaurant/dashboard").
   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "Restaurant PartnersRegister your restaurant or log in to manage orders" link.
   3) [Step 3] The user navigated away from the homepage, presumably to the login page for authentication purposes.
   4) [Step 4] The user logged in, as indicated by clicking on the username input field and then typing something into it (though this is not explicitly shown in the logs).
   5) [Step 5] The user did not initiate any other tasks, indicating successful completion of the session.
