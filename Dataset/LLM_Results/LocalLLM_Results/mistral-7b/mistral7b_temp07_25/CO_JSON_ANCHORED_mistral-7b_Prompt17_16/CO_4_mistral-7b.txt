==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user initiated a task (clicking on the "Restaurant Login" link) but did not complete it. Instead, they clicked on a different link ("Already have an account? Sign in") and that seems to be the last action taken before the end of the log file, suggesting that the user may have navigated away from the login page without logging in.

   User Journey:
   1) The user arrived at the Restaurant Login page (indicated by clicking on the "Restaurant Login" link).
   2) No further actions related to the login process were observed, indicating that the user did not proceed with logging in.
   3) Instead, the user clicked on the link "Already have an account? Sign in", which suggests that they may have been considering signing up for an account instead of logging in.
   However, no subsequent actions related to signing up were observed, and the log file ends, so it is unclear whether the user completed this task or not. It seems likely that they either navigated away from the site or did not complete the sign-up process. Therefore, further analysis would be required to confirm the exact outcome of this session.
