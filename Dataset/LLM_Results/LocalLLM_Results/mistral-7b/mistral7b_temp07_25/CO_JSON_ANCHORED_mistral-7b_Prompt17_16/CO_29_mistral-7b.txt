==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: Although the user clicked on various links and buttons, they did not complete any of the initiated tasks such as viewing details for a transaction or navigating to the history page. Instead, they closed a popup (X button) and left the "history" page without returning to it.

  1) [Step 1] The user navigated to the dashboard page of the restaurant application.
  2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "History" link located under the "Order History" section.
  3) [Step 3] The user clicked on the "X" button to close a popup (presumably an order detail) and did not proceed further on the "history" page.
  4) [Step 4] The user navigated away from the history page, possibly by clicking on another link or closing the application.

   Note: In this log file, there are no logs that indicate the user completing any of the initiated tasks, hence the classification as a "Drop-Off." It's essential to consider all logs in order to make an informed decision and accurately understand the user journey.
