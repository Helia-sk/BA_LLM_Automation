==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user initiated tasks, but only completed one task (username input), suggesting that the subsequent tasks were abandoned.

   User Journey Step-by-step:
   1) The user clicked on a link to access the restaurant partner login/registration page (Log ID: log_1758985133183_qr0zt2rti).
   2) The user clicked on the "Username" input field (Log ID: log_1758985133860_4znr19nye).
   3) The user entered a username ("User1") and triggered the blur event for that field (Log ID: log_1758985135389_wenesuzwe).
   4) The user clicked on the "Password" input field but did not enter anything before the session ended, indicating that they abandoned this task (No corresponding log found).
   5) The user did not click on the "Login" button or perform any other action that would indicate a successful login or registration, suggesting that they left the page without completing their intended action (No corresponding log found).

   All initiated tasks were not completed, so the session was a drop-off.
