==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: One of the initiated tasks (View Details) was not completed, indicating that the user did not follow through with the intended action.

   1) [Step 1] The user accessed the restaurant dashboard page (/restaurant/dashboard/history).
   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "History" link to navigate to the History section of the dashboard.
   3) [Step 3] The user clicked on the "View Details" button, but did not complete this action, indicating that they did not view the details of any item in the history.
   4) [Step 4] The user clicked on the "X" button, possibly to close a popup or go back to the previous page, but no subsequent actions were recorded in the log file, suggesting that the session ended without completing any other tasks.

The decision was made based on the fact that not all initiated tasks (View Details) were completed, which led to the classification of this session as a drop-off. All the logs provided in the log file were considered in making this determination.
