==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user initiated tasks by clicking on the "Restaurant Login" link, then interacted with the username input field (indicated by two "click" events and two "input_change" events), but did not complete the task by entering any text or submitting the form. Instead, the user stopped interacting after clicking on the username input field.

   Step 1) User clicked on the "Restaurant Login" link to initiate the login process.
   Step 2) User navigated to the username input field and clicked on it twice (possibly due to an error or change of mind).
   Step 3) User entered text into the username input field, but did not submit the form or interact with any other elements on the page.
   Step 4) User stopped interacting with the page after entering text into the username input field.

   All initiated tasks were not completed (only one task was initiated), so based on the provided conditions, this session can be classified as a drop-off. It is important to consider all logs when making a decision to ensure accuracy and avoid any guesswork or presumptions.
