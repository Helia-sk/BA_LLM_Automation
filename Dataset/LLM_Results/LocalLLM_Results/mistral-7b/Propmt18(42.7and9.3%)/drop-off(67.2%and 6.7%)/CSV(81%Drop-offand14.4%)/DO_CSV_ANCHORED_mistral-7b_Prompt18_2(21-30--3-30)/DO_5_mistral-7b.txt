 Tag: Drop-off

1) The user navigated to the "/customer/login" page, indicating they may have been attempting to log in or sign up. However, no subsequent "submit" events were recorded for either the username or password fields, which are typically associated with a login attempt.

2) There is no event indicating that the user successfully filled out and submitted the required form fields (username and password). This lack of a successful form submission indicates that the login process was not completed, suggesting a drop-off in this session.

3) The user's interaction with the page was limited to scrolling and clicking on various elements, but no subsequent action that would indicate progress towards a conversion (e.g., adding items to a cart, proceeding to checkout, etc.). This further supports the idea of a drop-off in this session.

4) The user's interaction with the page was focused mainly on the login area and did not explore other areas or engage in any actions that could lead to a conversion (e.g., browsing products, adding items to wishlist, etc.). This lack of exploration indicates that the user may have been frustrated by their inability to log in and chose to leave the site without completing any additional actions.

5) The user's interaction with the page was brief, as there is only a 13-second time gap between the first scroll event and the last click event. This suggests that the user quickly decided they were unable to log in or complete another desired action on the site, leading to a drop-off.

Overall, the session appears to be a drop-off as the user was unable to complete any actions associated with a conversion and did not engage in additional exploration on the site after arriving at the login page.
