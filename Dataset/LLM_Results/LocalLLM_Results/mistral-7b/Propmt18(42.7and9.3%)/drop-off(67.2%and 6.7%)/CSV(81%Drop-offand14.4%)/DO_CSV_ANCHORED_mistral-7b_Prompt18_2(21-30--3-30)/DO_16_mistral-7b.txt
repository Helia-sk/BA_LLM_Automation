==================================================

1) Identify the user interaction events in the log file. The events of interest are clicks and input changes for the form fields (username and password).
  2) Determine the sequence of events. From the log, it appears that the user first clicked on the username field, then entered "User" followed by "User1", and finally clicked on the password field. No subsequent input was recorded for the password field.
  3) Check for a conversion event. A conversion event in this case would be when both the username and password fields have been filled and submitted. Since no such event is present, it seems that the user did not complete the form (login).
4) Determine if it was a drop-off or a conversion. As no conversion event occurred, this session appears to be a drop-off [Reason: The user started the login process but did not complete it].
