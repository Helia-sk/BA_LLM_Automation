==================================================

1) Define the goals for the session, based on the website's purpose (in this case, it seems like the website is an online food ordering platform). In our analysis, we will consider a conversion to be when a user successfully places an order.

2) Identify the events that occurred during the session. From the logs provided:
- The user navigated to the login page (scroll and click events)
- The user entered their username (input_change event)
- The user clicked on the "Sign In" button (click event)
- It seems like the user did not provide a password or any other necessary information to complete the order, so it appears they have not actually placed an order.

3) Determine if the session was a drop-off or a conversion. Since the user has logged in but has not placed an order, this session can be considered as a drop-off because the primary goal of the session (ordering food) has not been achieved.
