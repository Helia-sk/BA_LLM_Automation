==================================================

1) [Check for page views and user interactions] The log file shows multiple events of user interactions such as clicks, window resize, and input changes related to the restaurant login page (/restaurant/login).

2) [Determine if the user provided necessary information] In this case, we do not see any events that indicate the user has filled out both the username and password fields.

3) [Check for any successful submission or confirmation of login] There is no evidence in the log file that a successful login has occurred (e.g., redirect to a different page, success message).

4) [Assess if there were any subsequent actions suggesting engagement post-login] In the absence of any user interactions after the login attempt, it's reasonable to infer that the session was likely a drop-off.

Tag: Drop-off [The user did not provide necessary information and no subsequent actions suggest engagement post-login]
