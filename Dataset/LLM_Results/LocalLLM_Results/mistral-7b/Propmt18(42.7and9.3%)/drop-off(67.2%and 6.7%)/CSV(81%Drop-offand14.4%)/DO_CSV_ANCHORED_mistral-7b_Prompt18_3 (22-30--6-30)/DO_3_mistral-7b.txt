 Tag: Drop-off

  1) The user clicked on the "Customer Login" button, indicating an attempt to log in.

  2) However, no subsequent logs show a successful login event or any other action that would indicate a conversion (e.g., purchase, registration, etc.).

  3) The last log entry shows the user interacting with the password input field, but there is no corresponding log for the actual submission of the password, which suggests that the user may have abandoned the login process without completing it.

  4) Additionally, there are no logs indicating any interaction after the last password change event, further supporting the idea that the user dropped off.

In conclusion, the session appears to be a drop-off because the user clicked on the "Customer Login" button but did not complete the login process or perform any other actions suggesting a conversion.
