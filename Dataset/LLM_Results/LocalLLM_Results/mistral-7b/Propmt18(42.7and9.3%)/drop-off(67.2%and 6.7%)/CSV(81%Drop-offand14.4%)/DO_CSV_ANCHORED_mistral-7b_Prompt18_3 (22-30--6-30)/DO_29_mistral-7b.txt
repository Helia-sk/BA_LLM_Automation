==================================================

 Tag: Drop-off
    Reason: The user clicked on the "Orders" link from the dashboard, but did not proceed to the "/restaurant/dashboard/menu" page, indicating that they may have navigated away from the site without completing a specific action. However, this is an assumption since we don't have enough data to confirm if the user returned or performed other actions on the site.

    Tag: Possible Return Visit
    Reason: The user revisited the same dashboard page (/restaurant/dashboard) after a certain duration, suggesting that they might be interested in the restaurant again. But without further data, we can't definitively say if this visit was a conversion or not.
