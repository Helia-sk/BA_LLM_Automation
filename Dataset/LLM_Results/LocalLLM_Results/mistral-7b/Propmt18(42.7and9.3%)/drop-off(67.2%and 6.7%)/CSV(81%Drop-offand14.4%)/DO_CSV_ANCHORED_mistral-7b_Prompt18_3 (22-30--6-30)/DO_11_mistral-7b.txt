==================================================

1) Identify the user interaction events in the log file.
- The user clicked on the "Customer Login" button (log_1757765038386_ucc709vcf).
- After clicking the "Customer Login" button, the user navigated to the login page and started interacting with the username input field.
  2) Determine if there was any event indicating a successful login.
- There is no log entry that indicates a successful login or any further interaction beyond the username field.

3) Based on the absence of a successful login event, we can infer that this session was likely a drop-off. The user navigated to the login page and interacted with the username input but did not complete the login process.

Tag: Drop-off [User did not complete the login process].
