==================================================

1) Identify the user action sequence in the log file.
    - User clicks on "Customer Login" link (indicating intent to start a session).
    - User enters username "User1".
    - User does not enter a password, instead clicks on the username input field.

2) Determine if this session was a drop-off or a conversion.
    - Since the user did not complete the login process by entering a password, it appears that this session was a drop-off. The user initiated an action (clicking on the "Customer Login" link), but did not follow through with the expected action (entering a password).

Tag: Drop-off. [User failed to complete the login process by not entering a password.]
