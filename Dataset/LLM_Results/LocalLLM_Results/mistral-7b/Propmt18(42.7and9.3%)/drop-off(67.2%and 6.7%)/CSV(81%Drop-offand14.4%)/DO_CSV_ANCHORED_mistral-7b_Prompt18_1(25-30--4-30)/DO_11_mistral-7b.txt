1) Identify the user action sequence in the log file. The user clicks on the "Customer Login" button, then enters their username (steps from log_1757765038386 to log_1757765042312). However, there is no record of a password being entered or a successful login.

2) Determine if the session was a drop-off or a conversion. Since the user did not enter their password and complete the login process, this session would be considered a drop-off. The user showed initial interest by clicking the "Customer Login" button but did not proceed with the intended action (providing their password).

Tag: Drop-off [User did not complete the login process]
