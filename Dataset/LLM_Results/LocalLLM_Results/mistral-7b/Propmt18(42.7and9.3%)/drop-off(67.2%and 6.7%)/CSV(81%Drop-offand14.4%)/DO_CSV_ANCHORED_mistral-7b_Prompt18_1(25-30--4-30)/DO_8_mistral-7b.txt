==================================================

 Tag: Drop-off
   1) The user clicked on the "Customer Login" link, indicating an attempt to start a session.
   2) After clicking the "Customer Login" link, the user interacted with the username input field by typing in "User1".
   3) However, there is no subsequent interaction from the user after entering their username. This could indicate that they did not proceed to enter their password and complete the login process.
   4) The lack of further interactions such as clicking on any other links or submitting forms suggests that the user may have navigated away from the page or encountered an issue that prevented them from completing the session.
   Thus, it appears that this session was a drop-off.
