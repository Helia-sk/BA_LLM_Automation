==================================================

1) [Step 1] Identify the key actions in the session that indicate user interaction with the application.
2) [Step 2] The session starts at "/restaurant/dashboard" where the user clicks on "Accept". This is likely a confirmation or agreement action, indicating the start of the session.
3) [Step 3] The user then navigates to "/restaurant/dashboard/menu" by clicking on "Menu". This suggests that they are exploring the main menu options within the application.
4) [Step 4] The user interacts with various elements on the menu page, including buttons and inputs, but does not seem to make a selection or complete any action that would constitute a clear conversion (e.g., adding an item to a cart, placing an order).
5) [Step 5] The user eventually clicks the "Add Item" button on the menu page, but no further interaction is recorded in the log file, suggesting they may have left the application or encountered an error at this point.
6) [Step 6] Based on these observations, it appears that the session was a drop-off as the user interacted with the application but did not complete any clear conversion action before leaving.

Tag: Drop-Off [User interacted with application but failed to complete a conversion action before leaving].
