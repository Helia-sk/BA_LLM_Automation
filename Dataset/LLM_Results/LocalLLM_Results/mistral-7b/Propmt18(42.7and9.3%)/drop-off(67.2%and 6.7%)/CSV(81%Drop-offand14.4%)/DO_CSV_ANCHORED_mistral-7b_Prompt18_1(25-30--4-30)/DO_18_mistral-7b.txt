==================================================

1) Identify the user interactions in the log file. The user first navigates to the login page (/restaurant/login). Then, the user interacts with the username input field, and after a few seconds, enters "User1" as the value. Next, the user interacts with the password input field but no value is entered. Finally, the user clicks on the "Register your restaurant or log in to manage orders" link, which suggests that the user intended to register or log in, but did not complete the registration process.

2) Determine if the session was a drop-off or a conversion. Since the user did not complete the registration process and navigated away from the registration page, this session can be classified as a drop-off.

Tag: Drop-off [The user did not complete the registration process]
