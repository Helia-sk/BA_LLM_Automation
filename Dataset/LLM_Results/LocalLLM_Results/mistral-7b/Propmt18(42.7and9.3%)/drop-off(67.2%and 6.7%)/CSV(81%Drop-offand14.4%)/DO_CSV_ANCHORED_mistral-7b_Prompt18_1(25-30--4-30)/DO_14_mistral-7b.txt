 Tag: Drop-off

1) Observed multiple user interactions (clicks and input changes) in the session related to the login form. However, no subsequent events indicating successful login or navigation to another page were observed.

2) The last observed event was an input change on the password field with no value provided, followed by a click event on the submit button. This could indicate an unsuccessful attempt at logging in.

3) Since there are no further events suggesting continued interaction with the application or successful login, it is reasonable to conclude that this session represents a drop-off.
