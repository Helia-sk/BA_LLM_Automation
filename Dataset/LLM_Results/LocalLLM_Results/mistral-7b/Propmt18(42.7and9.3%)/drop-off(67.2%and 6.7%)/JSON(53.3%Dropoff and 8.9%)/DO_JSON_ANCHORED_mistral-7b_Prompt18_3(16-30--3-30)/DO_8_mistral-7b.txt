 Tag: Drop-off
   1) The user clicked on the Customer Login button, indicating that they were intending to start a session.
   2) After clicking the login button, there are no further interactions or events in the log that suggest the user successfully completed their login and proceeded with a conversion.
   3) Since there is no evidence of any subsequent actions that would indicate a successful login or conversion, it appears that the user may have experienced an issue during the login process or decided not to continue with the conversion.
   4) Additional analysis of the log data could potentially reveal errors or issues that occurred during the login attempt, but based on the provided information, it is reasonable to conclude that this session was a drop-off.
