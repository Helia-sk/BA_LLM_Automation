 Tag: Drop-off
   1) The user initially landed on the homepage ("/") and scrolled down to view some content.
   2) After scrolling, they clicked on a link that led them to the "customer/login" page.
   3) On this page, they performed various actions such as scrolling and clicking on links, but there is no subsequent action indicating a successful login or navigation to another page.
   4) The user's interaction with the site seems to have stopped here, suggesting that they did not complete their intended action (in this case, logging in). The lack of further activity indicates a drop-off.
