 Tag: Drop-off

   Reason: The user interacted with the customer login form but did not proceed to fill in any information or submit the form, indicating a drop-off.

   1) User clicked on the "Customer Login" link to navigate to the login page.

   2) User clicked on the username input field to focus and type in their username (no data provided).

   3) User clicked on the password input field to focus and type in their password (no data provided).

   4) User clicked outside of the form area, indicating they may have decided not to proceed with logging in.

   The lack of a successful login submission suggests that this session was a drop-off.
