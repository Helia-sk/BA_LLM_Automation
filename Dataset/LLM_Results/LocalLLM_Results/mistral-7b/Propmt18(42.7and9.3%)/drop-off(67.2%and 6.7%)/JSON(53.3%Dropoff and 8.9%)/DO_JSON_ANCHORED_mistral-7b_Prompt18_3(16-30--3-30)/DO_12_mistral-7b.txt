 Tag: Drop-off
   1) The user clicked on the "LieferspatzRestaurant Login" link, indicating they are interested in logging in.
   2) However, there is no subsequent interaction or request related to login, suggesting the user did not proceed with the login process.
   3) No further interactions or requests indicating a successful login or any action that would indicate a conversion were observed.
   The session appears to have ended without the user taking an action that would lead to a conversion, hence it is classified as a drop-off.
