 Tag: Drop-off
   1) The user clicked on the "Register your restaurant" link, indicating that they are likely a new user who is not currently logged in.
   2) The user did not proceed to fill out the registration form or log in, instead they navigated away from the login page by clicking on the "Restaurant Partners" link.
   3) The user's session ended without any indication of a conversion (i.e., a successful login or registration).

This analysis suggests that the session was a drop-off, as the user did not complete the intended action (login or register).
