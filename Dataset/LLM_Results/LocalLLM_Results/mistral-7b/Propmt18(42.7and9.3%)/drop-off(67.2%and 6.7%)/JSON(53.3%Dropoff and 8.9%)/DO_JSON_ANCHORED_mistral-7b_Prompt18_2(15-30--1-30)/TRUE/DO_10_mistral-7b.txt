 Tag: Drop-off

  1) The user visited the Customer Login page, indicating an initial interest in the service.
  2) After clicking the "Customer Login" button, no subsequent interaction with the login form was observed, suggesting that the user did not proceed to input their credentials.
  3) No activity related to a successful login or navigation to other pages followed, which is typically expected after a user inputs their credentials and clicks submit.
  4) The user session ended without any evidence of conversion, such as account creation, password recovery, or purchase.

Based on the analysis of the log file, it appears that this was a drop-off session, as the user did not progress beyond the initial login step.
