==================================================

 Tag: Drop-off
   1) The user clicked on the "Customer Login" link, indicating that they are trying to access the login page.
   2) However, there is no subsequent interaction with the username or password fields, which suggests that the user may have left the page without logging in.
   3) The absence of a form submission event (like 'formSubmit' or 'submit') also supports the idea that the user did not complete the login process. This sequence of events indicates that the session was likely a drop-off, as the user didn't proceed to log in and potentially perform any further actions on the site.
