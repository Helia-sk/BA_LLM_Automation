 Tag: Session is a Conversion

   Reason: The user navigated through two different login pages, indicating intent to interact with the application. Subsequently, the user scrolled down on the homepage (indicating potential exploration or engagement), suggesting further interest in the platform. Although no final action, such as form submission or purchase, was recorded in this log file, the sequence of events indicates that the user's session is a conversion rather than a drop-off due to the exploration and navigation through different parts of the application.

   Steps:
   1) The user clicked on two distinct login options (Restaurant Login and Customer Login), indicating an intent to interact with the application.
   2) The user scrolled down on the homepage, suggesting further engagement or exploration of the platform's content.
   3) No final action, such as form submission or purchase, was recorded in this log file, but the sequence of events indicates that the user's session is a conversion rather than a drop-off due to the exploration and navigation through different parts of the application.
