 Tag: Session is a Conversion
   1) The user clicked on the "Customer Login" button, indicating an intent to log in.
   2) After clicking the login button, no further actions were recorded that suggest a drop-off or abandonment.
   3) The subsequent interactions involve entering a username and password, which are typical steps for a successful login process.
   4) The user's interaction with the username and password fields suggests continued engagement, indicating they are likely attempting to complete the login process.
   5) Since no evidence of drop-off or abandonment was found, and the user appears to be actively engaged in the login process, it is reasonable to conclude that this session resulted in a conversion (successful login).
