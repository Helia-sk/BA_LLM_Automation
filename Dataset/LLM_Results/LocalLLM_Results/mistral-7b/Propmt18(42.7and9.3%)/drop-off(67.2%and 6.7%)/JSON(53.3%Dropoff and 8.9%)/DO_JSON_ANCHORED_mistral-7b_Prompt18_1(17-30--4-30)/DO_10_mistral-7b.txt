==================================================

 Tag: Session is a Conversion
   1) The user clicked on the "Customer Login" link, indicating an intention to start a login session.
   2) After clicking the "Customer Login" link, the user navigated to the username input field and then started typing, which suggests they are providing their username.
   3) Subsequently, the user clicked on the username input field, possibly to focus it or enter data. This action could be considered as continuing the login process.
   4) After focusing the username input field, the user typed "User", followed by "User" again, and then "User1". These actions indicate that the user is likely entering their username.
   5) The user then clicked on the password input field, suggesting they are preparing to enter their password. This action further reinforces that the user is continuing with the login process.
   6) Finally, the user clicked on the password input field again, possibly to focus it or begin entering their password. At this point, the user has taken all necessary steps for a successful login and appears to be completing the login process. Therefore, it can be reasonably assumed that this session was a conversion (i.e., the user successfully logged in).
