==================================================

 Tag: Drop-off
   1) The user first clicked on the "Restaurant Login" link, indicating an attempt to access the restaurant login page. However, there is no subsequent action suggesting that a login was actually performed or any further interaction with the website after this click event.

   2) After clicking on the "Restaurant Login", the user scrolled down the page. This could indicate the user is exploring the page, but it does not necessarily mean they are actively trying to log in at this point.

   3) The user then clicked on the "Customer Login" link, which is unexpected since they were previously attempting to access the restaurant login. This action may suggest confusion or exploration of other options, but again, it does not indicate a successful login or any further interaction with the website.

   4) Finally, the user scrolled down the page again without performing any other actions that would suggest a conversion (such as submitting a form). The lack of subsequent interaction and the unrelated click on "Customer Login" lead us to conclude that this session was likely a drop-off rather than a conversion.
