 Tag: Conversion
   1) The user clicked on the "Restaurant Login" link, indicating they are intending to log in.
   2) The user then clicked on the username input field, suggesting they are preparing to enter their login credentials.
   3) Subsequent clicks and interactions indicate that the user is typing in their username and password, which further supports the idea of a login attempt.
   4) Finally, the user successfully enters their username (shown by the change in "inputValue" from "" to "User") and proceeds with the login process.
   While we cannot definitively confirm that the user's login was successful without additional information, their interactions suggest that they have not abandoned the session but are actively engaging in a login attempt, which indicates a conversion.
