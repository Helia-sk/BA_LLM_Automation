 Tag: Drop-off

   Reason: The user did not enter any data in the password field or perform an action that would indicate a successful login, such as clicking on the "Dashboard" link. Instead, the user clicked on the "Customer Login" button multiple times and then clicked away from the page without taking any further actions that suggest a conversion.

   1) The user first arrived at the "/customer/login" page by clicking the "Customer Login" link.

   2) The user then clicked on the "Username" input field but did not enter any data.

   3) The user next clicked on the "Password" input field but again did not enter any data.

   4) The user clicked on the "Password" input field multiple times, indicating some level of interaction with that field, but still no data entry.

   5) The user then clicked away from the page by clicking on the "Customer Login" button multiple times without taking any further actions.

   6) No subsequent actions were recorded in the log file after this point, suggesting that the user did not complete a successful login or proceed to the dashboard. This sequence of events indicates a drop-off rather than a conversion.
