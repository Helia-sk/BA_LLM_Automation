 Tag: Drop-off
   1) The user landed on the homepage and scrolled down (log entry #10 and #9).
   2) The user clicked on a link to navigate to the "customer/login" page (log entry #8).
   3) After logging in, the user navigated back to the main page (log entry #7) without any further interaction.
   4) No other actions that indicate a conversion (such as placing an order or making a purchase) were recorded in this session.
   Since there was no evidence of a conversion, it appears this session represents a drop-off.
