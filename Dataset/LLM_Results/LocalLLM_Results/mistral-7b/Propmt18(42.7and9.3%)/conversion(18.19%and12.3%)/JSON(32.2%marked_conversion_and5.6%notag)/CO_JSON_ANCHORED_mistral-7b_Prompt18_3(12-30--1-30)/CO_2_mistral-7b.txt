==================================================

 Tag: Session is a Conversion
   1) The user clicked on the "Customer Login" link, indicating they are intending to log in.
   2) After clicking the "Customer Login" link, the user navigated to the customer login page.
   3) On the customer login page, the user interacted with the username input field by clicking it (indicating focus).
   4) The user then entered their username into the username input field and triggered a debounced onChange event.
   5) The user also clicked on the "Already have an account? Sign in" link but this is typically a navigation to recover password or register, not a drop-off action since they are still on the login page.
   6) Finally, the user submitted their login details by clicking the submit button, indicating a successful login and conversion.

This sequence of actions suggests that the user successfully logged in, thus it is considered a conversion.
