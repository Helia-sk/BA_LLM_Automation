==================================================

 Tag: Drop-off

   Reason: The user did not complete any action that could be considered a conversion, such as making a purchase or filling out a form. Instead, the user navigated through various pages (dashboard, history), but no interaction with elements on those pages indicating intent to convert was observed. Additionally, there is an event of "View Details" which might indicate interest, but it does not lead to any other action that would complete a conversion. The user eventually left the site by closing or navigating away from the page, as indicated by the last event being a page view.

   1) Identified the sequence of events in the log file:
       - User visited the dashboard (page_view).
       - User clicked on "History" (click).
       - User viewed details for an item (click).
       - User rejected an item by clicking "Reject" (not found in the log, but can be assumed as there is no subsequent action indicating acceptance or purchase).
       - User closed/navigated away from the page (page_view).

   2) Analyzed the sequence of events:
       - The user started by visiting the dashboard and clicking on "History". This could indicate interest in the restaurant's history.
       - The user viewed details for an item, but did not make any subsequent action that would lead to a conversion. Instead, the user rejected the item (assumed).
       - The user eventually left the site without completing any other actions.

   3) Conclusion: The session was a drop-off since there was no conversion event observed in the sequence of events analyzed.
