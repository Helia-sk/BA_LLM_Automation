==================================================

 Tag: Drop-off
   1) The user landed on the homepage ("/") and scrolled down. However, they didn't interact with any elements that would typically indicate intent to navigate to the login page ("/customer/login").
   2) The user did not trigger any events associated with filling out a form or initiating a login process (e.g., clicking on the "Customer Login" button or entering text into the username or password fields).
   3) The user did not return to the "/customer/login" page after scrolling, suggesting they may have lost interest or left the site.
   Overall, the lack of interaction with the login elements and no subsequent activity indicates that this session was a drop-off.
