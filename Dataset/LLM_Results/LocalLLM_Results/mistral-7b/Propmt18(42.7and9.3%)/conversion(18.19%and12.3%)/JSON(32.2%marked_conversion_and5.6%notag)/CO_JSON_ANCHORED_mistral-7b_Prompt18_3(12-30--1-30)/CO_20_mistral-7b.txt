 Tag: Drop-off

  1) The user first clicks on the link to access the login page, suggesting they are interested in logging in or signing up. However, they do not interact with any of the form fields such as username or password.

  2) The user does not click on the "UsernamePasswordSign In" button, which is a crucial step for a conversion since it indicates an attempt to log in or sign up.

  3) Instead, the user clicks on a link encouraging them to order food from local restaurants, indicating they might be interested in that service but not necessarily the login process.

  4) The user does not interact with the form again, suggesting they have dropped off from the intended conversion path (login/signup).

  5) There is no subsequent interaction that suggests a successful login or sign-up, further supporting the drop-off decision.
