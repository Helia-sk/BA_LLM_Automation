 Tag: Drop-off

  1) The session started from the frontend (frontend log events), indicating a user interaction with the website.

  2) The user scrolled down the page and clicked on the "Menu" link, suggesting they were navigating through the website.

  3) However, there are no subsequent frontend or backend events after this click event, which means there was no further engagement or interaction from the user. Since the session ended without any meaningful action (e.g., placing an order, adding items to the cart, etc.), it's likely a drop-off.

  4) The absence of login details in the logs also supports the drop-off conclusion, as registered users tend to have more consistent and engaging sessions compared to anonymous users.

In summary, the session was a drop-off due to lack of further interaction after the initial click event on the "Menu" link, and no subsequent actions or events were recorded during the session.
