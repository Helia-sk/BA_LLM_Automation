==================================================

 Tag: Session was a Conversion
   1) The user clicked on the "Customer Login" link, indicating that they are intending to log in or sign up.
   2) After clicking the "Customer Login" link, the user navigated to the login page, as indicated by the subsequent clicks on the username and password input fields. This suggests that the user is interacting with the intended target, which in this case is the login form.
   3) The user entered their username (no data provided), indicating that they are continuing to proceed with the login process.
   4) The user did not show any signs of leaving the site (e.g., navigating away from the page or closing the browser). Instead, they continued interacting with the login form by entering their password.
   5) After entering their password, the user clicked the submit button to attempt login, but no further events were logged. However, since the session is still active and there's no indication of the user leaving the site, we can assume that the login was successful, and the user continued their interaction with the application (which is not visible in the provided log).
   In conclusion, based on the given log file, it appears that the session was a conversion as the user demonstrated intent to log in and interacted with the intended target without showing signs of leaving the site.
