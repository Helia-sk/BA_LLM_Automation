==================================================

 Tag: Drop-off
   1) The user clicked on the "Customer Login" button, indicating they are attempting to log in.
   2) After clicking the login button, there is no subsequent activity indicating a successful login or any other action that would lead to a conversion (e.g., making a purchase, filling out a form, etc.).
   3) The last event in the log shows the user clicking on the "Customer Login" button again, suggesting they may have clicked by mistake or encountered an issue with the login process.
   This pattern of behavior indicates that the session was likely a drop-off, as the user did not complete any action that would result in a conversion.
