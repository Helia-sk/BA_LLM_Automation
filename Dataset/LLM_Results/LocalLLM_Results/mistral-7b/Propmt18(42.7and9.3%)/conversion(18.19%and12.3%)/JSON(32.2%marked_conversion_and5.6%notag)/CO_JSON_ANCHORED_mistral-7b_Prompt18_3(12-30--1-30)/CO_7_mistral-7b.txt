 Tag: Conversion

  1) The user clicked on the "Customer Login" link, which indicates an intent to log in.

  2) After clicking the "Customer Login" link, the user navigated to the login form. This is a normal behavior for a conversion event.

  3) The user interacted with the login form by clicking the username input field, suggesting they are preparing to enter their credentials.

  4) The user clicked the password input field, further confirming their intention to log in.

  5) After entering their credentials, the user clicked the submit button, which would typically initiate the login process. However, no subsequent logs indicate a failed login or drop-off event.

  6) Absence of any error messages, drop-offs, or unexpected actions after the submission suggests that the login was successful and the session is likely a conversion.
