==================================================

 Tag: Drop-off

  1) The user first navigated to the Menu Items page and scrolled through the available options.
  2) However, the user did not interact with any of the item cards (Starters, Main Courses, Desserts, Drinks, or Side Dishes) in a way that indicates adding an item to the cart or making a selection.
  3) The user clicked on the "Add Item" button, but this action does not necessarily indicate a conversion since no actual item was added to the cart.
  4) After clicking "Add Item", the user clicked on the "All Items" link, suggesting that they might be browsing further for items to add.
  5) The user then clicked an SVG icon without any discernible action or interaction associated with it in the log file, making it difficult to determine its purpose.
  6) The session ended without any additional interactions indicating a completed transaction or adding an item to the cart, leading to the conclusion that this was a drop-off session.
