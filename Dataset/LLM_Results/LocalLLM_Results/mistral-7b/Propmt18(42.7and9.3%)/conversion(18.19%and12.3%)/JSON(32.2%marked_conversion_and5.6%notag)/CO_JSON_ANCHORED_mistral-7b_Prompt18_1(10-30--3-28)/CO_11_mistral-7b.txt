 Tag: Drop-Off
   1) The user navigated to the customer dashboard page at timestamp "2025-09-13T14:37:56.450Z" and scrolled down the page, as indicated by multiple scroll events with varying scrollY values. However, there is no subsequent interaction or navigation indicating an action taken on the page.
   2) The user then continued to scroll up and down on the page for several more minutes (from timestamps "2025-09-13T14:37:55.386Z" to "2025-09-13T14:37:54.528Z"), again without any subsequent interaction or navigation suggesting a conversion event occurred.
   3) The user's final scroll event was at timestamp "2025-09-13T14:37:54.528Z", after which there are no further events in the log file, indicating that the user did not take any additional actions on the site and likely navigated away from it, suggesting a drop-off occurred.
