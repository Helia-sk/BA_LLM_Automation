==================================================

 Tag: Drop-off

  1) The user navigated to the "/customer/login" page (indicating an attempt to log in), but did not perform any actions that would typically be associated with a successful login, such as entering a username or password and submitting the form.

  2) After clicking the "Customer Login" button, no further interactions were recorded, suggesting that the user may have left the page without completing the login process.

  3) The last action in the log file is a page view of the homepage ("/"), which could indicate that the user navigated away from the site after attempting to log in and not returning.

In conclusion, the session appears to be a drop-off because the user attempted to login but did not complete the process or engage in any other actions on the site.
