 Tag: Drop-off
   1) The user navigated to the login/registration page from the dashboard, indicating an intent to access the platform.
   2) The user clicked on the "Restaurant Partners" link, suggesting exploration of options within the platform.
   3) The user then interacted with the username input field by clicking on it, which could be a sign of attempting to log in or register. However, no further action was taken after that.
   4) After that, there is no evidence of any subsequent interactions or actions that would indicate a successful login or registration, such as accessing the dashboard or placing an order.
   5) The final interaction shows that the user navigated away from the platform, which often indicates a drop-off in a user journey.

The lack of further engagement after initial interactions suggests that this session was likely a drop-off, as the user did not complete their intended action (logging in or registering).
