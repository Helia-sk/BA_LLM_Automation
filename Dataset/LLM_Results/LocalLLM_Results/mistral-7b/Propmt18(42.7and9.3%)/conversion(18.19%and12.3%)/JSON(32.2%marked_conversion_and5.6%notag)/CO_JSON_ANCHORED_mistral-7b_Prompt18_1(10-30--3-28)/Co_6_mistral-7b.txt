==================================================

 Tag: Drop-off

  1) The user clicked on the "Customer Login" link, indicating they navigated to the customer login page.

  2) After that, the user interacted with the form by clicking on the form itself and the username input field, which suggests they intended to fill out the form.

  3) However, the user did not provide any input in the username field or click the submit button, indicating an intention to proceed but no actual submission of a login attempt.

  4) The session ended without any further interaction, suggesting a drop-off rather than a conversion as the user did not complete the intended action (logging in).
