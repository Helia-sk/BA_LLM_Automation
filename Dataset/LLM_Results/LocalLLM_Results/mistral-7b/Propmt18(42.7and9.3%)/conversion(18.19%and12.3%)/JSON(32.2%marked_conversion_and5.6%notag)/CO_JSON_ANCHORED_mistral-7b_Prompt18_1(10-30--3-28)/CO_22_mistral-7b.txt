==================================================

 Tag: Drop-off
   1) The user clicked on the "Restaurant Partners Register your restaurant or log in to manage orders" link, indicating that they may be a potential new user.
   2) However, the user did not proceed with registering or logging in, but instead clicked on the "Register your restaurant" option. This suggests that their intention was initially to access the login page rather than to register a new restaurant.
   3) The user then entered a username ("User1") and clicked on the username input field again, which is typically associated with editing or focusing the field, not logging in or submitting the form.
   4) Finally, the user clicked on the username input field once more without entering any password, which is not consistent with a successful login attempt.
   Therefore, it appears that this session was a drop-off, as the user did not complete either the registration or login process.
