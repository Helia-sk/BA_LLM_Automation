 Tag: Conversion

  1) The user navigated to the Customer Login page (indicated by the click event on the "Customer Login" link).

  2) The user clicked on the username input field, which suggests they are preparing to enter their username.

  3) The user then clicked on the password input field, indicating they are ready to enter their password.

  4) The user clicked on the username input field again (possibly to correct something or re-focus it), followed by clicking on the form itself, which is a common action before submitting a form.

  5) Although no explicit submit event was recorded, the sequence of actions suggests that the user likely submitted the form, thus completing the login process and converting. The absence of a submit event could be due to an oversight in logging or the use of client-side form validation and submission.
