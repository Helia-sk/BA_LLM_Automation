 Tag: Conversion

  1) The user clicked on the "Menu" link, indicating they navigated to the menu page.

  2) The user then clicked on an item to add it, suggesting they are interested in interacting further with the application.

  3) There is no evidence of the user leaving the site (drop-off), as subsequent interactions continue within the session.

The sequence of events indicates that this session represents a conversion rather than a drop-off, since the user navigated to the menu, selected an item for addition, and there was no clear indication of leaving the site during this session.
