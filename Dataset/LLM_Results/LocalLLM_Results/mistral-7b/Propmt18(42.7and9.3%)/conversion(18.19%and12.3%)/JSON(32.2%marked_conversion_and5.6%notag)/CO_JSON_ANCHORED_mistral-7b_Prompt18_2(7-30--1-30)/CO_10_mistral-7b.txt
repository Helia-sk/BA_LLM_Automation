 Tag: Drop-off

1) The user clicked on the "Balance" link to navigate to the Balance page, indicating they might be interested in checking their account balance.
2) However, there is no further interaction or action that suggests the user continued with a purchase or completed any other significant action on the website.
3) After clicking the "Balance" link, there are no subsequent clicks related to product pages, cart, or checkout process.
4) The last click was on the "Orders" link, which is not typically a conversion event as it takes the user to their order history rather than a product purchase page.
5) No interactions were observed that indicate the user made a purchase or completed any other significant action before leaving the site.
6) Therefore, based on the available data in this log file, it appears that the session was a drop-off since there is no evidence of a conversion event taking place.
