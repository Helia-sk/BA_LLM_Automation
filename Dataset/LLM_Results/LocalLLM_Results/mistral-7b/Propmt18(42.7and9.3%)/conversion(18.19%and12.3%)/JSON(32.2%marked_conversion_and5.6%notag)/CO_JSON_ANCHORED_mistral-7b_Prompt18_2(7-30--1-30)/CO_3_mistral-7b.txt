 Tag: Conversion
   1) The user clicked on the "Restaurant Login" link, indicating that they intend to proceed with the login process.
   2) After clicking the "Login" link, the user entered their username (User1) in the username input field. This action is a positive sign as it shows the user is actively engaging with the site.
   3) The user then clicked on the username input field again, which suggests they may have been typing or correcting their input. This behavior is common during the login process.
   4) Finally, the user entered the same username (User1) in the username input field again, but this time, it was not accompanied by any click event. This could mean that they finished typing their username and are now ready to enter their password or submit the form.
   Overall, the sequence of actions suggests that the user is actively trying to log in, which indicates a conversion. The absence of subsequent actions such as clicking on the login button does not necessarily mean a drop-off, as it could simply mean the user has finished entering their credentials and is waiting for the site to respond or authenticate them.
