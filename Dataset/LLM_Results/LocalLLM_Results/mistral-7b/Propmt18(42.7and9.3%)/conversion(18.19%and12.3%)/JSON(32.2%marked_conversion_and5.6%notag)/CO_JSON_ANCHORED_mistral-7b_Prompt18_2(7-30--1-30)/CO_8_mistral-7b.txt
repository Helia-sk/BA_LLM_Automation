==================================================

 Tag: Drop-off
   1) The user visited the Customer Login page (indicated by the click event on the "Customer Login" link).
   2) The user clicked on the username input field but did not enter any information, which suggests that they may have been preparing to enter their credentials.
   3) The user then clicked on the password input field, but again did not enter any information, indicating that they might have been intending to complete the login process.
   4) However, the user never clicked on the "Login" button or performed any action that would indicate a successful login attempt, suggesting that they left the page without completing the intended action (i.e., logging in). As such, this session appears to be a drop-off.
