 Tag: Conversion

  1) The user initially landed on the homepage ("/customer/dashboard") and navigated to the "Restaurants" section by clicking the corresponding link.

  2) After that, the user clicked on a specific restaurant from the list, which is indicated by the click event on "/customer/dashboard/restaurant/<id>".

  3) Finally, the user interacted with the restaurant's details (clicking on the image and scrolling down to view it), and performed the conversion action by clicking the "Add to Cart" button. This can be inferred from the click event on "/customer/dashboard/restaurant/<id>" followed by interactions with elements related to the restaurant's details.

  4) The user then navigated away from the restaurant page, which suggests they proceeded to checkout or review their cart, as indicated by the scroll event on "/customer/checkout" and subsequent actions.

The sequence of events indicates that the user completed a conversion action (adding an item to the cart), suggesting this was not a drop-off session.
