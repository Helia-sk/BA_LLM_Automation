1) Check the last event in the log file to determine if it's a page view or an interaction with a form or a button related to completion of a transaction.

2) In this case, the last event is a page view (`event_name`: `page_view`), which indicates that the user did not complete any transaction and navigated away from the site.

3) Since the user didn't interact with any form or button related to completion of a transaction, it can be inferred that this session was a drop-off.

Tag: Drop-off [User did not interact with any form or button related to transaction completion]
