==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   1) The user has clicked on the "Add Item" button, which suggests an intent to add a new item to the menu.
   2) However, after clicking the "Add Item" button, there is no subsequent action indicating that the user has successfully added a new item or navigated to another page where they could complete this action.
   3) The user's interaction with the page seems to end after clicking the "Add Item" button, as there are no further interactions recorded in the log file.
   4) Lack of any action that signifies completion of the intended task (adding an item) or engagement with other parts of the site suggests that this session was likely a drop-off.
