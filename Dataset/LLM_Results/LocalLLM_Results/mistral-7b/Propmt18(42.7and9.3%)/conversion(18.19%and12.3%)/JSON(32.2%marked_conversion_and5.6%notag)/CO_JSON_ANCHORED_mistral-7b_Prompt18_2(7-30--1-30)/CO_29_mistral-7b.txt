==================================================

 Tag: Drop-off
   1) The user has visited multiple pages (Dashboard, History, and History Details), but no transaction or purchase seems to have been made.
   2) The user has not interacted with the "View Order" button or any other clear indication of a transaction.
   3) The session ended without the user returning to the Dashboard page, which could indicate a drop-off. However, further analysis might be needed to confirm if the user was just exploring the site or truly abandoned it.
