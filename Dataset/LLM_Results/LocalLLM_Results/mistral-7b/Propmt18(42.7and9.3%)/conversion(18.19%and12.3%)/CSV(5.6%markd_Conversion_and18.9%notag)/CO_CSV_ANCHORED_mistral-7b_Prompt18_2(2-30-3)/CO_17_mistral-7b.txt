 Tag: Drop-Off

1) The session started at the dashboard page (/customer/dashboard). This indicates that the user first landed on this page.

2) The user then clicked on the "Restaurants" link, which took them to the Restaurant list page (/customer/dashboard/restaurant).

3) On the Restaurant list page, the user scrolled down, implying they were looking at the restaurant listings. However, there was no interaction with any of the restaurants or further navigation.

4) The user then clicked on a specific restaurant (/customer/dashboard/restaurant/9), but again, there was no further interaction. They only scrolled down to view the image and then left the page without clicking any other links.

5) After leaving the Restaurant page, the user did not navigate to any other pages. The last recorded action in the log file is a scroll event on the dashboard page, but this doesn't indicate any meaningful interaction as it was likely just a system scroll event when the page loaded.

Since the user did not perform any actions that typically indicate a conversion (e.g., adding an item to cart, making a purchase, etc.), and they left the site without further navigation after viewing a restaurant page, it is reasonable to conclude this session as a drop-off.
