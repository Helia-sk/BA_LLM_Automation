==================================================

1) Examine the sequence of events in the log file. The first entry shows a scroll event on the home page (`/customer/dashboard`) at timestamp `2025-09-13T14:37:56.450Z`.

2) Continuing through the log entries, we see multiple scroll events and click events on the restaurant page (`/customer/dashboard/restaurant/2`). The user clicks a button labeled "No image available" at timestamp `2025-09-13T14:38:32.977Z`.

3) After the click event, there are no further interactions recorded in the log file. However, we see scroll events on both the home page and restaurant page at different timestamps, indicating that the user may have navigated back to the home page.

4) Since the user clicked a button but did not take any additional action (such as submitting a form or making a purchase), it is likely that this session was a drop-off. The user showed interest by clicking the button but did not complete the desired action.

Tag: Drop-off
[Reason]: The user clicked on a button but did not proceed with any further actions, indicating a potential loss of engagement.
