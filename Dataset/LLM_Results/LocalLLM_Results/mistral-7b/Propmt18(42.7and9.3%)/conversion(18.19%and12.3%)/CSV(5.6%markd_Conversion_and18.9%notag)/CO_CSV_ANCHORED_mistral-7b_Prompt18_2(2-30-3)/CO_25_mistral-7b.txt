==================================================

1) Filter logs based on the log type: frontend and event_name: click
    - This will give us logs related to user interactions on the frontend.

2) Identify sessions with click events that lead to a new page (route change)
    - This will help us determine if a user navigated through multiple pages or left the site after landing on a specific page.

3) Count the number of click events for each session:
    - If there is only one click event, it could be considered as a drop-off since the user didn't interact with other elements on the frontend.
    - If there are multiple click events and the last event is not associated with a new page, it might indicate that the user navigated to another page but didn't perform any further interaction, which could also be considered as a drop-off.
    - If there are multiple click events and the last event is associated with a new page, it indicates that the user kept interacting with the site and thus can be classified as a conversion.

Let's analyze the provided log file:

1. Filter logs based on the log type: frontend and event_name: click
    - We have 3 logs that match our criteria (log_1758985435886_4l55g8a0y, log_1758985428126_s76qbxnch, and log_1758985431599_ioqmc3uaa)

2. Identify sessions with click events that lead to a new page (route change)
    - In our selected logs, there is only one session (session_1758984560651_foqjcq8xf) that has multiple click events and the last event leads to a new page (/restaurant/dashboard/menu).

3. Count the number of click events for each session:
    - The session_1758984560651_foqjcq8xf has 3 click events, and the last event leads to a new page, so it can be classified as a conversion since the user kept interacting with the site.
