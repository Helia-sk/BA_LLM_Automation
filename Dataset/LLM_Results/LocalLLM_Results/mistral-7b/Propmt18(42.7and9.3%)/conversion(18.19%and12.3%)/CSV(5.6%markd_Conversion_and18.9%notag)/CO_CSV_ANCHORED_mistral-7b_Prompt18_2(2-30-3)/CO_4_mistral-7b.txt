==================================================

1) Identify the user interaction events in the log file.
    - The first event is a click on the "Restaurant Login" link (log_1757772897799_nqzze9f9t). This indicates that the user has navigated to the login page.
    - Subsequent events are input changes in the username field (from log_1757772897799_nqzze9f9t to log_1757772902487_7szy86ycp). This suggests that the user is trying to input their username.
    - The last event is a click on the username field (log_1757772900702_79kr8ielg). This could mean that the user has either accidentally clicked or intended to submit the form.

2) Determine if there was a form submission (username and password entered, and then the login button clicked).
    - In this log file, we do not have any evidence of a password input event or a click on the login button. This suggests that the user did not complete the login process.

3) Based on the above analysis, classify the session as a drop-off.
   - Tag: Drop-off [The user navigated to the login page but did not complete the login process.]
