==================================================

1) The user first navigates to the Customer Login page (log_1758982001023_zzkgn108u).

2) After clicking the "Customer Login" button, the user is redirected to the login page, as indicated by multiple click events on the username and password fields (logs from _1758982001809_u5d0yu5q9 to _1758982003418_3owdv9ltz).

3) The user enters their username "User1" (log_1758982003418_miqid4ba6 and log_1758982003442_ttl3wdknm).

4) After the username input, there are multiple events of the user modifying their username input (debounced input events), suggesting they may be correcting a typo or changing the username. However, since no subsequent steps to enter a password or submit the form are logged, it appears that the user did not complete the login process.

5) The last event in the log file is the user clicking the "Customer Login" button again (log_1758982003418_miqid4ba6). This suggests a potential drop-off or reattempt, as the user did not proceed with entering their password.

Tag: Drop-Off [The user did not complete the login process after entering a username].
