==================================================

1) Analyzing the log file, we can observe the sequence of events starting from a page load (scroll event), followed by navigation to the login page for customers (click event on "Customer Login" button).

2) Next, we see multiple scroll events as the user interacts with the customer login page. However, there is no input or interaction recorded with the username or password fields, indicating that the user has not yet attempted to log in.

3) The session ends with a scroll event when the user leaves the login page and navigates away from the site (scroll event on the homepage). Since the user did not attempt to log in, this indicates a drop-off.

Tag: Drop-off [The user did not interact with the login fields before leaving the site].
