==================================================

1) Identify the user interaction events:
   - The user clicked on the "Settings" link (log_1758985242334_sdckpcitq).
   - The user navigated to the Settings page (/restaurant/dashboard/settings).
   - The user interacted with an input field (log_1758985244978_iwp6mwb31), but no subsequent input change or form submission events were logged.
   - The user clicked on an "Add" button (log_1758985244978_b96fzs7iv, log_1758985245310_9wkmcbqpu), but no subsequent interaction with the added element or form submission was logged.
   - The user interacted with another input field (log_1758985245310_oskul68ek) and entered a value, but no subsequent form submission was logged.

2) Determine the session type:
   - Since there were user interactions, such as clicking on links and inputs, but no form submission or subsequent interaction with the added element, it appears that this session represents browsing behavior rather than a conversion (i.e., the user did not complete a form submission).

Tag: Drop-off
Reason: The user interacted with various elements on the page but did not complete a form submission, indicating they left the site without taking the desired action.
