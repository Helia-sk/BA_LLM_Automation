 Tag: Drop-off
   Reason: The user navigated to the dashboard page but didn't perform any action that indicates a conversion, such as clicking on a specific item or making a purchase. Furthermore, the user closed the history page and then left the site without returning to any other pages. This sequence of actions suggests that the session did not result in a conversion.
   1) The user navigated to the dashboard page (log_1758986435792_vg05snfan).
   2) The user clicked on the "History" link (log_1758986443885_ebam3884s), indicating an interest in viewing order history but did not proceed to any specific history item.
   3) The user closed the history page by clicking the "X" button (log_1758986445667_767la5ed5).
   4) There is no subsequent action that indicates engagement or a conversion on any other page in the log file.
