1) Identify the user interaction events in the log file.
    - The user clicked on the "Restaurant Login" link (indicating intent to start a session).
    - The user entered their username ("User1").
    - The user clicked on the username input field and then entered the password input field, but no password was entered.
    - The user clicked on the password input field, indicating they might be intending to enter a password. However, no password was entered before leaving the site (drop-off).

2) Determine if this session was a drop-off or a conversion based on user interaction.
    - Since the user did not provide their password and left the site without completing the login process, this is considered a drop-off session.

Tag: Drop-Off [The user did not complete the login process by providing their password].
