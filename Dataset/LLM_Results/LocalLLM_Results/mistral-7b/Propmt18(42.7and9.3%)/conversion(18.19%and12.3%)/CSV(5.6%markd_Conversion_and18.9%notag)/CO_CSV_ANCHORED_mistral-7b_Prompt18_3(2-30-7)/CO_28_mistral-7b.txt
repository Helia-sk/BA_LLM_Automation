 Tag: Drop-off

   Reason: The user landed on the login page (log_1758985849032_pt9psc4kp, log_1758985849132_sm9gb6j5r, log_1758985849134_5na5ry90h), filled in the username and password fields (log_1758985849032_pt9psc4kp), clicked the Sign In button (log_1758985849132_sm9gb6j5r), but didn't submit a form (no log entry shows a successful form submission). Since the user didn't take any action beyond logging in, this session can be considered a drop-off.

   [Step 1] - User navigated to the restaurant login page.
   [Step 2] - User entered username and password.
   [Step 3] - User clicked on the Sign In button but didn't submit the form, resulting in a drop-off.
