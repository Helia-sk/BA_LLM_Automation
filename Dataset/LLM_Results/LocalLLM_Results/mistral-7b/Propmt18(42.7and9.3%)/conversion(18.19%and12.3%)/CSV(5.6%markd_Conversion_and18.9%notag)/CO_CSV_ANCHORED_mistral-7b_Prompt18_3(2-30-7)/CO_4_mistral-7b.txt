 Tag: Drop-off
   1) The user clicked on the Restaurant Login link, indicating an initial engagement.
   2) Subsequently, no further interactions (clicks or input changes) related to form submission were observed in the log file.
   3) The absence of a successful click event associated with the "Submit" button suggests that the user did not complete the form and submit their information.
   4) Since there is no evidence of any further interactions after the initial engagement, it can be inferred that this session resulted in a drop-off.
