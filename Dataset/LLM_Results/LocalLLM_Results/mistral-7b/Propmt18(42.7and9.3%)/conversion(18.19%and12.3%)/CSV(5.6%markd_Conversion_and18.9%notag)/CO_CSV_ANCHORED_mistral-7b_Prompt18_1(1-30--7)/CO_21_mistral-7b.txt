 Tag: Drop-off
   1) The session starts with a page view at the root ("/") of the application (log_1758984488691_bw420137b). This is usually the entry point for users, but in this case, there's no subsequent event indicating navigation to another page within the application.
   2) The user then clicks on a link labeled "Restaurant Partners Register your restaurant or log in to manage orders" (log_1758984492967_wkl55uo2j). This could be considered as interaction, but it doesn't lead to the login page or any other action that indicates a successful registration or login.
   3) The user interacts with the login form by clicking on the username input field (log_1758984493682_gt39cx9kn) and then the username input field again (log_1758984492967_wkl55uo2j). However, there's no subsequent event indicating that a username was entered or submitted.
   4) The user interacts with the login form by clicking on the username input field again (log_1758984493682_gt39cx9kn), followed by clicking on the password input field (not shown in logs), but there's no subsequent event indicating that a password was entered or submitted.
   5) The user interacts with the login form by clicking on the password input field (not shown in logs), but there's no subsequent event indicating that a password was entered or submitted.
   6) The user clicks on the username input field (log_1758984495159_bqmnudq5g) and then the password input field (not shown in logs), but there's no subsequent event indicating that a username and password were entered or submitted.
   7) The user clicks on the password input field again (not shown in logs), but there's no subsequent event indicating that a password was entered or submitted.
   8) There are no further events after the last interaction with the login form, suggesting that the user did not successfully log in or perform any other action within the application.

In conclusion, this session appears to be a drop-off as the user interacted with the login form but did not complete the process, and there were no subsequent interactions indicating engagement with other parts of the application.
