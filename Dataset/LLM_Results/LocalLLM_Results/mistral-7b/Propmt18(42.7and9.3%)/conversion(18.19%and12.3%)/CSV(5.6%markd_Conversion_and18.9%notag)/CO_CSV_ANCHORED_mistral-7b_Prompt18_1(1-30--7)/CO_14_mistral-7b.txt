==================================================

1) Identify the user interaction steps in the log file.
    - The user first clicks on the "Customer Login" link (log_1758982001023_zzkgn108u).
    - After that, the user enters a username ("User1") and clicks on the username input field twice (log_1758982003418_3owdv9ltz, log_1758982003442_hp1wjyel1).
    - The user then enters a password, but there is no such event in the log file (password input and click on login button are missing).

2) Determine if the session was a drop-off or a conversion based on the given information.
    - Since the user did not complete the login process by entering the password and clicking on the login button, this session appears to be a drop-off.

Tag: Drop-off [The user did not complete the login process.]
