    - User clicks on the username field ("Username") and then clicks on it again (indicating focus).
    - User types a character in the username field (debounced input event).
    - User types another character in the username field (regular input event).
    - User clicks on the password field.
    - User clicks on the username field again, but no further interactions are recorded.

2) Determine if this session was a drop-off or a conversion based on the observed user behavior.
    - The user initiated actions associated with logging in (clicked the login button and interacted with the username field), but no password input was detected, indicating an incomplete login process.

3) Conclusion: Tag: Drop-off [Insufficient user input for a successful login was observed].
