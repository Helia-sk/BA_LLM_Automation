==================================================

 Tag: Drop-off
   1) The user clicked on the "Customer Login" button, indicating an attempt to start a session.
   2) The user then clicked and entered their username, but no password was entered or submitted.
   3) After this, there is no further interaction from the user in the log file, suggesting that they may have left the page without completing the login process.
   This lack of subsequent activity after a failed attempt to enter a password implies that the session was likely abandoned (drop-off). However, it's important to note that this analysis assumes that the log file contains all relevant interactions and events during the session, which may not always be the case.
