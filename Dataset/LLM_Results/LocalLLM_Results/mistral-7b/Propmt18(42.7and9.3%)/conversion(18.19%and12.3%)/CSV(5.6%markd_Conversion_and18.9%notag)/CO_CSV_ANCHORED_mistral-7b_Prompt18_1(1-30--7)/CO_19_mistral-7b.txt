==================================================

1) Identify the user's action in the log file - The user initially navigates to the home page (`/`) and then clicks on the "Customer Login" button, indicating an intent to start a session.

2) Check for subsequent actions - After clicking the "Customer Login" button, there are no more logs suggesting further interactions with the application or submission of any form data.

3) Determine if it's a drop-off or conversion - Since we do not see any subsequent logs indicating that the user completed the login process or performed additional actions within the application, this session can be considered a drop-off. The user navigated to the home page and initiated a login attempt but did not proceed with the login process further.

Tag: Drop-Off [The user did not complete the login process]
