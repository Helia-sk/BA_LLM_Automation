 Tag: Drop-Off

1. The user initiated a login session by providing their username and password (log_1758985849032_pt9psc4kp, log_1758985849134_sm9gb6j5r).
2. After entering their credentials, the user clicked the "Sign In" button (log_1758985849132_se2my4qmv), indicating a successful submission of the login form. However, the subsequent logs indicate that the user did not complete any tasks on the "History" page (log_1758985849134_vaj1bttsz) or the "History" link was clicked but not followed, as suggested by log_1758985849132_se2my4qmv and log_1758985849032_s23rs0wo7.
3. The user did not proceed to any other pages, such as the "History" page or any other pages within the app, suggesting they abandoned the session.

Reason: The drop-off occurred because the user initiated a login but did not complete any tasks on the subsequent pages, indicating an unfulfilled session.
