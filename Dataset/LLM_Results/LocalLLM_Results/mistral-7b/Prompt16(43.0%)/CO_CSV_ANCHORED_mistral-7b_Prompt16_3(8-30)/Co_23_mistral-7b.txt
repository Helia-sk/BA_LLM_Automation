 Tag: Drop-Off

1. The user visited the restaurant dashboard page (/restaurant/dashboard/settings).
2. The user clicked on the "Settings" link to navigate to the settings page.
3. The user interacted with various input fields and buttons, indicating that they were trying to make changes in their account settings. However, the log shows that one of the initiated tasks (input change) was abandoned, as there is no subsequent log entry for a form submission or any other action that would complete this task.
4. After the input change, there are no further interactions recorded for the session, suggesting that the user either navigated away from the site or closed their browser without completing any additional tasks. Since one of the initiated tasks was abandoned, we classify this session as a drop-off.
