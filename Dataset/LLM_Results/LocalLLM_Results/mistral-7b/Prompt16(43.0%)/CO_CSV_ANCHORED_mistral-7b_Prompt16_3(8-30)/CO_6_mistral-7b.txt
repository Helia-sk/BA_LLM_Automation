 Tag: Drop-Off

1. The user initiates a session by navigating to the customer login page (log_1757773371689_3ak46jhcx).
2. The user clicks on the "Customer Login" button, indicating an attempt to start the login process (log_1757773372596_2oj0c59xu).
3. The user then clicks on the username input field (log_1757773373072_scoku9tbi). This action implies an attempt to enter their username.
4. However, no further actions related to entering a username or password were recorded in the log file, suggesting that the user abandoned the login process without completing it.
5. The last action recorded is a click on the username input field again (log_1757773373072_scoku9tbi), which might indicate an attempt to correct or re-enter their username, but no subsequent actions followed, confirming that the user dropped off during the session.

Reason: The session was a drop-off because the user initiated tasks (logging in) but did not complete them.
