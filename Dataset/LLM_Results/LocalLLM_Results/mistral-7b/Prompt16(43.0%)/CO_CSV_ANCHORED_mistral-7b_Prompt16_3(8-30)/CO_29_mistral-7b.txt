 Tag: Drop-Off

1. The user started by navigating to the "/restaurant/dashboard/balance" page, indicating an initial interest in checking their balance.
2. Next, the user moved to the "/restaurant/dashboard/history" page, suggesting a desire to view their transaction history.
3. In the "history" section, the user clicked on the "View Details" button for one of the transactions, indicating an intention to explore more details about that particular entry.
4. However, after clicking on the "View Details" button, no further actions related to completing that task were recorded in the log file. This suggests that the user might have been presented with additional steps or information that they found confusing or unnecessary, leading them to abandon the process.
5. Finally, the user clicked on the "X" button in the "history" section, indicating that they decided to close that particular view without completing any further actions.

Since one of the initiated tasks (viewing transaction details and potentially taking further action based on those details) was abandoned, the session can be classified as a drop-off. It is important to analyze why the user did not complete this task to improve the platform's usability and convert more users in similar situations.
