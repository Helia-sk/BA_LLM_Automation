==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off

1. The user initiates a session by navigating to the customer login page (log_1757772635942_8b03evpom).
2. The user clicks on the "Customer Login" button (log_1757772635942_8b03evpom), indicating that they want to proceed with the login process.
3. The user then clicks on the username input field (log_1757772641131_txuz0gaml), which is a common action during a login process, but this is not followed by any other actions related to entering the username or password, suggesting that the user may have navigated away from the page or decided not to proceed with the login.
4. The user clicks on a link labeled "Already have an account? Sign in" (log_1757772640076_ko6uzo7bv), which could suggest that they were exploring other options, but again, no further actions related to the login process are observed.
5. The user clicks on another link labeled "Sign up for an account" (not shown in the log), indicating that they may have been considering creating a new account instead of logging in. However, since we don't have enough information about the subsequent actions, it is not possible to confirm whether they completed this task.
6. The user does not perform any other actions related to the login or signup process, and the session ends.

Since the user initiated a task (login) but did not complete it, the session can be classified as a drop-off.
