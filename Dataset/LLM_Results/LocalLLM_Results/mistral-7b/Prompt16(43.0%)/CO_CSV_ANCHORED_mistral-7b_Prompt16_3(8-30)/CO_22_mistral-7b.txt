 Tag: Drop-Off

1. The user clicked on the "Restaurant Partners" link, indicating they were navigating to the restaurant registration or login page (log_1758985133183_ivi9skey6).
2. The user clicked on the username input field (log_1758985133860_n2e4t50oy) to start entering their username.
3. The user entered "User1" into the username input field and clicked away, presumably to continue with the form (log_1758985133183_dptsgwwpt). However, there is no subsequent log entry showing that the user continued with the password input or submitted the form.
4. The user clicked on the password input field (log_1758985135389_qr0zt2rti), but did not enter any text and instead abandoned the session (log_1758985133860_n2e4t50oy).

The user initiated tasks, but did not complete them, indicating a drop-off. The user likely intended to log in or register their restaurant, but failed to do so, possibly due to abandonment or encountering an issue during the process.
