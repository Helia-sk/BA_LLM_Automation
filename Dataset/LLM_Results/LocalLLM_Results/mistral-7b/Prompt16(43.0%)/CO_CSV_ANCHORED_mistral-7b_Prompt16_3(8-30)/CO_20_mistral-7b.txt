3. Next, the user clicked on the username input field (log_1758983200277_8oflhmi38), indicating they likely entered their username.
4. The user then clicked on the password input field (log_1758983200633_lvosg5oui).
5. Finally, the user clicked on the form again, which triggered a click event for submission (log_1758983200277_wsv6sd2o8), suggesting they submitted their username and password to sign in or register.
