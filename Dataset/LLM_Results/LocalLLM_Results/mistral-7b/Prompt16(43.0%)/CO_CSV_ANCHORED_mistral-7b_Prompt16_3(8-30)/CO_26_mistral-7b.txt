 Tag: Drop-Off

1. The user navigated to the restaurant's dashboard menu (log_1758985593634, log_1758985597527, log_1758985597816).
2. The user clicked on a button to add an item (log_1758985597816), indicating the intention to make a purchase.
3. The user navigated through the menu items, possibly considering different options (indicated by clicks on various menu items). However, there is no log entry showing the user clicking on the "Add Item" button again or proceeding to any other step that would indicate completion of the purchase process.
4. The user interacted with a drop-down list or an image uploader, suggesting further intention to add an item to the cart (log_1758985593634, log_1758985597527). However, without subsequent logs showing completion of the purchase process, it can be inferred that the user did not complete the task.
5. The user's session ended without any further interaction related to the purchase process (no additional logs showing clicks on buttons or other elements indicative of purchase completion).

Reason: The user initiated a task (adding an item to the cart), but did not complete it, as there are no subsequent logs indicating the completion of the purchase process. This indicates a drop-off session.
