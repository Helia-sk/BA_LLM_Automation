Prompt: Analyze the following log file. Determine if the session was a drop-off or a conversion.Consider every initiated task, A task counts as a conversion only if it is fully completed. If all initiated tasks are completed → Tag: Conversion. If even one fo the  initiated tasks are abandoned → Tag: Drop-Off. Provide a reason for your classification. Then, outline the user journey step-by-step.Format your response as follows:
Tag: Conversion || Drop-Off ||  [Reason].
1. [Step 1]
2. [Step 2]
3. [Step 3] …
==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off

Reasons for the classification: The user initiated an HTTP request to access the menu page (`/api/menu/`) but did not complete any tasks within a short timeframe. Specifically, the following events were recorded:

1. An HTTP request was made at `2025-09-27T17:03:48.136616` for the menu page (`/api/menu/`). This indicates that the user accessed the menu page, which is the first step in this session.

2. An HTTP response was received at `2025-09-27T17:03:48.147457`, but no further events followed. The absence of any subsequent events indicates that the user did not interact with or complete any tasks on the menu page, suggesting that they abandoned their interaction and ended the session.

The lack of completed tasks in this session demonstrates that the user did not engage fully and ultimately left the application without completing a conversion (such as placing an order). Therefore, this session can be classified as a drop-off.

User Journey step-by-step:
1. The user accessed the menu page (`/api/menu/`) at `2025-09-27T17:03:48.136616`.
2. No further events were recorded, indicating that the user did not interact or complete any tasks on the menu page.
3. The session ended without a conversion due to user inactivity and/or abandonment.
