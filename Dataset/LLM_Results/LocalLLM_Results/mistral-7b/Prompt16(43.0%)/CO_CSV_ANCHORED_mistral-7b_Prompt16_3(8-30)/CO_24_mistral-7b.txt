==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off

1. The user visited the restaurant's dashboard (/restaurant/dashboard/menu) at time 2025-09-27T15:02:xx.
2. The user clicked on the "Menu" link, navigating to the same page but possibly showing a different section of the menu (/restaurant/dashboard/menu). This could be considered as Step 1 of the user journey.
3. The user interacted with various click events such as clicking on an SVG element and a form element. These interactions suggest that the user was exploring the menu items, possibly looking for something specific to order (Step 2).
4. However, the user did not complete any tasks such as uploading an image for an item or clicking on the "Save Changes" button. Instead, they stopped interacting with the page after clicking on a form element at time 2025-09-27T15:xx:xx (Step 3).
5. Since the user did not complete any tasks and abandoned the session, it can be classified as a drop-off. The reason for this classification is that the user initiated an action (exploring the menu) but did not complete it by making a selection or placing an order.

The user journey can be summarized as follows:
1. The user visited the restaurant's dashboard and navigated to the menu page.
2. The user explored the menu items, possibly looking for something specific to order.
3. The user stopped interacting with the page without completing any tasks or placing an order, resulting in a drop-off.
