 Tag: Drop-Off

1. The user initiated a session by navigating to the customer login page (log_1757772472157_i2mznptqp).
2. The user clicked on the "Customer Login" link, indicating an intent to log in (log_1757772473391_o1b6b8hlb).
3. The user then clicked on the username input field, suggesting they intended to enter their username (log_1757772475335_8x72t0r7f).
4. Subsequently, the user clicked on the password input field, indicating their intent to enter their password (not logged in this log file)
5. However, the user did not proceed to complete the login process, as there are no subsequent logs showing them entering a username or password and clicking the "Login" button. This indicates that they abandoned the session without logging in.

The drop-off occurred because the user initiated tasks (clicking on the input fields) but did not complete those tasks by entering their credentials and clicking the "Login" button.
