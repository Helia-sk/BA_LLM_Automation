 Tag: Drop-Off

The session was a drop-off because the user initiated a task (viewing order details) but did not complete it. The user clicked on the "View Details" button for order #21, but there is no subsequent log showing that they actually viewed the details of this order.

User Journey:
1. [Step 1] The user accessed the restaurant dashboard history page (/restaurant/dashboard/history).
2. [Step 2] The user clicked on the "View Details" button for order #21, initiating a task to view the details of this order.
3. [Step 3] The user did not complete the task by clicking on any other log showing that they actually viewed the details of order #21. Instead, there are subsequent logs showing the user interacting with other elements (X button and Done button) on the same page, but no further logs indicating that they completed viewing the details for order #21.
