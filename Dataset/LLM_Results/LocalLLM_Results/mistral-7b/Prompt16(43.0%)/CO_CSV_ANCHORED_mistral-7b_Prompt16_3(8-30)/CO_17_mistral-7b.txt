 Tag: Conversion

1. The user initiated a session by navigating to the homepage (/customer/dashboard).
2. The user clicked on the "Restaurants" link, indicating an intention to browse restaurants.
3. The user then navigated to the restaurant page (/customer/dashboard/restaurant/9), likely to view specific details about a restaurant.
4. The user scrolled down the restaurant page, suggesting further interest in the content.
5. The user clicked on the image section of the restaurant page, which didn't have an image at that moment, but this action indicates that the user wanted to see more information or images about the restaurant.
6. The user scrolled back up the restaurant page, possibly re-reading or examining the details of the restaurant.
7. Finally, the user entered some notes in the "No Image available" section by clicking on it, which is an initiated task (inputting notes) that was completed based on the subsequent log entry.
8. The user then navigated to another restaurant page (/customer/dashboard/restaurant/) and entered more notes there, completing another initiated task.
9. Lastly, the user clicked the "Back" button to return to the cart page (/customer/cart), indicating a possible intention to add the selected restaurants to their cart or continue shopping. This action didn't count as a conversion because adding items to the cart wasn't shown in the log file, but it shows that the user was engaged and continued interacting with the application.

The user completed all initiated tasks (entering notes for two different restaurants), so this session was classified as a Conversion. The user showed clear interest in browsing and interacting with the restaurant details, and they took time to enter notes for multiple restaurants, demonstrating intent to use the platform for its intended purpose (managing and recording their dining experiences).
