1. The user initiated a scroll event (log_1757773012670_mp8atqp66) and navigated to the homepage (log_1757773013317_qjhw9th5q).
2. The user clicked on the "Customer Login" link (log_1757773015075_4wi4zz4v7), indicating an intent to log in.
3. After clicking the login link, no further events related to the login process were recorded, which suggests that the user may have left the page or closed the browser without completing the login process. As the login event was not fully completed, it is classified as a drop-off.
