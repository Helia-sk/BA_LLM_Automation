 Tag: Drop-Off

1. The user initiated the session by clicking on the "Customer Login" link (log_1757773780414_4g211r8g2).
2. The user navigated to the username input field (log_1757773797385_uwv7j47ib) and clicked on it, but did not interact with it further, suggesting that they may have decided against entering their username.
3. The user then clicked on the username input field again (log_1757773797833_uwv7j47ib), which is consistent with them reconsidering or double-checking their previous decision, but still did not interact with it further, indicating that they eventually abandoned the session.
4. The user clicked on the username input field again (log_1757773797385_uwv7j47ib), possibly out of confusion or a mistake, but once again did not interact with it further before leaving the page. This suggests that they may have been unsure about their next steps or encountered an issue, causing them to abandon the session.

The user initiated the task (logging in as a customer) but did not complete it, so this is classified as a drop-off. The user's actions indicate confusion, potential issues, or indecision, which led to the abandonment of the session.
