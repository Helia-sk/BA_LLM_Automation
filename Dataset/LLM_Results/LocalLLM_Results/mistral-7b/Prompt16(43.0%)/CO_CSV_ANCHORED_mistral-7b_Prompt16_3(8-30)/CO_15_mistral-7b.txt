 Tag: Drop-Off

1. The user initiated a navigation to the "/customer/login" page (log_1758982282530_ew7a529gr), indicating an attempt to log in as a customer.
2. The user clicked on the "Customer Login" button (log_1758982299417_vimywuxpt), which would typically lead to a form for entering login credentials.
3. The user then interacted with the username input field by clicking on it (log_1758982300242_lmwx4qaau). This suggests an attempt to enter a username, but no further interactions related to the username input were recorded in the log file.
4. The user clicked on the username input field again (log_1758982302837_uugm0ut74), which may indicate an error or confusion, as they would typically move on to enter a password after entering their username.
5. The user interacted with the username input field once more (log_1758982304835_cw6hjqkqr), but no subsequent interactions related to this task were recorded in the log file, suggesting that they abandoned the login process without completing it.

Reason: The user initiated a login attempt but did not complete all necessary steps (entering username and password) before abandoning the process, indicating a drop-off.
