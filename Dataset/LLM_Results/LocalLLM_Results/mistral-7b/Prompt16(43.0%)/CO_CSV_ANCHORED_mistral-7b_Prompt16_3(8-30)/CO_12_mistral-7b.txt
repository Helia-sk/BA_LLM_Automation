 Tag: Conversion

1. The user initiated a session by navigating to the menu page (log_1757835612743_w7mcyut72).
2. The user clicked on the "Add Item" button (log_1757835648113_kofsxnpde), indicating they intended to add a new item to the menu.
3. After clicking "Add Item", the user filled in the required fields for the new item, providing values for both the name ("Saladmix" - log_1757835661503_4rqr1qehf) and the quantity (not shown).
4. The user then clicked on the "Item" button to save the newly added item (not shown, but implied as it is not present in the logs that the user left the page without adding an item).
5. The user returned to the menu overview page by clicking on the "Menu" link (log_1757835660964_fvkqjz9lh) and performed another action, suggesting they remained engaged with the application.
6. Finally, the user clicked on an input field within the menu overview page (log_1757835666263_4rqr1qehf), which could be interpreted as either browsing or editing an existing item. In any case, this action indicates the session did not end immediately after adding an item, further demonstrating user engagement.

Reason: The user initiated and completed a task (adding an item to the menu) without abandoning it, making it a conversion rather than a drop-off.
