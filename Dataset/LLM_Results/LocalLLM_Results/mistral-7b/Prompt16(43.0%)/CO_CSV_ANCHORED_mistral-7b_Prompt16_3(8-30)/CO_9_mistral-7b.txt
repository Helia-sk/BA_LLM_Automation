 Tag: Drop-Off

1. The user initially lands on the homepage "/customer/dashboard" (log_1757773977591_3etisigwv).
2. The user clicks on the "Restaurants" button located at x=174 and y=123 (log_1757773981159_b1lbxr8pf) to navigate to a list of restaurants.
3. The user navigates to a specific restaurant page "/customer/dashboard/restaurant/4" (log_1757773978615_bwt5ki2v4).
4. On the restaurant page, the user scrolls down but does not interact with any other elements on that page (logs from log_1757773978718_dw1dc2kpq and log_1757773978615_bwt5ki2v4 indicate scroll events, but no click events).
5. The user then scrolls back up to the homepage "/customer/dashboard" (log_1757773977591_3etisigwv and log_1757773978718_b7os385j5) without interacting with any elements.
6. The user then scrolls down on the homepage but does not interact with any other elements (log_1757773981159_azghwnz7j and log_1757773978718_b7os385j5 indicate click events, but no further interaction or scrolling).
7. The user leaves the page without any further interaction (no subsequent logs after log_1757773981159_azghwnz7j).

The session is classified as a drop-off because the user initiated a task by navigating to a specific restaurant page, but did not complete it by interacting with any elements on that page or taking further actions. The user's interaction with the homepage after navigating to the restaurant page suggests they may have been exploring options but ultimately did not find what they were looking for or decided against continuing their search.
