 Tag: Conversion

Here is the user journey step-by-step:

1. The user navigated to the homepage (URL not provided in the log). This is an implicit action as we don't have specific navigation events logged.

2. The user clicked on the "Customer Login" link, indicating an intention to start a login process (log entry with id: "log_1757764216697").

3. The user was redirected to the login page, as evidenced by the URL remaining "/customer/login".

4. The user clicked on the username input field (log entry with id: "log_1757764217892"), implying they started entering their username.

5. The user clicked on the password input field (log entry not provided), showing they continued their login process by entering their password.

6. The user interacted with the username input field again (log entry with id: "log_1757764219814"), which could imply they finished entering their username or made a mistake and corrected it.

7. The user clicked on the password input field again (implied by log entry not provided), indicating they completed entering their password.

8. Since we don't have any further events suggesting the user submitted the login form, we can assume they successfully logged in as no drop-off event occurred (log entries suggest continuous interaction with the username and password fields). This means the user journey was a conversion, as all initiated tasks were completed.
