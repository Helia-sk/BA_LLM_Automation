 Tag: Conversion

The session was a conversion because all initiated tasks were completed. The user clicked on the "Restaurant Partners" link, navigated to the login/registration page (indicated by multiple clicks on the username input field), entered their username ("User1"), and then submitted the form (indicated by the username length changing from 0 to a non-zero value). This shows that the user completed the registration process.

Here is the user journey step-by-step:

1. The user clicked on the "Restaurant Partners" link to navigate to the login/registration page (log_id: log_1757766617577).
2. The user clicked on the username input field (log_id: log_1757766618638). This could have been an initial attempt to start the registration process or to access their existing account.
3. The user clicked on the username input field again (log_id: log_1757766617577_cr4q0wxnm), which might have indicated they were still deciding whether to register or log in.
4. The user clicked on the username input field once more (log_id: log_1757766621191). This could have been another attempt to start the registration process.
5. The user entered their username ("User1") into the username input field (indicating they decided to register) (log_id: log_1757766621191_h6hkqa012).
6. The user clicked on the submit button, completing the registration process (indicated by the username length changing from non-zero to 0) (log_id: log_1757766621191_h6hkqa012).
