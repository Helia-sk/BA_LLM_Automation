 Tag: Conversion

The session was a conversion because all the initiated tasks were completed. The user clicked on the "Customer Login" link, which led to the username input field being clicked twice (indicating the user entered their username), then the password input field was clicked twice (indicating the user entered their password). Finally, the login button was clicked, indicating a successful login.

Here is the step-by-step user journey:
1. The user clicked on the "Customer Login" link, initiating the login process.
2. The user moved to the username input field and clicked on it twice, suggesting they entered their username.
3. The user then moved to the password input field and clicked on it twice, indicating they entered their password.
4. Finally, the user clicked on the login button, completing the login process, which means this was a successful login and thus a conversion.
