 Tag: Drop-Off

Explanation: The user initiated the task of clicking on the "Restaurant Login" link, but did not complete the subsequent steps (entering a username and password) before leaving the page. Since one of the initiated tasks was abandoned, we can classify this as a drop-off.

User Journey:
1. The user navigated to the restaurant's login page by clicking on the "Restaurant Login" link. (Step 1)
2. The user clicked on the username input field but did not enter any text, indicating they may have intended to type their username there. (Step 2)
3. The user did not interact with any other elements on the page, implying that they did not enter a password or attempt to submit the form. (Step 3)
4. The user clicked away from the input field and did not return to the page, indicating that they left the page without completing the login process. (Step 4)
