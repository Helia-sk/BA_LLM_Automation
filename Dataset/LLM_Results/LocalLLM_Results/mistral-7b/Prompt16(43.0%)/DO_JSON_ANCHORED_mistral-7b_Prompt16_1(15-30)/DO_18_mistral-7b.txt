 Tag: Drop-Off

The session was dropped off because the user initiated the task of logging in or registering a restaurant, but did not complete it before leaving the page. This is evident from the sequence of events where the user clicked on the "Restaurant Partners" link and then clicked on the "Register your restaurant or log in to manage orders" link, indicating an intention to log in or register. However, there are no subsequent logs showing any attempt to actually enter login credentials or proceed with the registration process.

User Journey:
1. The user arrived at the Restaurant Partners page (indicated by the click event on the "Restaurant Partners" link).
2. The user clicked on the "Register your restaurant or log in to manage orders" link, indicating an intention to log in or register.
3. There are no subsequent logs showing any attempt to enter login credentials or proceed with the registration process, suggesting that the user left the page without completing the task.
