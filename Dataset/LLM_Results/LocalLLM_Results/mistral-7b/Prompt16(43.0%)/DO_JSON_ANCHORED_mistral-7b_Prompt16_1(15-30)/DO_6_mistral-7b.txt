 Tag: Drop-Off

1. The user first visited the homepage ("/") and scrolled down to an element (Step 1).
2. Next, the user clicked on a link ("Hungry? Order delicious food from local restaurants"), indicating that they were interested in ordering food (Step 2).
3. However, after clicking the link, the user did not proceed with any further actions related to placing an order or providing their details. Instead, they navigated back to the login page ("/customer/login") and performed various activities there (Steps 3-7).
4. Despite the user engaging on the login page for a while (Steps 3-7), they did not initiate any actions that could be considered completing the task of logging in or placing an order. Therefore, the initiated task (ordering food) was abandoned, indicating a drop-off.

Reason: The session dropped off because the user showed interest in ordering food by clicking on the relevant link but did not proceed with the task of placing an order or providing their details. Instead, they engaged in activities on the login page without completing any tasks that could be considered as a conversion.
