 Tag: Conversion

1. The user clicked on the "Customer Login" link, indicating that they have initiated a login process.
2. The user then proceeded to click on the username input field, suggesting that they are preparing to enter their credentials.
3. The user typed in "User", which is likely part of the username for the login process.
4. The user clicked on the password input field, indicating that they were preparing to enter their password. However, since there's no record of them typing anything in the password field, it's unclear if they actually entered their password or not.
5. The user did not interact with any other elements in the log, which suggests that they might have successfully logged in and continued with their intended actions (assuming correct credentials were provided).

The session was a conversion because the user initiated a login process and it appears that they successfully completed it based on the steps taken, even though we don't have direct confirmation that they entered the password correctly. The absence of further interactions could suggest that they proceeded to another page or performed actions not logged in this log file.
