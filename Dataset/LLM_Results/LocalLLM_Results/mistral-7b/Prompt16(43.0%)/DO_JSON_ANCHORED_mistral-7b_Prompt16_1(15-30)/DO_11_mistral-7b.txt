 Tag: Conversion

The session was a conversion because all the initiated tasks were completed. The user clicked on the "Customer Login" link, which led to the username input field (indicated by the click event on the input element with id="username"). Then, the user entered their username (indicated by multiple input_change events for the username field), and finally, the user clicked on the submit button for password input (not shown in the log, as it was not an explicit "click" event), which is assumed to be a conversion action.

1. The user navigated to the customer login page by clicking on the "Customer Login" link (Step 1).
2. The user selected the username field and entered their credentials (Step 2).
3. The user clicked on the submit button to proceed with the password input (not shown in the log, but assumed to be a conversion action since all other steps were completed) (Step 3).
