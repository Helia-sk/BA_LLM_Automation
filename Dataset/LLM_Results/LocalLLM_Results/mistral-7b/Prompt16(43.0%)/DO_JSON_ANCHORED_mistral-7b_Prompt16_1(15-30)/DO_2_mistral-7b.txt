 Tag: Drop-Off

1. The user first scrolled to the homepage (log_1757763606219_c2hwfdkf3).
2. The user then scrolled further down the page, implying they were exploring the content (log_1757763605641_i0oqvjrbd).
3. The user clicked on the "Restaurant Login" button (log_1757763609230_4tmfpch76), but did not proceed any further with the login process, indicating that they may have decided against logging in at this point.
4. The user then clicked on the "Customer Login" button (log_1757763607141_b94txzhvu), again without completing the subsequent steps of the login process.

The session was a drop-off because, although the user initiated two tasks (clicking on the Restaurant and Customer Login buttons), they did not complete any of these tasks, suggesting that they left the site without logging in.
