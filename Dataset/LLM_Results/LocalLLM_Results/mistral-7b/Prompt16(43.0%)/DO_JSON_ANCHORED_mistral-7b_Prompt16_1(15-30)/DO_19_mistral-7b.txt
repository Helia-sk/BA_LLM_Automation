 Tag: Drop-Off

The session was a drop-off because the user initiated the task of logging in or registering, but neither action was completed. The user clicked on the "Restaurant Partners" link and then clicked on the username input field, which suggests an intent to log in or register. However, there is no subsequent event that indicates the completion of this task.
