 Tag: Drop-Off

1. The user navigated to the Restaurant Login page (log entry with id "log_1757765650904_aczosynfv"). This is the initial step of the user journey.
2. The user clicked on the Restaurant Login button (log entry with id "log_1757765653032_k2omtefm6"). This indicates that the user initiated the login process.
3. The user clicked on the username input field (log entry with id "log_1757765654366_eutf57smh"). This is a step towards completing the login process by entering their username. However, it appears that the user did not complete this task as there are no subsequent log entries indicating the input of a username or password.
4. The user clicked on the username input field again (log entry with id "log_1757765653033_182oq2yy5"). This suggests that the user may have intended to correct an error or re-enter their username, but there are no subsequent log entries indicating the completion of this task.
5. The user did not perform any further actions after these initial interactions with the login form.

Since the user initiated the login process and did not complete it by entering a valid username and password, this session can be classified as a drop-off. The user journey consisted of navigating to the login page and attempting (but ultimately failing) to log in.
