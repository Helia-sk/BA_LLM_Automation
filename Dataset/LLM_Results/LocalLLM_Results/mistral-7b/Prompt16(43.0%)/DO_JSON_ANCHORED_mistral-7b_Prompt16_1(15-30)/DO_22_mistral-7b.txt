1. The user navigated to the Restaurant Login page from the dashboard menu (Log_1757766513269_1j1sua7jb).
2. The user clicked on the username input field (Log_1757766514090_yohkq9n2q). This could be considered as the first step towards entering a username, but no subsequent action to enter a username or password was recorded.
3. The user clicked on the username input field again (Log_1757766513269_1j1sua7jb), suggesting they might have intended to correct an entry, but no further actions were taken.
4. The user clicked on the password input field without entering any data (not shown in log). This could be considered as another step towards entering a password, but no subsequent action to enter a password was recorded.
5. No other actions related to the login process were recorded.

Reason: The user initiated the login process by clicking on the username and password input fields, but they did not complete it by entering their credentials or submitting the form. This indicates that they abandoned the process, classifying this session as a drop-off.
