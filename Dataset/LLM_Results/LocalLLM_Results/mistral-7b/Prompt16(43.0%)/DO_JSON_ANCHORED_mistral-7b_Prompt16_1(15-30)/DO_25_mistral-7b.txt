1. The user navigated to the Restaurant Login page (log event with ID "log_1757766826727_nc9nu1zz0").
2. The user clicked on the 'Restaurant Login' link (log event with ID "log_1757766826727_nc9nu1zz0"), indicating they initiated the login process.
3. The user clicked on the username input field (log event with ID "log_1757766827830_dlftq2kky"), suggesting they were preparing to enter their username.
4. The user clicked again on the username input field, this time to type in their username (log event with ID "log_1757766827830_xz1xlxgoo"). This indicates that they did start typing their username, which means the login process was initiated fully.
5. The user then clicked on the password input field (log event with ID "log_1757766830082_41gmqigpe"), implying they were preparing to enter their password.
6. The user typed in their password, completing the login process (log event with ID "log_1757766830082_41gmqigpe").
