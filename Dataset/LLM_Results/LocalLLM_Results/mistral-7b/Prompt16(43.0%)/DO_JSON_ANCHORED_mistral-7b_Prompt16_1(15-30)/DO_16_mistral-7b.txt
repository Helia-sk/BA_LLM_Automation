 Tag: Drop-Off

1. The user initiated a session by visiting the login page (log_1757765858753_hpphusaqe).
2. The user clicked on an SVG element, which could potentially be part of the login form or navigation (log_1757765857968_90p4enc6u). However, no further interactions related to the login process were observed.
3. No interactions related to the password input field were detected (no click or input event on the password field).
4. Since the user initiated a session but did not complete the login process, it can be inferred that they abandoned the session, indicating a drop-off.
