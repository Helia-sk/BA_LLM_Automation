 Tag: Drop-Off

1. The user visited the homepage ("http://localhost:5173/") and scrolled down.
2. The user clicked on a link inviting them to order food from local restaurants, but it seems like they did not proceed any further as there are no subsequent actions indicating navigation to the food ordering page or any other completed task related to ordering food.
3. The user navigated to the login page ("http://localhost:5173/customer/login") and entered their details (indicated by a "type" event, but no "submit" event was recorded). This suggests that they might have intended to log in, but again, there are no subsequent actions indicating successful login or completion of any other task.
4. The user scrolled on the login page and eventually left the site without performing any other action.

The session was a drop-off because the initiated tasks (ordering food and logging in) were abandoned. The user did not complete any task fully, indicating they navigated away from the site without performing the intended actions.
