 Tag: Drop-Off

Reason: The user initiated the login process by clicking on the "Username" input field and then entered their username ("User1"). However, they did not proceed to enter a password or click the "Login" button. Instead, they clicked on other elements on the page but did not complete any other tasks that would be considered part of the login process. Since the login process was not fully completed, this session can be classified as a drop-off.
