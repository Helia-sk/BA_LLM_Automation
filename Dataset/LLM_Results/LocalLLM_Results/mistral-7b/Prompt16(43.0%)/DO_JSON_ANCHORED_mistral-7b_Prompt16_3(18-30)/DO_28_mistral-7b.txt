 Tag: Drop-Off

The session was a drop-off because the user initiated the task of navigating to the "History" page, but did not complete it. They also navigated to the "Settings" page and interacted with the elements there, but there is no indication that they completed any tasks on that page either. Since all initiated tasks were abandoned, we can classify this session as a drop-off.

1. [Step 1] The user accessed the restaurant dashboard.
2. [Step 2] The user clicked on the "History" link to navigate to the history page, but did not complete any actions there (indicated by the click event, but no subsequent events).
3. [Step 3] The user clicked on the "Settings" link and interacted with elements on that page, but again, there is no indication that they completed any tasks there either.
4. [Step 4] The user left the application, ending the session.
