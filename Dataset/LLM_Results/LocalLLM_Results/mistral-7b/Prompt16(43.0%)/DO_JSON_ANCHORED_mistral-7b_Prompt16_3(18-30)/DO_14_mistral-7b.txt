1. The user visited the Restaurant Login page (Log_1757765650904).
2. The user clicked on the "Restaurant Login" link (Log_1757765650904), indicating they intended to log in.
3. Upon reaching the login form, the user did not enter any username or password, indicating they abandoned the login attempt (Log_1757765653032 and Log_1757765653033).
4. The user did not interact with any other elements on the page, such as clicking the submit button, suggesting that they left the page without completing the login process (Logs from 1757765650904 to 1757765654366).

The session was a drop-off because the user initiated the task of logging in but did not complete it. The reason for this could be due to various factors such as forgotten credentials, lack of intention to log in at that moment, or difficulty navigating the login form.
