 Tag: Drop-Off

1. The user first arrived at the homepage (session_1757763080934_tj3hw6dyl) and scrolled down to the "Hungry? Order delicious food from local restaurants" button, indicating an intention to interact with the site (Step 1).
2. The user clicked on the "Hungry? Order delicious food from local restaurants" button (Step 2), which would typically lead them to a different page where they could browse available food options, place orders, etc. However, this action seems to have been the last interaction recorded in the log file, suggesting that the user did not proceed with the intended action and left the site without completing any other tasks (Step 3).

The user's session ended without them completing a task that was initiated (placing an order), so it is classified as a drop-off. The reason for this classification is the absence of any recorded actions after clicking on the "Hungry? Order delicious food from local restaurants" button.
