 Tag: Drop-Off

The session was a drop-off because the user initiated tasks but did not complete them. In this case, the user clicked on the username input field and the "svg" element, but did not provide any input in the username field or password field (as there is no corresponding event for it), which indicates that the user abandoned the login process.

Here's a breakdown of the user journey:
1. The user navigated to the login page of the website (indicated by the first "click" event on the URL).
2. The user clicked on the username input field, suggesting they intended to enter their username (indicated by the second "click" event on the username input field).
3. The user moved the cursor to an SVG element, possibly intending to click a login button or navigate away from the page, but no corresponding action was taken (indicated by the third "click" event on the SVG element).
4. No further events were recorded, indicating that the user abandoned the session without completing the login process.
