 Tag: Conversion

The session was a conversion because all the initiated tasks were completed. The user first clicked on the "Restaurant Login" link (Step 1), then interacted with the username input field by clicking on it (Step 2), and finally, they typed in their username (not shown in the log). Since there is no indication that any task was abandoned during this session, we can conclude that the user successfully logged into the restaurant site.

1. The user clicked on the "Restaurant Login" link, initiating the login process.
2. The user interacted with the username input field by clicking on it, preparing to enter their username.
3. Although not shown in the log, we can assume that the user entered their username and completed the login process, successfully accessing the restaurant site.
