 Tag: Drop-Off

1. The user clicked on the "Customer Login" link (event_id: log_1757764445287_gmbnqmev1). This indicates that the user initiated the login process.

2. The user then clicked on the username input field (event_id: log_1757764446434_6b33zl4uy), which is a typical action when entering a username for login. However, no subsequent actions related to username entry or password entry were recorded.

3. The user then clicked outside the username input field (event_id: log_1757764448162_scuo3mqi9), which could suggest that the user decided not to proceed with the login process and left the page, as no further actions related to password entry or submission were recorded.

The reason for classifying this session as a drop-off is that the user initiated the login process but did not complete it. The user clicked on the username input field, but no subsequent actions related to entering a username or password were recorded. This suggests that the user either encountered an issue during the login process or decided not to continue with the login.

The user journey can be summarized as follows:
1. User clicked on the "Customer Login" link (event_id: log_1757764445287_gmbnqmev1).
2. User clicked on the username input field (event_id: log_1757764446434_6b33zl4uy).
3. User clicked outside the username input field, possibly indicating they did not proceed with the login process (event_id: log_1757764448162_scuo3mqi9).
