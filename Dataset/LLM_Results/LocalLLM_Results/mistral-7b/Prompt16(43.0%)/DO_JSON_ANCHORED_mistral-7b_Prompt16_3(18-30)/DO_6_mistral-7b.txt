 Tag: Drop-Off

1. The user first visits the homepage ("/") and scrolls down a bit, indicating an initial interest in the site (Step 1).
2. The user clicks on a link to navigate to the "customer/login" page (Step 2). This suggests that the user intends to sign up or log in for further interaction with the platform.
3. The user scrolls on the login page, but there is no subsequent event indicating that they actually logged in or initiated any other tasks on the platform (Step 3). Since the user's intended action of logging in was not completed, it can be inferred that they abandoned the site, making this a drop-off session.

The user journey for this session can be summarized as follows:
1. User visits homepage and scrolls down.
2. User clicks on a link to navigate to the login page.
3. User scrolls on the login page but does not complete any further action, indicating an abandoned session.
