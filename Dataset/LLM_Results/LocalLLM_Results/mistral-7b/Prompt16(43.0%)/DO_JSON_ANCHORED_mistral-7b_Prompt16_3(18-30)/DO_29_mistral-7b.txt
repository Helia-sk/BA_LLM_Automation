 Tag: Conversion

The session can be classified as a conversion because all the initiated tasks were completed in this case. Here is the user journey step-by-step:

1. The user clicked on the "Orders" link from the dashboard, indicating the beginning of the user journey (log #5).
2. The user then navigated to the "Menu" link within the "menu" section (log #6), which is a normal step as they are exploring the available options.
3. The user interacted with several elements on the "Menu" page, such as buttons and other interactive components, suggesting further exploration of the menu items (logs #7 to #9).
4. Finally, the user clicked the "Save" button on the "Menu" page, which is likely associated with saving changes or preferences related to the selected menu items (log #10). This action represents the completion of a task and the end of the user journey in this context. Since all initiated tasks were completed, the session can be classified as a conversion.
