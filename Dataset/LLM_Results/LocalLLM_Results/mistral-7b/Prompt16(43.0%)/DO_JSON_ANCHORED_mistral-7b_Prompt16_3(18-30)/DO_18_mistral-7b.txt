 Tag: Drop-Off

1. The user first clicked on the link to access the Restaurant Partners page (Log ID: log_1757766042310_6row8kfjv).
2. The user then clicked on the "Register your restaurant or log in to manage orders" text, which presumably would have led them to a registration/login form (Log ID: log_1757766043470_ybil8ie2m).
3. The user proceeded to click on the username input field of the potential login/registration form (Log ID: log_1757766042310_6row8kfjv and Log ID: log_1757766043470_ybil8ie2m).
4. The user then clicked on the password input field of the potential login/registration form (Log ID: log_1757766043470_ybil8ie2m).
5. However, the user did not complete any further actions that would indicate a successful registration or login. Instead, the session ended after these initial interactions with the username and password fields. As the user initiated a task (logging in/registering) but did not complete it, this is classified as a drop-off.

This user showed interest in logging into their restaurant account or registering a new one but ultimately abandoned the process without completing it, suggesting a drop-off session.
