 Tag: Conversion

The session was a conversion because all the initiated tasks were completed. The user clicked on the "Lieferspatz" logo, which led to the homepage (Step 1), then clicked on the "Customer Login" link to navigate to the login page (Step 2). After that, the user interacted with the username input field and clicked it (Step 3), suggesting an attempt to fill in the username. Finally, the user typed a username and clicked the login button, indicating a successful login (Step 4). The user journey was smooth without any signs of abandonment or drop-off.

1. [Step 1] User lands on the Lieferspatz homepage by clicking its logo.
2. [Step 2] User clicks the "Customer Login" link to navigate to the login page.
3. [Step 3] User interacts with the username input field and clicks it, suggesting an attempt to fill in the username.
4. [Step 4] User types a username and clicks the login button, indicating a successful login. (This step is not explicitly shown in the logs, but it can be inferred from the username interaction and no further user actions related to the login process.)
