 Tag: Drop-Off

The reason for classifying this session as a drop-off is that although the user initiated the task of navigating to the login page (indicated by the "Restaurant Login" click event), they did not complete the subsequent tasks required for a conversion, such as entering their username and password. The lack of any subsequent input or click events in the provided log file suggests that the user abandoned the session before completing the login process.

Here's a summary of the user journey:
1. Clicked on the "Restaurant Login" link (indicating the start of a new session).
2. Clicked on the username input field but did not enter any username (indicating an attempt to begin the login process).
3. [No further actions were recorded, suggesting that the user abandoned the session before completing the login process.]
