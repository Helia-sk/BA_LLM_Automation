==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off

Reason: The user initiated the task of navigating to the "Restaurant Login" page (Step 1), but did not complete the subsequent tasks, such as entering a username or password and clicking the "Login" button. Instead, the log shows that the user clicked on the username input field and the "Login" button without providing any data, which suggests that the login process was not completed. This indicates that the user abandoned the task of logging in, and therefore the session was a drop-off.

1. Step 1: The user navigated to the Restaurant Login page from the dashboard menu (/restaurant/dashboard/menu).
2. Step 2: The user clicked on the username input field and the "Login" button without providing any data. This action did not trigger a "click" event for the password input field or the "Login" button, suggesting that the user did not intend to enter a password or submit the login form.
3. Step 3: The user navigated away from the Restaurant Login page (/restaurant/login) without completing the login process, as evidenced by the subsequent page view for the homepage (/). This action indicates that the user abandoned the task of logging in and did not proceed to any further tasks.
