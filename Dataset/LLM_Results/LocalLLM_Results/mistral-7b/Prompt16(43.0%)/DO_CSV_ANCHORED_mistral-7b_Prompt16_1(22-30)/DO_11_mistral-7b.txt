 Tag: Drop-Off

1. The user initiated a session by navigating to the customer login page (log_1757765038386_ucc709vcf).
2. The user clicked on the "Customer Login" button (log_1757765038386_ucc709vcf), which would typically lead to a form for entering username and password. However, there is no subsequent log indicating that the user entered any text in either of these fields or attempted to submit the login form.
3. The last interaction was a click on the username input field (log_1757765039999_giwhtlzzw), but this does not count as a completed task since the user did not enter any data and did not attempt to submit the form.
4. There are no subsequent logs indicating that the user initiated or completed any other tasks, such as registering an account or resetting a password.
5. Since one of the initiated tasks (the login process) was abandoned without completion, this session can be classified as a drop-off.
