 Tag: Conversion

1. The user navigated to the homepage of the application from another page (/restaurant/dashboard/menu) indicating that they were already engaged with the application. This is the first step in the user journey.
2. The user clicked on the "Restaurant Login" link, initiating the login process.
3. The user clicked on the username input field and started typing their username (User1), showing intent to complete the login process. This is an indication that the user is actively engaged in the application.
4. The user clicked on the password input field and started typing their password, continuing the login process.
5. The user clicked on the username input field again, possibly to correct or modify their username entry. This could be interpreted as a minor delay, but it doesn't indicate abandonment of the process.
6. The user clicked on the password input field again, indicating that they are still actively typing their password. This continues to show intent to complete the login process.
7. The user clicked on the username input field once more, possibly due to a typo or change of mind regarding the username. However, they did not abandon the process as they continued typing in the password input field.
8. Finally, the user clicked the username input field one last time before clicking the password input field and submitting their credentials, successfully logging into the application. This completes the login process, indicating a successful conversion.

The reason for classifying this session as a conversion is that all initiated tasks were completed by the user (login process). The user navigated to the login page and provided their username and password, which resulted in a successful login. The minor delays or repeated clicks on the input fields do not indicate abandonment of the process but rather show that the user was actively engaged and focused on completing the task.
