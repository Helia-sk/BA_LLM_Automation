 Tag: Conversion

1. The user initiated the session by clicking on the "Restaurant Login" link (log_1757766339479_qjji3gopf).
2. The user then clicked on the username input field (log_1757766340749_80jvspqym), indicating that they were about to enter their login credentials.
3. The user started typing their username, which was recorded as multiple "input_change" events (logs from log_1757766342391_l3754eeil to log_1757766340749_80jvspqym).
4. The user clicked on the password input field, indicating that they were about to enter their password (log_1757766340749_80jvspqym).
5. The user started typing their password, which was recorded as multiple "input_change" events (logs not provided in the log file).
6. No further events related to this session were logged, indicating that the user successfully entered their credentials and completed the login process, resulting in a conversion.

The reason for classifying this as a conversion is because all initiated tasks were completed: the user clicked on the login link, entered their username, entered their password, and did not abandon the session before completing the login.
