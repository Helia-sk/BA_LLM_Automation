 Tag: Drop-Off

1. The user visits the login page (/customer/login) and clicks on a button labeled "Sign In". However, no subsequent log shows that the user has provided a username or password.

2. The user types "hi" in the username input field but does not complete any other tasks related to signing in, such as providing a password or clicking the submit button.

3. The user scrolls down the page and clicks on an anchor link that reads "Hungry? Order delicious food from local restaurants", suggesting that they may have left the login process without completing it.

4. After this, there is no further interaction or event related to the login process in the log file, indicating that the user did not successfully sign in (i.e., a drop-off occurred).
