 Tag: Drop-Off

1. The user navigated to the customer login page (/customer/login).
2. Clicked on the "Customer Login" link, indicating an intention to start a login session.
3. Entered the username "User".
4. Clicked on the username input field to give focus to it.
5. Did not enter any password or click the login button, implying an abandonment of the login process.
6. The user did not perform any other tasks in this session, so we cannot determine if any other initiated tasks were completed or abandoned. However, since the login attempt was not successful and no further actions were taken, it is reasonable to classify this as a drop-off.
