 Tag: Drop-Off

1. The user (anonymous) initiated a session by visiting the restaurant login page ("/restaurant/login"). This is the first step in the user journey.
2. The user clicked on the restaurant login button, indicating an attempt to log in. This is the second step.
3. However, after clicking the login button, no further events related to the login process were recorded. This suggests that the user may have encountered an issue or decided not to proceed, marking this as a drop-off.
4. The user then navigated to the customer login page ("/customer/login"), which could indicate an attempt to access a different part of the application. This is the third step.
5. The user clicked on the customer login button, indicating another attempt to interact with the application. However, no further events related to this action were recorded, suggesting another drop-off.
6. The user then scrolled through the home page ("/") twice, which could indicate exploration or confusion. These scroll events do not contribute to a conversion as they do not represent completed tasks.

The lack of completion of any initiated tasks (login in this case) and the absence of further interaction that leads to a clear goal indicates a drop-off. The user seems to have encountered issues or decided not to proceed with the intended actions.
