 Tag: Drop-Off

1. The user navigated to the restaurant login page (/restaurant/login) at an unknown time.
2. The user entered the username "d" and triggered the 'input_change' event, indicating that they began the process of entering their username.
3. The user then clicked on the username input field, which could be a mistake or an intent to clear the field, triggering another 'click' event. However, no subsequent 'input_change' event followed, suggesting that the user did not continue to enter their full username.
4. The user clicked on the "Sign In" button, indicating an attempt to log in. However, since they did not complete the login process by providing a password, this step can be considered abandoned.
5. No further events were recorded, indicating that the user did not continue with any other actions after this point.

Since one of the initiated tasks (providing a password) was abandoned, the session can be classified as a drop-off. The user did not complete the login process, and thus, there was no conversion.
