2. User clicked the "Restaurant Login" button (log_1757766446309_bwg76ugj7).
3. User clicked the username input field (log_1757766447943_t2x0kg879).
4. User typed "User" in the username input field (log_1757766446309_u424vzs8o, log_1757766447943_1fgdmlork).
5. User clicked the password input field (log_1757766447943_t2x0kg879).
6. User typed "User" in the password input field (not logged, so no corresponding log entry).
7. [User did not complete any other task or action that would indicate a successful login, such as clicking the submit button.]

Reason: The user initiated the login process by clicking the "Restaurant Login" button and providing their username, but they did not complete the full login process (by entering a password and clicking the submit button), so the session was a drop-off.
