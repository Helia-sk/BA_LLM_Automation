 Tag: Drop-Off

1. The user visited the restaurant login page (log_1757765941704_pc22gqgr3) and clicked on the Restaurant Partners text (log_1757765941704_pc22gqgr3).
2. The user then clicked on the form element, indicating an intention to start a login session (log_1757765942985_rcr5wz528).
3. Next, the user clicked on the username input field (log_1757765943435_g5fsn98fa). This could be considered a drop-off as the user did not proceed to enter any username or password and clicked away from the form.
4. The user then clicked on another element outside of the form, which indicates abandoning the login attempt (log_1757765943435_g5fsn98fa).

The session was not a conversion as the user abandoned the login process by clicking away from the form without completing the task.
