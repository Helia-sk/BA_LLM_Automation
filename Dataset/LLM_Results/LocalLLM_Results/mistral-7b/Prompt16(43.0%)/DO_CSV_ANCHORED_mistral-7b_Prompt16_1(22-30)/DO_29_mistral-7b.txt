 Tag: Drop-Off

1. The user first navigated to the restaurant's dashboard page (/restaurant/dashboard) from the homepage, which is an initiated task.
2. The user then clicked on the "Orders" link located on the dashboard page, indicating another initiated task.
3. Next, the user clicked on the "Menu" link on the newly opened dashboard for the Orders section, indicating yet another initiated task.
4. After clicking on the "Menu" link, the user engaged in several more interactions such as clicking on various menu items and making selections, but eventually left the page without completing any transaction or placing an order, which indicates that these tasks were abandoned.
5. The user did not return to complete any other initiated tasks, so the session was ultimately considered a drop-off because at least one of the initiated tasks was abandoned.

The reason for this classification is that the user engaged in multiple tasks related to navigating through the site and interacting with the menu but did not place an order or complete any transaction, which suggests they left the site without completing their intended goal.
