 Tag: Drop-Off

1. The user navigated to the restaurant dashboard page (/restaurant/dashboard) and clicked the "Accept" button, which indicates the start of a session.
2. The user then navigated from the restaurant dashboard to the menu page (/restaurant/dashboard/menu) by clicking on the "Menu" link.
3. The user interacted with various UI elements on the menu page, such as buttons and input fields related to adding an item. However, there is no evidence in the log file that the user successfully completed the task of adding an item (e.g., by clicking the "Add Item" button).
4. The user left the menu page without completing any other tasks, suggesting that they abandoned the process of adding an item and possibly navigating away from the website altogether.

The session was not a conversion since the initiated task (adding an item) was not completed. Instead, it appears to be a drop-off due to the user leaving the site without finishing the intended action.
