 Tag: Drop-Off

1. The user navigates to the restaurant login page (log_1757766696074_be8hnvuy0) and clicks on the "Restaurant Partners" text, indicating they have arrived at the login form.
2. The user initiates the task of filling out their username by clicking on the username input field (log_1757766696771_sqtgfw42y).
3. The user enters their username "User1" into the username input field (log_1757766698607_qhkwylapo and log_1757766696074_be8hnvuy0).
4. The user initiates the task of entering their password by clicking on the password input field (log_1757766696771_sqtgfw42y), but no further interaction with the password input field is recorded, indicating that the user abandoned the login process without entering a password.
5. No subsequent interactions are recorded after the user abandons the login process, so it can be assumed that the session ended without the user completing their task of logging in to the restaurant platform.

Reason: The session ended without the user completing the task of logging in to the restaurant platform (i.e., one initiated task was abandoned), so the session is classified as a drop-off.
