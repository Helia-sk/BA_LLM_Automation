 Tag: Drop-Off

1. The user navigated to the homepage of the website ("/") - log_1757765182697.
2. The user clicked on the title "Lieferspatz" - log_1757765176256.
3. The user clicked on the link for customer login in the header of the website ("/customer/login") - log_1757765175427 and log_1757765175789.
4. The user scrolled down the page, indicating they might have intended to fill out the login form or continue exploring the site - log_1757765182697. However, there is no subsequent log entry that shows the user completing any task related to filling out the login form or any other action on the website that would indicate a successful completion of a task, such as making a purchase or submitting a form.

Since the initiated task (login) was abandoned without completion, it indicates a drop-off in this session. The reason for this classification is that all initiated tasks were not completed.
