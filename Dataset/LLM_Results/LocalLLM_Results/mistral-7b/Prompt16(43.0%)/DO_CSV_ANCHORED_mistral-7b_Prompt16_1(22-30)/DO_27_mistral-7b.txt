 Tag: Drop-Off

1. The user navigated to the Restaurant Partners page (log_1757767454950_28ik0wqbl).
2. The user clicked on the link to register or log in (log_1757767454950_gilvwi26s).
3. The user clicked on the "Register your restaurant" button (not explicitly logged, but can be inferred as this is the only link that leads to registration) and then filled in their username (log_1757767455743_ui8r9dcbv, log_1757767454950_28ik0wqbl).
4. The user clicked on the username field to focus on it (log_1757767457681_ui8r9dcbv) but did not complete the registration process, indicating that the session was abandoned.

The reason for this classification as a drop-off is that the user initiated multiple tasks related to registering their restaurant (clicking on the link, clicking on the "Register your restaurant" button, and filling in their username), but they did not fully complete any of these tasks, which indicates that the session was abandoned.
