 Tag: Drop-Off

1. [Step 1] The user initiated the session by navigating to the "/customer/login" page (log_1757763455454_paomh4a3f).
2. [Step 2] The user clicked on the "Customer Login" link, indicating an attempt to start the login process (log_1757763455454_paomh4a3f).
3. [Step 3] After clicking the "Customer Login" link, the user interacted with the username input field by clicking it (log_1757763456645_wa8r0ksdg).
4. [Step 4] The user entered a username value of "User1" into the username input field (log_1757763459498_qayv4y9xn, log_1757763459999_rcj9lzlxg).
5. [Step 5] The user interacted with the password input field by clicking it (log_1757763456645_wa8r0ksdg), but no further interaction or submission of a password was recorded, indicating that the login process was not completed.

The session is considered a drop-off because although the user initiated the login process, they did not complete it by submitting their password. The lack of a password entry indicates that the user abandoned the login process before completing it, which is a drop-off event in this context.
