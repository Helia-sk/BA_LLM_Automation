 Tag: Drop-Off

1. The user navigated to the login page (/restaurant/login) by clicking on the "Restaurant Partners" link.
2. The user entered their username ("User1") and clicked on the username input field, indicating an attempt to enter a password. However, there is no record of a password being entered or submitted, which suggests that the user may have abandoned the login process at this point.
3. The user clicked on the username input field again, suggesting another possible attempt to enter a password, but there is no further interaction recorded in the log file.

The reason for classifying this as a drop-off is that the user initiated a task (logging in) but did not complete it by submitting the required credentials, which implies that the user may have left the page without logging in.
