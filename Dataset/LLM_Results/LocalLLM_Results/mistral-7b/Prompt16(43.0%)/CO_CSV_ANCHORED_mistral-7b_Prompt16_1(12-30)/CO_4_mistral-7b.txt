 Tag: Drop-Off

1. The user navigated to the restaurant login page (log_1757772897799_nqzze9f9t).
2. The user clicked on the "Restaurant Login" button (log_1757772897799_oyux16s7v), indicating an attempt to start a new session.
3. The user then clicked on the username input field (log_1757772900702_fnh4c2rlu), suggesting an intent to enter their login credentials. However, this is where the sequence ends. No further interaction related to entering a password or submitting the form was recorded.
4. The user clicked on the "Already have an account? Sign in" link (log_1757772899548_77h99t01p), indicating that they might want to register instead, but no further action related to registration was recorded after this click event.
5. No subsequent events related to form submission or any other action that could be considered a conversion were logged in the provided log file.

Reason: The user initiated two tasks (login and potentially registration), but did not complete either, hence it is classified as a drop-off.
