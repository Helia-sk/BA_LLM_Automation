 Tag: Drop-Off

1. The user initiated a click on the "Hungry? Order delicious food from local restaurants" link (log_1758983199627). This indicates that the user may have been enticed by the offer but did not continue further to engage in the intended action (ordering food or logging into their account for that purpose).

2. The user then navigated to the login page (/customer/login) (log_1758983199627).

3. The user clicked on the login form (log_1758983199627_hngsyu5zy). This suggests that the user intended to log in but did not provide any credentials, implying an abandonment of the login process.

4. After this, we can see a series of interactions with the username and password fields (logs from 2025-09-27T14:26:40.277Z to 2025-09-27T14:26:42.043Z). However, these interactions do not correspond to successful login attempts since we don't see any subsequent logs indicating a successful login or completion of the intended action (ordering food).

5. The user then clicked on the username field and provided the input "User1" (log_1758983200277) and subsequently clicked on the password field (log_1758983200633), but we do not have any subsequent logs indicating a successful login or any further interaction beyond these actions.

As a result, the user journey did not lead to the completion of any intended tasks, suggesting that this session was a drop-off. The user may have been deterred by various factors such as lack of motivation, technical difficulties, or poor user experience.
