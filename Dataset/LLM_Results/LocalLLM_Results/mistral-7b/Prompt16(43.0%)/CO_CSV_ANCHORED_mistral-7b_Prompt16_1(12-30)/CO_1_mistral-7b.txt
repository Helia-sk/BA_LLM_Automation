 Tag: Drop-Off

1. The user initiated the session by clicking on the "Customer Login" link (log_1757772472157_hcra1onsw).
2. The user then clicked on the username input field (log_1757772473391_2bzxxm2il) and entered "User1" as the username (log_1757772475335_o1b6b8hlb, log_1757772472157_i2mznptqp).
3. The user clicked on the password input field (log_1757772473391_o1b6b8hlb), but no password was entered, which indicates that the user did not complete the login process and abandoned the session.

Reason: Drop-Off because even though the user initiated the login process by clicking on the "Customer Login" link, they did not complete the login process by entering a valid password. The user abandoned the session after entering their username.
