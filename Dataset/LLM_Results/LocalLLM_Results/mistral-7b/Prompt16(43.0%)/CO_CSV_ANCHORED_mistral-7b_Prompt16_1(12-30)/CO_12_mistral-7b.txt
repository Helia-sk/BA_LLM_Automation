==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off

1. The user (anonymous) clicked on the "Menu" link to navigate to the menu page (log_1757835612743_miziub7ti).
2. On the menu page, the user initiated the task of adding an item by clicking the "Add Item" button (log_1757835648113_q9q7i6th6).
3. However, after clicking the "Add Item" button, no subsequent logs show that the user completed the steps to actually add an item, such as filling out a form or confirming the action. Instead, the user clicked on various input fields (log_1757835661503_up65plizp, log_1757835661503_up65plizp, etc.) but did not complete them, indicating that they abandoned the task of adding an item.
4. The user then interacted with more input fields on the menu page (log_1757835661503_up65plizp, log_1757835666263_rbuw5rasj, etc.) but did not complete them, suggesting that they abandoned these tasks as well.
5. The session ended without any indication that the user completed their intended actions or navigated away from the menu page.

Reason: The user initiated tasks (adding an item to the menu) but abandoned those tasks before completing them, indicating a drop-off in this session.
