 Tag: Drop-Off

The session was initiated by a frontend click event on the /restaurant/dashboard page at two different times (log_1758985707836_pm260wx8m and log_1758985714781_tw6p4axzk). However, there are no subsequent events in the log file that indicate a completion of any tasks. The specific HTTP requests and responses between the backend and frontend show an attempt to accept an order (/api/orders/26/accept), but these attempts do not lead to a completed task or any further interaction that would confirm a successful order acceptance. This suggests that the user may have abandoned the process before completing it, thus classifying this session as a drop-off.

1. [Step 1] The user navigated to the /restaurant/dashboard page on their browser.
2. [Step 2] The user clicked the "Accept" button (log_1758985707836_pm260wx8m) on the dashboard, which initiated an attempt to accept an order.
3. [Step 3] The frontend sent a click event for the "Accept" button (log_1758985714781_tw6p4axzk). However, no subsequent events or responses indicate that the order was successfully accepted, suggesting that the user may have abandoned the process.
