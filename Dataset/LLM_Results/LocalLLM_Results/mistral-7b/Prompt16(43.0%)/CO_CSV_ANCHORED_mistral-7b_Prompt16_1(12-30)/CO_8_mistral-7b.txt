 Tag: Drop-Off

1. User navigates to the customer login page (log_1757773780414_4g211r8g2). This can be considered as a start of the session.
2. User clicks on the "Username" field (log_1757773797385_uwv7j47ib) indicating that they are preparing to enter their username.
3. User clicks on the "Username" field again (log_1757773797833_std7mojhy), which could indicate a mistake or hesitation in entering the username.
4. User clicks outside of the "Username" field, indicating that they have moved their focus away from it (implied in log_1757773797385_uwv7j47ib and log_1757773797833_std7mojhy but not explicitly stated). This is a clear indication that the user has abandoned the username input field.
5. User clicks on the "Username" field again (log_1757773797385_uwv7j47ib), which suggests they are still trying to interact with it, but without entering any data. This is another sign of abandonment.
6. User clicks on the password input field (implied in log_1757773798425_q4q27vmpw and log_1757773798433_yq0xzjp6t but not explicitly stated). This could be a sign that they are preparing to enter their password, but without any data entered, it's unclear if this is part of a login attempt.
7. User clicks on the username input field again (log_1757773798425_q4q27vmpw), which suggests they are still trying to interact with it, but without entering any data. This is another sign of abandonment.
8. User clicks away from the password input field (implied in log_1757773798433_yq0xzjp6t and log_1757773798425_q4q27vmpw but not explicitly stated), indicating that they have moved their focus away from it. This is a clear indication that the user has abandoned the password input field.

As all initiated tasks (username and password input) were abandoned, this session can be classified as a drop-off. The user did not complete the login process.
