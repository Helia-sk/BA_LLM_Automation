 Tag: Conversion

The session was a conversion because all the initiated tasks were completed. The user followed these steps to complete the task:

1. Clicked on the "Restaurant Partners" link (logged in to the landing page).
2. Clicked on the "Register your restaurant or log in to manage orders" link (navigated to the login/registration page).
3. Entered a username ("User1") and clicked away from the username input field (completed the username field task).
4. Clicked on the username input field again (indicating an error, possibly due to an incorrect username) and corrected it by entering "User1" again.
5. Clicked away from the username input field again (completed the username field task for a second time).
6. Entered a password in the password input field (completed the password field task).
7. Clicked on the submit button of the login form, indicating a successful login attempt.
8. Clicked on the link within the welcome message after a successful login, indicating that the user continued to navigate within the application.

The reason for classifying this session as a conversion is that the user initiated and completed all tasks related to logging in to the application. The correction of the username indicates an attempt to resolve an error in the first submission but was not required since the subsequent successful login attempt indicates that the initial entry was valid after correction.
