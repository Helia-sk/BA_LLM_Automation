 Tag: Conversion

1. The user first lands on the main dashboard (log_1757773977591_3etisigwv).
2. They click on the "Restaurants" link, indicating an interest in navigating to the restaurants section (log_1757773978615_bwt5ki2v4).
3. The user then visits a specific restaurant page (log_1757773978718_dw1dc2kpq) and clicks on the image area, but there seems to be no further actions related to that restaurant.
4. The user continues scrolling down the restaurant page, indicating they are still engaged with the content (log_1757773978615_bwt5ki2v4).
5. The user clicks on another restaurant link from the main dashboard (log_1757773981159_b1lbxr8pf), implying they are still interested in exploring more restaurants.
6. They then visit a new restaurant page and scroll through its content, showing continued engagement (log_1757773987120_1qj4k4i1y).
7. The user finally clicks on another "Restaurants" link from the main dashboard (log_1757773990615_bxm2gw0zr), which is different from their previous interactions, suggesting they are still exploring different options.
8. They visit yet another restaurant page and again scroll through its content (log_1757773994144_2fkjq68jv).
9. The user's last action is clicking on a restaurant image area, but there are no subsequent actions related to that restaurant, indicating they might have left the page or moved to another part of the site (log_1757773994144_2fkjq68jv).
10. The session ends without any further interactions (log_1757773995681_w7xg4zr6s).

Since all initiated tasks were completed, this session can be considered a conversion. The user started by exploring the restaurant section and continued to visit multiple restaurant pages, indicating they were engaged in finding restaurants of interest. The lack of subsequent actions on the last visited page suggests they may have left that particular page but not necessarily the entire site.
