1. The user (anonymous) initiated a session by navigating to the restaurant's dashboard menu page at `http://localhost:5173/restaurant/dashboard/menu`.
2. The user scrolled through the list of menu items, indicating an interest in browsing available options.
3. The user clicked on the "Add Item" button, which suggests that they intended to add a new item to the menu.
4. After clicking "Add Item", the user navigated back to the list of menu items, suggesting that they were looking for the specific item they wanted to add.
5. The user selected an item (saladmixvery healthy) and clicked on it, indicating their intention to edit its details or price.
6. Finally, the user clicked on another item (best dessert ever), which is a clear indication that they are adding multiple items to the menu, not just one.
7. The user then clicked on the "Upload Image" button, suggesting that they were going to upload images for the added items.

Since all initiated tasks (browsing menu, adding item, selecting specific item, and uploading image) were completed by the user, this session can be classified as a conversion. The user successfully added two new menu items to the restaurant's dashboard.
