1. The user initiated a session by visiting the dashboard (log_1757774548389_y8ni9pig8).
2. The user navigated to the Orders section from the dashboard (log_1757774552191_pe3hhyxl6).
3. The user clicked on an order to view its details (log_1757774553728_fcdp6kaj7).
4. The user clicked on the "View Details" button for the selected order (log_1757774553728_pl5gfcq86).
5. The user viewed the details of the order, including its status, total amount, notes, customer details, and order items (log_1757774552191_pe3hhyxl6).
6. The user returned to the Orders section by clicking on the "Orders" link again (log_1757774553728_pl5gfcq86, log_1757774552191_3t98ln93j).
7. The user clicked on another order in the Orders section to view its details (log_1757774548389_g9ejp5srb).
8. The user viewed the details of the second order, including its status, total amount, notes, customer details, and order items (not explicitly logged but inferred from the log entry).
9. The user clicked on the "View Details" button for the second order (log_1757774548389_g9ejp5srb).
10. The user viewed the details of the second order again, showing that they had interacted with both orders' details pages and completed their intended action within the session.

Reason: All initiated tasks were completed, so the session was a conversion. The user not only navigated to the Orders section but also viewed the details for two different orders in the Orders section, indicating an intent to review or manage their orders.
