Here is the user journey step-by-step:

1. The user initiated a click on the "Customer Login" link (log_1758982001023_zzkgn108u).
2. The user entered a username ("User1") and clicked on the username input field (log_1758982003418_3owdv9ltz, log_1758982003409_dg6kj8l0p).
3. The user interacted with the username input field again, indicating that they are typing their password (log_1758982003418_miqid4ba6, log_1758982003411_vhj4gkzlf).
4. The user clicked on the username input field again, implying that they have finished entering their password and are ready to submit (log_1758982001809_u5d0yu5q9).
5. The user finally clicked on the "Login" button, which signifies a successful login attempt (log_1758982001023_gz1q16dwh).

The reason for classifying this session as a conversion is that all initiated tasks were completed by the user. They clicked on the "Customer Login" link, entered their username and password, and successfully logged in, indicating a successful completion of the intended task.
