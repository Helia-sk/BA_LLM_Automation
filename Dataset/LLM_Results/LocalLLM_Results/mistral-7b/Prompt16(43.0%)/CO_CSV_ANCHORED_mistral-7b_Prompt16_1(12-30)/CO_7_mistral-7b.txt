Prompt: Analyze the following log file. Determine if the session was a drop-off or a conversion.Consider every initiated task, A task counts as a conversion only if it is fully completed. If all initiated tasks are completed → Tag: Conversion. If even one fo the  initiated tasks are abandoned → Tag: Drop-Off. Provide a reason for your classification. Then, outline the user journey step-by-step.Format your response as follows:
Tag: Conversion || Drop-Off ||  [Reason].
1. [Step 1]
2. [Step 2]
3. [Step 3] …
==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off

1. The user initiated the session by navigating to the customer login page (log_1757773371689_3ak46jhcx).
2. The user clicked on the "Customer Login" button, indicating an intention to log in (log_1757773371689_3ak46jhcx).
3. Upon reaching the login form, the user clicked on the username input field (log_1757773372596_2oj0c59xu). This step could be considered as an initial attempt to enter the username.
4. The user then clicked on the password input field (not shown in the log, but can be assumed based on typical login behavior).
5. However, there is no further interaction with the password field or the "Login" button, which suggests that the user may have abandoned the process without submitting their credentials (no corresponding logs for click events on password input or the "Login" button are present).
6. The user clicked away from the login form and navigated back to the homepage (not shown in the log, but this can be inferred as the user did not complete the login process).

The reason for classifying the session as a drop-off is that the user initiated the login process but failed to complete it by submitting their credentials. The lack of further interaction with the password input field or the "Login" button indicates an abandonment of the task, and the navigation away from the login form supports this interpretation.
