 Tag: Drop-Off

1. The user visited the customer login page ("/customer/login") (log_1757772635942_8b03evpom).
2. The user clicked on the "Customer Login" button (log_1757772635942_8b03evpom), initiating the login process.
3. The user entered their username ("user") and clicked on the username input field (log_1757772641131_txuz0gaml, log_1757772640076_ko6uzo7bv). However, it appears that the user did not proceed to enter their password or click the submit button, indicating an abandoned login attempt.
4. The user clicked on the "Already have an account? Sign in" link (log_1757772640076_ko6uzo7bv), which suggests that they might have intended to create a new account or recover a lost one, but no further actions were taken after this.

As the user initiated the login process but did not complete it (by entering their password and clicking the submit button), this session can be classified as a drop-off. The user's journey was interrupted, and they didn't achieve their intended goal of logging in or creating/recovering an account.
