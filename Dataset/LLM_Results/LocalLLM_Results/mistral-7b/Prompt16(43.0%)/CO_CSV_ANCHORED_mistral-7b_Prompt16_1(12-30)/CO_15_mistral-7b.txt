 Tag: Drop-Off

1. The user initiated a navigation to the "/customer/login" page (log_1758982282530_ew7a529gr) indicating they want to start a session.
2. The user clicked on the "Customer Login" button (log_1758982299417_vimywuxpt), which is the first step towards logging in.
3. The user then clicked on the username input field (log_1758982300242_lmwx4qaau) to start typing their username.
4. However, the log shows that the user did not complete any further actions related to entering their username or password, indicating that they abandoned the login process. The last action in the log file is a click on the username input field (log_1758982302837_uugm0ut74), which shows that the user did not fully complete the login task.

Reason: The session was dropped off because the user initiated the login process but did not complete it, abandoning the action. This is evident from the last interaction being a click on the username input field without any subsequent actions related to entering their username or password.
