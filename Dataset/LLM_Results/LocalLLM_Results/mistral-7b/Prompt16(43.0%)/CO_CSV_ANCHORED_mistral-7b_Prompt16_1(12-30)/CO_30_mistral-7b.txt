 Tag: Drop-Off

1. The user (session_1758986435792) navigated to the restaurant dashboard page (/restaurant/dashboard) at 2025-09-27T15:20:35.792Z, which indicates the start of their session. This is a typical first step for a user visiting a website.

2. The user clicked on the "History" link (log_1758986443885_f6704o3gl) at 2025-09-27T15:20:43.885Z, indicating they wanted to view the history of their orders or past interactions with the restaurant.

3. The user clicked on a button labeled "View Details" (log_1758986445667_dz4phj6uu) at 2025-09-27T15:20:45.667Z, suggesting they intended to view more details about a specific order or interaction. However, this is the last action recorded for this session, and there are no subsequent actions that indicate the user completed any task related to viewing their history or placing an order.

The reason for classifying this session as a drop-off is because while the user initiated two tasks (navigating to the dashboard and attempting to view details), they did not complete either of these tasks, implying they abandoned their interaction with the website before completing their intended goal. This could be due to various reasons such as finding the information they needed quickly or encountering issues during their visit.

The user journey for this session can be summarized as follows:
1. Navigated to the restaurant dashboard page (/restaurant/dashboard) at 2025-09-27T15:20:35.792Z
2. Clicked on the "History" link to view their order history or past interactions at 2025-09-27T15:20:43.885Z
3. Attempted to view details about a specific order or interaction by clicking on the "View Details" button at 2025-09-27T15:20:45.667Z
[The session was abandoned without completing any task]
