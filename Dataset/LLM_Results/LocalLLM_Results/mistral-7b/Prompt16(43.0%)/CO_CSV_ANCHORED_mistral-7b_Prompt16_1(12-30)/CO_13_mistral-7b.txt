1. A user (with an anonymous ID) initiated a session by visiting the restaurant's dashboard history page at `/restaurant/dashboard/history` on frontend (log_1757835951066_9edj3bwaz).
2. The user clicked on the "History" link, which was a navigation action to display the list of orders in the dashboard history (log_1757835961979_hw4mtgead).
3. The user then clicked on an order item (order 21) to view its details (log_1757835963781_2e9f53t2n and log_1757835964770_mkg4r77nu).
4. The user clicked the "View Details" button, which was a navigation action to access the details of order 21 (log_1757835964770_bxxdd7utl and log_1757835963781_bsko3h99x).
5. The user clicked on the "Done" button, which was a confirmation action to close the order details modal (log_1757835964770_mkg4r77nu).

Since all initiated tasks in this session were completed, it is considered a conversion as the user successfully viewed and confirmed the details of an order item.
