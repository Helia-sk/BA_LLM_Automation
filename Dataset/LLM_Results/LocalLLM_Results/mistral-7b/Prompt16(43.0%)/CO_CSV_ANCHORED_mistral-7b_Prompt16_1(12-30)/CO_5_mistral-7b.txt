 Tag: Drop-Off

1. The user initiated a scroll event, indicating they navigated to the homepage of the website (log_1757773013317_qjhw9th5q).
2. The user clicked on the "Customer Login" link (log_1757773015075_4wi4zz4v7), indicating they intended to log in.
3. The user scrolled down the customer login page, but did not provide any information in the username field (no corresponding log entry found). This suggests that they may have abandoned the form without completing it.
4. The user scrolled up the page (log_1757773012670_mp8atqp66), which could indicate they were trying to correct an error or reconsider their action, but no further interaction was recorded in the log file.

Reason: The session was a drop-off because the user initiated the login process but did not complete it by providing any information in the username field. They may have encountered an issue or decided against logging in for some other reason.
