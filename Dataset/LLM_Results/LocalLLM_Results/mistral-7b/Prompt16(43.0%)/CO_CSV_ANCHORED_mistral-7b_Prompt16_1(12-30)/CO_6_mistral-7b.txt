 Tag: Drop-Off

1. The user initiated a click on the "Customer Login" link (log_1757773371689_3ak46jhcx), indicating they started the process of logging in as a customer.
2. The user then clicked on the username input field (log_1757773373072_scoku9tbi) to start typing their username, but did not complete any further actions related to entering a username or password.
3. The user clicked on the username input field again (log_1757773372596_2oj0c59xu), suggesting they might have been trying to correct something, but no further actions related to the login process were recorded after this.
4. The user clicked on the username input field yet again (log_1757773373072_l45tbs735), indicating a possible attempt to start the login process once more, but no further actions related to the login process were recorded after this.

The session was dropped off because the user initiated the login process, but did not complete it by entering their username or password. The lack of any subsequent actions related to the login process suggests that the user may have abandoned the task.
