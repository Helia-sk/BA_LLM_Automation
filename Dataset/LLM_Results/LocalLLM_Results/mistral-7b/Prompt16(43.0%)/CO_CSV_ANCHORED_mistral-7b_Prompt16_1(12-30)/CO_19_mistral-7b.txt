==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off

1. The user initiated a navigation to the homepage from the restaurant dashboard settings (log_1758982735683_nn4i1w1qb). This counts as an action, but not necessarily a conversion since it's just a page view.

2. The user clicked on the "Customer Login" button (log_1758982745841_zt9tbfo0t), which is considered as another action and might suggest that the user intended to log in. However, this alone does not constitute a conversion.

3. The user clicked on the username input field (log_1758982746939_7qttgtuwg) but did not perform any other action related to filling out the form or submitting it, indicating that the login process was not completed. This is a drop-off since an initiated task (logging in) was abandoned without being fully completed.

The user journey can be summarized as follows:
1. The user navigated to the homepage from the restaurant dashboard settings.
2. The user clicked on the "Customer Login" button, which might suggest that they intended to log in.
3. The user clicked on the username input field but did not proceed with filling out the form or submitting it, indicating a drop-off in the login process.
