 Tag: Drop-Off

The session was a drop-off because the user initiated several tasks but did not complete all of them before leaving the website. Specifically, the user clicked on the "Restaurant Login" link (step 1), filled out the login form by clicking on the username input field and typing something in it (step 2), then clicked away from the input field, which could be interpreted as an intent to continue filling out the form but was not followed up with any further action (step 3). However, the user did not submit the form or click on any other links indicating that they intended to complete the login process. Instead, they clicked on a different link (the "Already have an account? Sign in" button), which could suggest that they were considering signing up instead, but again, they did not follow through with this task either. Therefore, since the user did not complete any of the tasks they initiated, the session was a drop-off.

User Journey:
1. Clicked on the "Restaurant Login" link (indicating an intent to login).
2. Clicked on the username input field and provided some input (potentially starting the login process).
3. Clicked away from the username input field without completing the form or taking any further action (abandoning the login task).
4. Clicked on the "Already have an account? Sign in" button, potentially considering signing up instead (but did not complete this task either).
