 Tag: Drop-Off

The session was a drop-off because the user initiated the task (clicking on "Customer Login") but did not complete it by entering any username or password and submitting the form. The user navigated away from the form after clicking on it, which suggests that they may have abandoned the login process.

Here's the step-by-step user journey:
1. [Step 1] The user navigated to the "Customer Login" page (indicated by clicking on the link with text "Customer Login").
2. [Step 2] The user clicked on the "Username" input field (indicating that they were likely preparing to enter their username).
3. [Step 3] The user clicked outside of the "Username" input field, suggesting that they might have decided not to enter a username (this is an incomplete action, as a username is required to proceed with the login process).
4. [Step 4] The user clicked on the "Password" input field (indicating that they were likely preparing to enter their password).
5. [Step 5] The user did not enter any password and did not attempt to submit the form (this is an incomplete action, as a password and form submission are required to complete the login process).
6. [Step 6] The user clicked away from the form, suggesting that they might have abandoned the login process.
