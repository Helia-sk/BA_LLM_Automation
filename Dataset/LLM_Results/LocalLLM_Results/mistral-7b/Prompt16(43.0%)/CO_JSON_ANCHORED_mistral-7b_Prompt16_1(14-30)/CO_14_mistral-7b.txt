The session was a conversion because all the initiated tasks were completed in this case.

After that, they clicked again on the same username input field, indicating that they may have accidentally clicked it but eventually typed something into it. Then, they moved to the password input field and entered their password. Finally, they clicked the submit button, which is considered a conversion since the form was submitted successfully.
