 Tag: Drop-Off

1. The user initiated a click on the "Restaurant Partners" link, which suggests they were interested in registering their restaurant or logging in to manage orders.
2. The user then clicked on the "UsernamePasswordSign In" button, indicating an intent to log in or create an account.
3. The user proceeded to click on both the username and password input fields, suggesting they were entering their credentials. However, the log does not show any further interaction with the form, such as a click on the submit button. This indicates that the user did not complete the login process, which is an initiated but abandoned task.
4. The user clicked on the username and password input fields again, possibly attempting to correct their inputs, but there is no subsequent action indicating a successful login or further interaction with the site.
5. The user left the page by clicking elsewhere on the page (not shown in the log), indicating they did not complete any other tasks during this session.

The user's actions do not constitute a conversion as they initiated but did not fully complete any task. They dropped off during the login process.
