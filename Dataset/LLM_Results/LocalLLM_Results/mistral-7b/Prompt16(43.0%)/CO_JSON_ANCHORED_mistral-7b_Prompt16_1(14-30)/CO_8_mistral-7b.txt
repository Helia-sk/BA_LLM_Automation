 Tag: Drop-Off

1. The user first clicked on the "Customer Login" link (Log ID: log_1757773780414_vgl8l6n2s), which indicates the initiation of a login attempt.
2. Next, the user clicked on the "Username" field (Log ID: log_1757773797385_uwv7j47ib), suggesting that they were about to enter their username. However, no further interaction with the username field was recorded.
3. The user then clicked on the password field (Log ID: log_1757773797833_std7mojhy), implying an attempt to input their password but no subsequent actions were logged.
4. The user interacted with the username field again by clicking it (Log ID: log_1757773797385_fuwosxi9g) and then clicked on the password field (Log ID: log_1757773797833_std7mojhy) once more. This suggests that they may have been trying to correct an error but no further interactions were recorded after this point, indicating that the login attempt was abandoned.
5. No interaction with the "Submit" button or any other element that would indicate a successful login was found in the log file.

Reason: The user initiated a login attempt but did not complete it, implying an abandoned session (Drop-Off). The lack of subsequent interactions after repeated attempts to enter username and password suggests that the user may have encountered difficulties during the login process or decided to stop trying.
