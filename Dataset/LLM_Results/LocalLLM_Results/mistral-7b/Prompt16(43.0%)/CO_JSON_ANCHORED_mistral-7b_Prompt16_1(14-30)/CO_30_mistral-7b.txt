 Tag: Drop-Off

The session was a drop-off because the user initiated multiple tasks (clicking on "History", then "View Details", but eventually closed the page without completing the intended task).

Here is the user journey step-by-step:

1. [Step 1] The user navigated to the dashboard page of the restaurant application.
2. [Step 2] The user clicked on the "History" link in the dashboard, indicating that they wanted to view the order history.
3. [Step 3] The user then clicked on a specific entry to view its details. However, instead of completing the intended action (viewing the details), they closed the page, implying that they did not find what they were looking for or had an unexpected experience that caused them to abandon the task.
4. [Step 4] The user left the application without performing any other actions.
