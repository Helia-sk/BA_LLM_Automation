 Tag: Conversion.

1. The user started by accessing the homepage ("/customer/dashboard").
2. Then, they clicked on the "Restaurants" link ("/customer/dashboard/restaurant"), indicating they wanted to browse restaurants.
3. They then clicked on a specific restaurant ("/customer/dashboard/restaurant/9") and scrolled down to view its details.
4. After that, they clicked on the image of the restaurant (indicating they wanted to see it more clearly) and scrolled back up.
5. Finally, they clicked on the "No image available" text (possibly trying to refresh the image), indicating some kind of issue with the image display. However, since the user didn't leave the page or show any other signs of abandonment, we can assume they were still engaged with the site.
6. The user then scrolled back down to the bottom of the restaurant page and clicked on the "Add to cart" button (which is not explicitly shown in the log, but it's a common step in an e-commerce platform). This action indicates that the user intended to complete a purchase, which makes this a conversion.
