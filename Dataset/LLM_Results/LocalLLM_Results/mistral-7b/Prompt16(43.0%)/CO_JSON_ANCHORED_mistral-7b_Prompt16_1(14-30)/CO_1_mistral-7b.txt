 Tag: Conversion

The session was a conversion because all the initiated tasks were completed. Here is the user journey step-by-step:

1. The user navigated to the homepage (as indicated by the "click" event on the link with text "Customer Login").
2. Upon clicking the "Customer Login" link, the user was taken to the login page, where they clicked and interacted with the username input field (indicated by two "input_change" events).
3. After entering their username, the user also interacted with the password input field (indicated by two more "input_change" events).
4. The user then clicked on the login button, which is not explicitly logged in this file, but we can infer that since no subsequent actions related to a login were recorded, the user must have successfully logged in.
5. After logging in, the user did not perform any further actions (as indicated by the lack of any subsequent events), suggesting they may have navigated elsewhere or closed the browser window, indicating a successful login and completion of the session.
