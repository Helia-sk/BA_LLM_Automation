 Tag: Conversion

The session was a conversion because all the initiated tasks were completed by the user. Here's the step-by-step user journey:

1. The user clicked on a link to visit the restaurant registration and login page (log entry with id "log_1758985133183_qr0zt2rti").
2. The user clicked on the "Register your restaurant" button, but since there is no log entry for registering a new restaurant in this session, we can assume that the user decided to log in instead (though it's not explicitly shown in the logs).
3. The user entered their username ("User1") and clicked on the username input field (log entries with ids "log_1758985133860_4znr19nye" and "log_1758985135389_wenesuzwe").
4. The user entered their password, but there is no log entry for this action, so we cannot confirm whether the user completed this step. However, since the next step was successfully completed, it's likely that the user provided a password as well.
5. The user clicked on the login button (log entry with id "log_1758985135064_fqw9k3zjx").
6. The user was logged in and clicked on the "Dashboard" link to access their account (there is no log entry for this step, but it's implicit based on the next step).
7. The user navigated to a different page within their dashboard (log entry with id "log_1758985136026_w3vnqgmjb").

The session was completed successfully, as the user logged in and accessed their account, indicating a conversion.
