==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off

1. The user initiated the session by navigating to the home page (`/`) from a previous location (`referrer` field). This is Step 1.
2. The user clicked on the "Customer Login" button, which took them to the customer login page (`/customer/login`), which was Step 2.
3. The user then interacted with the username input field by clicking it (Step 3), but did not provide any input or complete the login process. This indicates that the user abandoned the login process, suggesting a drop-off.
4. The user also clicked on the username input field again later in the session, which suggests they may have intended to attempt the login process again, but no further actions were recorded indicating completion of the task (Step 3.1).
5. No other interactions or tasks were initiated during this session, indicating that the user did not progress beyond the login page.

Reason: The user initiated the customer login process but did not complete it, suggesting they abandoned the process. This is indicative of a drop-off.
