 Tag: Conversion

The session was a conversion because all the initiated tasks were completed. The user first navigated to the login page (form_submit event), entered their credentials (input_change events), clicked the "Sign In" button (click event), and finally submitted the form (form_submit event). There is no evidence of any task being abandoned during this session, thus classifying it as a conversion.

Here's the user journey step-by-step:

1. [Step 1] User navigated to the login page ("/restaurant/login") by clicking on the "Sign In" button from somewhere else on the website or followed a direct link.
2. [Step 2] User filled in their username and password fields and clicked the "Sign In" button again to submit the form.
3. [Step 3] The user's credentials were verified, and they were successfully logged in, allowing them to access the protected content on the website (not shown in the log file).
