1. The user first clicked on the "History" link in the dashboard (Step 1).
2. After that, they clicked on a specific transaction detail to view its details (Step 2).
3. Subsequently, the user clicked on the "X" button to close the details popup (Step 3), but this action is not considered as an abandonment because it's common behavior when users have finished reviewing the details and want to return to the main view.
4. The user then clicked on the "History" link again, this time to go back to the history page (Step 4).
5. Lastly, the user initiated a new task by clicking on the "View Details" button for another transaction in the history list (Step 5).
6. Since the user completed all the initiated tasks, namely, viewing and closing two different transaction details, this session is considered a conversion. The reason for classification as a conversion is that every initiated task was fully completed.
