1. The user (anonymous) accessed the restaurant's dashboard page (`/restaurant/dashboard`) at `2025-09-14T07:40:12.743Z`.
2. The user clicked on the "Menu" link located at x=601, y=124 on the dashboard page at `2025-09-14T07:40:12.743Z`. This navigated the user to the menu page (presumably).
3. On the menu page, the user clicked the "Add Item" button at x=1540, y=219 at `2025-09-14T07:40:48.113Z`. This action is indicative of trying to add an item to the menu.
4. The user then interacted with the input field for adding an item by clicking on it (at x=936, y=501 at `2025-09-14T07:41:01.503Z`). This indicates that the user initiated the process of adding an item to the menu.
5. The user typed in "Salad" into the input field for adding an item (at x=936, y=501) and confirmed by clicking on the same input field again at `2025-09-14T07:41:06.843Z`. This action completed the process of adding an item to the menu.
6. Finally, the user clicked on the "Add Item" button again at x=1540, y=219 at `2025-09-14T07:41:18.367Z`. This action submitted the form and added the item "Salad" to the menu.

Since all initiated tasks (visiting the dashboard page, navigating to the menu page, adding an item to the menu) were completed, this session can be classified as a conversion. The user successfully navigated through the process of adding an item to the menu.
