 Tag: Drop-Off

Reason: The user initiated the tasks for "Balance", "Orders", and "View Details" but did not complete any of them, as indicated by the subsequent clicks on the "Back" or "Close" buttons (implied by the "Orange 500" class in the log file which often represents a back or close button). This user abandoned the tasks before completion.

2. [Step 2] The user clicked on the "Balance" link to view their balance information.
3. [Step 3] The user clicked on the "Orders" link to view their order history.
4. [Step 4] The user clicked on the "View Details" button for one of the orders, indicating an intention to view more details about that specific order.
5. [Step 5] Instead of completing this task by viewing the order details, the user clicked on the back or close button (implied by the "Orange 500" class in the log file), abandoning the task and returning to the orders page.
6. [Step 6] The user clicked on the "Back" or "Close" button again (again implied by the "Orange 500" class) to navigate away from the orders page, ending the session without completing any tasks.
