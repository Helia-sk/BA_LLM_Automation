 Tag: Drop-Off

The session was a drop-off because the user initiated tasks (clicking on the "Customer Login" link) but did not complete them (entering username, password, and clicking the "Sign in" button). The user abandoned the session after clicking on the "Customer Login" link.

Here is the user journey step-by-step:
1. The user navigated to the home page of the website ("http://localhost:5173/").
2. The user clicked on the "Customer Login" link, which took them to the login page ("http://localhost:5173/customer/login").
3. The user did not enter any username or password and did not click the "Sign in" button, indicating that they abandoned the session.
