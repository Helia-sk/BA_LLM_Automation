 Tag: Drop-Off

1. The user visited the Restaurant Login page (Log ID: log_1757772852515_uvv517x14).
2. The user clicked on the "Restaurant Login" link (Log ID: log_1757772853662_q9fok5nbl). This action initiated a task, but it was not followed by any other actions related to the login process or navigation to another page.
3. The user clicked on the username input field (Log ID: log_1757772852515_uvv507x14). This could be considered as an attempt to enter a username, but no further actions related to entering a password or submitting the login form were recorded.
4. The user clicked on the password input field (Log ID: log_1757772853662_lp2vv7jeb). This could be considered as an attempt to enter a password, but no further actions related to entering a username or submitting the login form were recorded.
5. The user clicked on the password input field again (Log ID: log_1757772853662_lp2vv7jeb). This suggests that the user may have made a mistake and decided to correct it, but no further actions related to entering a username or submitting the login form were recorded.
6. The user clicked on the username input field again (Log ID: log_1757772852515_kr8f335rr). This indicates that the user may have made another mistake and decided to correct it, but no further actions related to entering a password or submitting the login form were recorded.

The session was dropped off because the initiated task of logging in was abandoned without any further action towards completion. The user did not navigate to any other page, submit the login form, or perform any action that could be considered as a conversion.
