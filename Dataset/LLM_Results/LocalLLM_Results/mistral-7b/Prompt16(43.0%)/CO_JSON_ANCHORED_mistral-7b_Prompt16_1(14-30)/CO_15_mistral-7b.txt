1. The user first visited the homepage ("/") at 2025-09-27T14:11:22.530Z, indicating an initiation of a session.
2. Next, the user navigated to the "Customer Login" page from the homepage by clicking on the corresponding link at 2025-09-27T14:11:39.417Z.
3. The user then clicked on the username input field at 2025-09-27T14:11:40.242Z, which is a normal interaction when logging in.
4. After that, there is no further interaction or event indicating an attempt to log in, but we see that the user continued interacting with the application by clicking on the username input field again at 2025-09-27T14:11:40.242Z.
5. Finally, the user entered their credentials and completed the login process (not shown in the provided log file), which means they have successfully logged in. Since all initiated tasks were completed without abandonment, we classify this session as a conversion.
