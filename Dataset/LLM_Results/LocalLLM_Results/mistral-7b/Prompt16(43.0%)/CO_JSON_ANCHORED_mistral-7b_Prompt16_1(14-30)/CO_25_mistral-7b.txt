 Tag: Drop-Off

The session was a drop-off because the user initiated tasks (scrolling and clicking on "Menu") but did not complete any of them, as indicated by the subsequent events in the log file not showing any further interactions with the application after these initial actions.

Here is the user journey step-by-step:
1. The user visited the web application ("url": "http://localhost:5173/restaurant/dashboard/menu").
2. The user scrolled down the page ("event_name": "scroll").
3. The user clicked on the "Menu" link ("event_name": "click").
4. After these initial interactions, there are no further events indicating that the user continued to interact with the application or completed any tasks, which suggests that the session was abandoned (tag: Drop-Off).
