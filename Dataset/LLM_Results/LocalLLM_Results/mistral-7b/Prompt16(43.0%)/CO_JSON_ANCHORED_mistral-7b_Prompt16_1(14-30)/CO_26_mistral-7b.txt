 Tag: Conversion

1. The user navigates to the webpage (http://localhost:5173/restaurant/dashboard/menu). This indicates the start of their session.
2. The user clicks on the "Add Item" button, which initiates the task of adding an item to the menu.
3. The user clicks on one of the menu categories (either Starters, Main Courses, Desserts, Drinks, or Side Dishes). This action allows them to select an item to add.
4. The user chooses an item by clicking on it (in this log file, we don't see a specific choice, but assuming the user completed this step).
5. The user clicks on the "Drag image here or click to upload" area or button, initiating the process of uploading an image for the chosen item.
6. The user clicks on either a pre-existing image or the "svg" element to select an image to use for the item (in this log file, we don't see a specific choice, but assuming the user completed this step).
7. The user clicks on the "Save" or "Submit" button to finalize the addition of the item to the menu. However, there is no such action recorded in the log file. Instead, the user clicks on another part of the webpage, indicating they may have navigated away from the page without completing the task (uploading the image and saving/submitting the new item).

Since all initiated tasks were not completed, this session can be classified as a Drop-Off. The user started the process of adding an item to the menu but did not finish it by uploading an image and submitting the new item.

User Journey:
1. Navigated to the restaurant's dashboard menu page.
2. Clicked on the "Add Item" button.

6. Selected an image for the new item (not shown in the log file).
