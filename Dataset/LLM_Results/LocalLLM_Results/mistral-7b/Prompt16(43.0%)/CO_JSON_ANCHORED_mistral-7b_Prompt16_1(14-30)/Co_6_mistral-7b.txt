 Tag: Drop-Off

Reasons: The user clicked on the "Customer Login" link (Step 1), navigated to the login form (Step 2), but did not fill in any information in the username field and clicked outside of it (Steps 3 and 4). This indicates that the user did not complete the login process, which was the intended task. Since the user initiated a task (logging in) but did not complete it, this session can be classified as a drop-off.

1. User clicked on the "Customer Login" link.
2. Navigated to the login form.
3. Did not fill in any information in the username field.
4. Clicked outside of the username input field without proceeding further.
