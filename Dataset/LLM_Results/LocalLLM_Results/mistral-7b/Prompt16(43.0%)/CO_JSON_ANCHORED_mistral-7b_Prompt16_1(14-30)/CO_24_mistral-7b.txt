 Tag: Drop-Off

The session was a drop-off because the user initiated the task of navigating to the "Menu" page (Step 1), but did not complete any other tasks such as uploading an image or clicking on any of the form elements related to adding, editing, or deleting menu items. The fact that the user clicked on the "Menu" link and did not engage with any other interactive elements suggests that they may have been looking for something specific but didn't find it, or they might have decided to leave the application without taking further action.

Here is a brief outline of the user journey:

1. The user navigated to the "Menu" page (Step 1) by clicking on the "Menu" link in the navigation bar.
2. No other interactions were recorded after the initial navigation to the "Menu" page, suggesting that the user did not perform any additional actions such as uploading an image or editing menu items.
3. The session ended without any further interaction from the user, indicating a drop-off.
