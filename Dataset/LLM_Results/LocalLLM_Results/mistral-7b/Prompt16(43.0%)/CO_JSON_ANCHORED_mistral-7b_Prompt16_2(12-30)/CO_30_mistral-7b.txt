 Tag: Drop-Off

1. The user navigated to the dashboard page (/restaurant/dashboard) at 2025-09-27T15:20:35.792Z, which could be considered the start of the session.

2. The user clicked on the "History" link at 2025-09-27T15:20:43.885Z to navigate to the history page (/restaurant/dashboard/history). This could be considered Step 1 of the user journey.

3. The user clicked on a button labeled "View Details" at 2025-09-27T15:20:45.667Z, which would imply that the user intended to view details for a specific item in the history. This could be considered Step 2 of the user journey.

4. The user clicked on the "Back" button or navigated away from the page at an unspecified time, as indicated by the lack of subsequent interactions. This action is considered abandoning the initiated task (viewing details), so the session is classified as a drop-off.

Reason: The session was dropped off because the user initiated a task (viewing details) but did not complete it before navigating away from the page.
