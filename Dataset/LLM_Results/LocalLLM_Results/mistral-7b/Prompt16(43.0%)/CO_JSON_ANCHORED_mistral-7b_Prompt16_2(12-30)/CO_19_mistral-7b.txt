4. However, the log shows no further interaction related to entering password or submitting the login form, indicating that the user might have abandoned the process.

The session was dropped off because the initiated task (logging in) was not completed. The user navigated to the login page but did not proceed with the login process, suggesting they might have left the site without logging in.
