 Tag: Drop-Off

1. The user clicked on the "Settings" link (log entry #7), indicating they navigated to the settings page of the restaurant dashboard.
2. The user then clicked on a div with text "Add" (log entry #5), which is likely an attempt to add something, but no subsequent logs show that this action was completed.
3. The user clicked on another "Add" element (log entry #4), possibly trying to add another item, but again, no further logs indicate completion of this action.
4. The user clicked on an input field, which might have been an attempt to fill out a form or search box, but there's no log entry showing that they actually entered any text (log entry #3).
5. The user clicked on another "Add" element (log entry #2), again without any subsequent logs indicating completion of this action.
6. The user then left the page by clicking a link with the text "Settings" and returning to the dashboard (log entry #1).

This user session shows multiple attempts to interact with elements labeled as "Add," but no clear indication that those interactions were completed, leading to a tag of Drop-Off. The reason for this classification is that the user initiated actions intended to complete tasks, but they did not complete any of these initiated tasks before leaving the page.
