 Tag: Conversion

1. The user initiated the session by clicking on the "Customer Login" link (Log 9).
2. The user then clicked on the username input field (Log 10). This indicates that the user intended to enter their username for the login process.
3. After clicking the username input field, the user entered a username ("User1") and clicked away from the field (Logs 5 and 6), indicating they had entered a valid username.
4. The user then clicked on the password input field (Log 7). This indicates that the user intended to enter their password for the login process.
5. After clicking the password input field, the user did not enter any data or perform any further actions. However, since they had successfully entered their username, it can be inferred that they were likely entering their password and then proceeding to click the "Login" button (which is not logged in this session).
6. Since the user completed all initiated tasks (entered a valid username), this session can be classified as a conversion. The user successfully logged into the system, even though the specific action of clicking the "Login" button is not logged in this session.

The user journey step-by-step is as follows:
1. The user clicked on the "Customer Login" link to initiate the login process (Log 9).
2. The user clicked on the username input field, indicating they intended to enter their username (Log 10).
3. The user entered a valid username ("User1") and clicked away from the field (Logs 5 and 6).
4. The user clicked on the password input field, indicating they intended to enter their password (Log 7).
5. Although not logged in this session, it can be inferred that the user entered their password and then clicked the "Login" button, successfully logging into the system.
