 Tag: Drop-Off

1. The user initially visited the dashboard page (`/customer/dashboard`) at `2025-09-13T14:32:57.591Z`.
2. The user scrolled down the page to the restaurant details for ID 4, indicating potential interest in that restaurant.
3. The user clicked on the "No image available" placeholder for the restaurant's image (`log_1757773978615_bwt5ki2v4`), which suggests the user might want to see more information about that restaurant.
4. However, the user did not proceed further or interact with any other elements on the page. Instead, the user scrolled back up the page (`log_1757773977591_3etisigwv`) and then scrolled down again to the restaurant details for ID 4 (`log_1757773978615_bwt5ki2v4`), indicating indecision or lack of engagement.
5. The user eventually left the page by scrolling back up one last time (`log_1757773978718_dw1dc2kpq`) without completing any other tasks, such as clicking on the restaurant's name or making a reservation.

Therefore, it seems that the user did not complete any initiated tasks, so this session is classified as a drop-off. The reason for this classification is that the user showed initial interest but did not proceed to complete any actions indicating a desire to engage further with the platform or make a reservation at a specific restaurant.
