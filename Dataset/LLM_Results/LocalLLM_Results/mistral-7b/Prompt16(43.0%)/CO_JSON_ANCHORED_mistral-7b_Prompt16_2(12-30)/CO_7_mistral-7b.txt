 Tag: Drop-Off

Reason: The user initiated the task of navigating to the Customer Login page, but did not complete it by entering a username or password and clicking the "Sign In" button. Instead, the user clicked on other elements on the page, suggesting exploration or potential confusion, but ultimately abandoned the login process.

User Journey:
1. The user clicked on the "Customer Login" link, initiating the login task (Step 1).
2. The user then navigated to the username input field but did not enter any information (Step 2).
3. The user clicked on the username input field, suggesting they intended to enter a username, but then they clicked away from it (Step 3).
4. The user moved their cursor to the password input field but did not interact with it (Step 4).
5. The user clicked on other elements within the form, such as the "Sign In" button and the label for the password input field, indicating potential confusion or exploration, but ultimately did not complete the login process by clicking the "Sign In" button (Step 5-6 onwards).
