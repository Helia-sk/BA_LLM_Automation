 Tag: Drop-Off

The session was a drop-off because the user initiated several tasks but did not complete any of them. Specifically, the user clicked on various elements within the menu page (steps 1, 2, and 4), but no form submission was recorded (steps 3 and 5). This suggests that the user may have been exploring or browsing but did not take any action to finalize an order or save changes.

User Journey:
1. [Step 1] The user clicked on the "Menu" link located at x = 586, y = 124 (Log ID: log_1758985327601_v0m4u6hq3). This action led them to the menu page.
2. [Step 2] The user clicked on an "svg" element at x = 664, y = 338 (Log ID: log_1758985330432_e2cyil3bd). This action may indicate that the user was interacting with some visual elements on the page.
3. [Step 3] The user clicked on a "FORM" element but no form submission was recorded (Log ID: log_1758985331764_8nlogiyec). This suggests that the user might have intended to fill out a form, but did not complete it.
4. [Step 4] The user clicked on various elements within the menu page multiple times (Log IDs: log_1758985330432_oymp343kw, log_1758985331764_8nlogiyec). This behavior could indicate that the user was still exploring or browsing the menu without any clear intention to complete a task.
5. [Step 5] The session ended with no form submission or save changes (Log IDs: log_1758985330432_oymp343kw, log_1758985331764_8nlogiyec). This action confirms that the user did not complete any task and thus classifies this session as a drop-off.
