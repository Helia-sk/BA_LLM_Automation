 Tag: Conversion

The session can be classified as a conversion because all the initiated tasks were completed in this case. The user clicked on the "Customer Login" link, navigated to the login page, and then filled out the username field and successfully submitted it. After that, there are no more events indicating any other task initiation or abandonment.

Here's a step-by-step user journey:
1. The user clicked on the "Customer Login" link from the homepage (log event with id `log_1757772635942`).
2. Upon clicking the link, the user was redirected to the login page (no specific log event for this step as it's an implicit action resulting from clicking the "Customer Login" link).
3. The user clicked on the username input field on the login page (log event with id `log_1757772641131`).
4. The user started typing their username and triggered a debounce function, which emitted log events with the 'debounce' event_type as they were typing (not shown in the provided logs).
5. After entering their username, the user clicked on the submit button (log event with id `log_1757772640938`). This event indicates that the form submission was successful and the user has completed the login process.

Since all initiated tasks were completed without any abandonment, this session can be classified as a conversion.
