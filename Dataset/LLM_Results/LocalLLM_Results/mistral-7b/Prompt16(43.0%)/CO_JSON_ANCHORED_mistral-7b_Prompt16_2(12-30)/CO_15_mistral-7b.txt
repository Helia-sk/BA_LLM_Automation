 Tag: Drop-Off

1. The user visited the homepage ("/") at 2025-09-27T14:11:22.530Z, indicating the start of a new session. This is the first step in the user journey.
2. The user clicked on the "Customer Login" link, which took them to the login page ("/customer/login") at 2025-09-27T14:11:39.417Z. This is the second step in the user journey.
3. The user then interacted with the username input field on the login page by clicking it at 2025-09-27T14:11:40.242Z, but no further interaction or submission of the login form was recorded. This suggests that the user abandoned the login process, which makes this a drop-off rather than a conversion.

The reason for classifying this as a drop-off is that the initiated task (logging in) was not fully completed; the user clicked on the login link and interacted with the username input field but did not submit the form or continue with any other actions.
