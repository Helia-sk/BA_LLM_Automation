 Tag: Drop-Off

The session can be classified as a drop-off because, although the user initiated several interactions (clicks on buttons), they did not complete any task fully. For instance, the user clicked on "History" and then navigated to the "View Details" page, but there is no record of them returning to complete that action or performing any other actions on the "View Details" page before leaving the site.

Here is a summary of the user journey:

1. The user accessed the restaurant dashboard (URL: http://localhost:5173/restaurant/dashboard/history).
2. The user clicked on the "History" link in the navigation menu, indicating an interest in viewing the history of orders or events.
3. The user navigated to a new page ("View Details") after clicking on the "View Details" button for one of the items listed under "History".
4. There is no record of any further interaction with the "View Details" page, suggesting that the user left the site without completing any actions on this page or returning to the previous page (dashboard).
5. The session ended without any completion of tasks initiated by the user.
