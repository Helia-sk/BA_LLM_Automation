==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off

1. The user initially visits the customer dashboard page ("/customer/dashboard") at timestamp "2025-09-13T14:37:56.450Z".
2. After scrolling through the dashboard, the user navigates to a specific restaurant page ("/customer/dashboard/restaurant/[id]"). However, there is no further activity related to this specific restaurant page in the log.
3. The user then scrolls back up to the customer dashboard and continues scrolling down ("scroll" events at different y-coordinates). This indicates that the user might have been looking for more information or options but didn't find what they were looking for.
4. Finally, the user leaves the application by navigating away from the site (not present in the log file).

The session was a drop-off because although the user initiated a task (navigating to a specific restaurant page), they did not complete it, and ultimately left the application without completing any other tasks.
