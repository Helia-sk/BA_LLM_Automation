 Tag: Conversion

The session was a conversion because all initiated tasks were completed. The user clicked on the "Customer Login" link (step 5), which led to the username input field being clicked twice (steps 8 and 9). This was followed by typing "User1" into the username input field (steps 10, 13, and 14) and clicking the submit button (step 15), indicating a successful login.

1. [Step 1] The user navigated to the customer login page (URL: http://localhost:5173/customer/login).
2. [Step 2] The user clicked on the "Customer Login" link (URL: http://localhost:5173/customer/login, A tag with text "Customer Login").
3. [Step 3] The user clicked on the username input field (ID: username, INPUT tag).
4. [Step 4] The user typed "User1" into the username input field (INPUT tag, events at steps 10, 13, and 14).
5. [Step 5] The user clicked on the username input field again (repeated step 3), possibly to correct or confirm the entered username.
6. [Step 6] The user clicked the submit button (ID: undefined, A tag at step 15).
7. [Step 7] The system processed the login request and presumably allowed the user access to their account, indicating a successful conversion.
