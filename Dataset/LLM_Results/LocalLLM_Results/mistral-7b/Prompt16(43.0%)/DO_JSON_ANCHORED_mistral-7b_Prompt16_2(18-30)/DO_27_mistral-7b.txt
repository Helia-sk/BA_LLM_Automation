 Tag: Drop-Off

Explanation: The user initiated the tasks to log in and manage orders, but these tasks were not completed. Specifically, the user clicked on the "Restaurant PartnersRegister your restaurant or log in to manage orders" link and navigated to the login page, then clicked on the "Sign In" button, entered a username ("User1") but did not enter a password. This indicates that the login process was started but not completed, so it appears that the user abandoned this task (logged in) and the session ended as a drop-off.

User Journey:
1. The user navigated to the Restaurant Partners login/register page.
2. The user clicked on the "Restaurant PartnersRegister your restaurant or log in to manage orders" link, which took them to the login page.
3. The user clicked on the "Sign In" button to begin the login process.
4. The user entered a username ("User1") but did not enter a password, indicating that they did not complete the login process and abandoned the session.
