 Tag: Drop-Off

The session was a drop-off because the user initiated the task of logging in or registering their restaurant, but they did not complete it. The user clicked on the "Restaurant Partners" link, which is associated with the login/registration process, but no subsequent actions related to completing this task were logged.

Here's a summary of the user journey:
1. The user navigated to the Restaurant Partners page (implied from the URL).
2. The user clicked on the "Restaurant Partners" link, indicating an intent to register or log in.
3. However, no subsequent actions related to completing this task were logged, suggesting that the user did not proceed with registration/login.
4. After this, there are only navigation events (clicks) within the page, but no further interactions related to the login/registration process were recorded. This indicates that the user did not complete the intended task and abandoned the session.
