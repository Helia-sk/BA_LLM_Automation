 Tag: Drop-Off

The session was a drop-off because the user initiated the task of logging in or registering a restaurant, but they did not complete it. The user clicked on the "Restaurant Partners" link and then clicked on the "Register your restaurant or log in to manage orders" text, which indicates an intention to log in or register. However, the log file does not show any subsequent action that would indicate a successful login or registration. Instead, the user clicked on the username input field, which could suggest an attempt to start the process, but there is no evidence of this action being completed.

User Journey:
1. The user visited the "/restaurant/login" page (indicated by the first log entry).
2. The user clicked on the "Restaurant Partners" link (log entry 5). This could have been an attempt to navigate to a different part of the site or to access more information about partnering with the platform.
3. The user then clicked on the "Register your restaurant or log in to manage orders" text, which is typically a call-to-action for logging in or registering (log entry 6). This suggests an intention to interact further with the site.
4. The user clicked on the username input field, but this action was not followed by any other actions that would indicate a successful login or registration (log entries 8 and 9).
5. The user did not take any further actions in the session, suggesting that they abandoned their attempt to log in or register.
