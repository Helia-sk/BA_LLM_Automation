 Tag: Conversion

The session can be classified as a conversion because all the initiated tasks were completed by the user. The sequence of events shows that the user clicked on the "History" link, but then immediately navigated to the "Settings" page and performed an action there (indicated by the click event). This could be interpreted as the user changing settings or viewing them, which is a meaningful interaction with the application. After that, the user interacted with several select elements on the Settings page, indicating further engagement with the application.

User Journey:
1. The user clicked on the "History" link (indicating an interest in viewing past activities).
2. Immediately after, the user navigated to the "Settings" page by clicking on a different link.
3. On the Settings page, the user interacted with multiple select elements, suggesting that they were exploring and modifying settings within the application.
