 Tag: Drop-Off

The session was a drop-off because the user initiated the task of clicking on the link "Hungry? Order delicious food from local restaurants" but did not complete any further tasks that would indicate a full conversion, such as filling out a form or placing an order. The subsequent actions (scrolling and navigation) can be considered natural user behavior when exploring a website, rather than steps towards a specific goal.

Here is the step-by-step user journey:

1. The user landed on the homepage of the website ("/").
2. The user scrolled down the page to view more content ("scroll" event).
3. The user clicked on a link inviting them to order food ("click" event).
4. The user scrolled again, indicating they were navigating within the ordered food section of the site ("scroll" event). However, this navigation does not constitute a completed task as it does not correspond to filling out an order form or placing an order. This is the last recorded action in the log file, which suggests that the user did not proceed with their intended action.
5. The user returned to the homepage by clicking on the back button or navigating back via browser history ("scroll" event on the homepage). This event could be due to the user deciding they do not want to order food, or it might simply mean that the user wanted to explore other sections of the website.

Since the user initiated the task of ordering food but did not complete this task, we classify this session as a drop-off.
