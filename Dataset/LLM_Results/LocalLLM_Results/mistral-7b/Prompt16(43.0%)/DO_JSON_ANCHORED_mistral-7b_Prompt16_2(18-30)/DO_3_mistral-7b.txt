 Tag: Conversion

The session was a conversion because the user initiated and completed all the tasks in the user journey, which includes clicking on the "Customer Login" link (log entry 8), entering their username (logs 6 & 7), and password (not shown in logs but implied by the successful login), and finally successfully logging in as indicated by the subsequent "input_change" events for the password field (logs 4, 5).

Here's a step-by-step user journey:

1. The user navigated to the website homepage (not shown in logs)
2. The user clicked on the "Customer Login" link (log entry 8)
3. The user entered their username in the username input field (log entries 6 & 7)
4. The user triggered a 'debounced_input' event for the username field, indicating continued input (log entry 2)
5. The user clicked outside of the username field, completing the action and triggering a 'click' event (log entry 1)
6. The user entered their password in the password input field (not shown in logs but implied by the subsequent successful login)
7. The user triggered a 'debounced_input' event for the password field, indicating continued input (log entry 5)
8. The user clicked outside of the password field, completing the action and triggering a 'click' event (not shown in logs but implied by the subsequent successful login)
9. The user successfully logged in, as indicated by the subsequent "input_change" events for the password field (logs 4, 5).

The user initiated and completed all tasks, therefore this session was a conversion.
