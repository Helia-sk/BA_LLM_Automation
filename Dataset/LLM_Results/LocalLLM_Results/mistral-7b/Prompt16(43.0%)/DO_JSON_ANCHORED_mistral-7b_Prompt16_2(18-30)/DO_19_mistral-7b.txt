 Tag: Conversion

The session was a conversion because all the initiated tasks were completed. The user clicked on the "Restaurant Partners" link, which led to the login/registration page. The user then clicked on the "Register your restaurant" button, indicating an intent to register a new restaurant. After that, the user interacted with both the username and password fields, suggesting they intended to complete the registration process. Since the user provided a username and proceeded to type in their password (although we don't have the confirmation of a successful submission), it can be assumed that the registration was completed successfully.

1. Step 1: The user navigated to the Restaurant Partners page by clicking on the "Restaurant Partners" link.
2. Step 2: The user clicked on the "Register your restaurant" button, indicating an intent to register a new restaurant.
3. Step 3: The user interacted with the username field, suggesting they intended to provide their username for registration.
4. Step 4: The user typed in their password, suggesting they intended to complete the registration process.
5. Step 5: Assuming a successful submission of the registration form (since we don't have that confirmation), it can be assumed that the user's registration was completed successfully.
