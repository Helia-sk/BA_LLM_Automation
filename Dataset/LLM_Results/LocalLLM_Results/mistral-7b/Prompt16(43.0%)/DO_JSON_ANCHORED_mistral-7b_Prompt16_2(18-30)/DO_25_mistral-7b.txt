 Tag: Drop-Off

1. The user first clicked on the "Restaurant Login" link (log_1757766826727_nc9nu1zz0), indicating the start of a session and an initiated task.

2. Next, the user clicked on the username input field (log_1757766827830_dlftq2kky), suggesting that they were about to enter their login credentials. However, this was not followed by any further actions related to entering password or submitting the form.

3. The user then clicked on the username input field again (log_1757766827830_xz1xlxgoo), which could indicate that they were trying to correct something, but no subsequent actions were taken.

4. Finally, the user left the page without any further interaction (not shown in log). Since the intended task of logging into the restaurant was not completed, we classify this session as a drop-off.

The reason for this classification is that the initiated task (logging in) was abandoned and no subsequent tasks were completed.
