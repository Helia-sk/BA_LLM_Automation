 Tag: Drop-Off

1. The user initially scrolled on the homepage (log_1757763606219_urtfqnl53).
2. The user clicked on the "Customer Login" button (log_1757763607141_b8d9wpx89), indicating the start of the customer login task.
3. However, there is no subsequent log related to the completion of the customer login process, such as entering a username or password or clicking on the "Submit" button for this task. Instead, the user scrolled again (log_1757763605641_i0oqvjrbd), which could indicate that they abandoned the customer login task without completing it.

Since one of the initiated tasks (customer login) was abandoned, the session is classified as a drop-off. The user did not complete their intended action (logging in as a customer).
