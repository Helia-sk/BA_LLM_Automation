 Tag: Conversion

The session in the provided log file indicates a conversion because all initiated tasks were completed by the user. Here is the detailed user journey:

1. The user navigated to the homepage (http://localhost:5173/) and clicked on the "Customer Login" link, initiating the login process.
2. After clicking the "Customer Login" link, the user landed on the login page, where they clicked the username input field to start typing their username.
3. The user entered the username as "User1" and then clicked outside of the input field, triggering a 'debounced_input' event.
4. The user then clicked inside the password input field to enter their password but did not provide any text, indicating that they might have just been positioning the cursor for typing later. However, we don't have information about whether or not they finished entering their password.
5. Finally, the user clicked on the login button, submitting the form and presumably logging into the system successfully.

It appears that the user completed all initiated tasks (logging in) without any apparent abandonment, making this a conversion session.
