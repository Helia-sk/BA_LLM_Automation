Explanation: The user initially visited the homepage, scrolled down and clicked on a link to navigate to the "/" page again, suggesting they might have been looking for something specific. However, the user did not initiate any other tasks that could be considered completed, such as logging in or placing an order. Instead, the user seemed to have abandoned the session after navigating to the "/customer/login" page, as indicated by multiple scroll events without any clicks or actions taken on the login form.

User Journey:
1. The user visited the homepage (http://localhost:5173/) and scrolled down to view the content.
2. The user clicked on a link to navigate back to the homepage (http://localhost:5173/).
3. The user navigated to the login page (http://localhost:5173/customer/login) but did not provide any login credentials or take any further action, suggesting they abandoned the session.
