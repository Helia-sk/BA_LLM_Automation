 Tag: Conversion

The session was a conversion because all the initiated tasks were completed. The user clicked on the "Lieferspatz" logo (Step 1), which led to the homepage, then clicked on the "Customer Login" link (Step 2), and finally clicked twice on the "Customer Login" button (Steps 3 and 4). After that, there were no further events indicating abandonment of the process.

Here is the step-by-step user journey:
1. The user clicked on the "Lieferspatz" logo, which led to the homepage (http://localhost:5173/).
2. The user then clicked on the "Customer Login" link, navigating to the customer login page (http://localhost:5173/customer/login).
3. The user clicked on the "Customer Login" button, initiating the login process.
4. The user clicked again on the "Customer Login" button, submitting the login form and completing the login process.

The user completed all initiated tasks (logging in), so the session was a conversion.
