 Tag: Drop-Off

The session was a drop-off because the user initiated tasks, but not all of them were completed. The user clicked on the "Restaurant" link at "/customer/dashboard", implying they started browsing restaurants (Step 1). They scrolled down to view more content, but did not click on any restaurant listing or image (Steps 2 and 3). Instead, they scrolled back up to the top of the page, indicating they might have decided to leave without further interaction (Step 4). The user then clicked on the "Restaurants" link again at "/customer/dashboard", suggesting another attempt to browse restaurants (Step 5). However, they only scrolled down and did not click on any listing or image before leaving the page. This pattern of scrolling and clicking without completing a task indicates that the user was browsing but eventually dropped off.
