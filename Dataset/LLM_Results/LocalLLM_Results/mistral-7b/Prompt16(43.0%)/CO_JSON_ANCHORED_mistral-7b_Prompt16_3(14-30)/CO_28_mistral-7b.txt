 Tag: Conversion

1. The user visited the login page (`/restaurant/login`) and submitted a form (`form_submit` event). This indicates that the user intended to sign in.

2. After signing in, the user navigated to the dashboard page (presumably `/restaurant/dashboard` since no such event is visible in the log) as they interacted with various UI elements on the page like buttons and input fields.

3. The user then navigated to the specific page where the `form_submit` event was initiated, which is `/restaurant/login`. Since this action (submitting a form) was completed successfully, it can be inferred that the user intended to proceed to the dashboard and had accomplished that goal.

4. Finally, the user interacted with various UI elements on the dashboard page, demonstrating engagement and continued interaction with the application, which suggests that they are still actively using the app.

Since all initiated tasks were completed (signing in and further interactions on the dashboard), we can classify this session as a conversion. The user successfully signed in and engaged with the application beyond the initial login process.
