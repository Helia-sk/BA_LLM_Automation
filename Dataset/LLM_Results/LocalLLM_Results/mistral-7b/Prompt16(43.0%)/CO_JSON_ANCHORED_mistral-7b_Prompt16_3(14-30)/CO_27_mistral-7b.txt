Prompt: Analyze the following log file. Determine if the session was a drop-off or a conversion.Consider every initiated task, A task counts as a conversion only if it is fully completed.

Then, outline the user journey step-by-step.Format your response as follows:
Tag: Conversion || Drop-Off ||  [Reason].
1. [Step 1]

3. [Step 3] …
==================================================

 Tag: Conversion

The session was classified as a conversion because all initiated tasks were completed. The user first made an HTTP request to accept an order (step 1), and then the server responded with a successful status code 200 (step 2). After that, on the frontend, there were two click events, one on a button labeled "Accept" and another on an SVG element (steps 3 and 4 respectively). Both of these clicks correspond to actions taken by the user in response to the server's acceptance of the order.

User Journey:
1. The user initiated an HTTP request to accept an order through the backend API (route "/api/orders/26/accept").
2. The server responded with a successful status code 200, indicating that the order was accepted.
3. On the frontend, the user clicked on a button labeled "Accept" in response to the server's acceptance of the order.
4. On the frontend, the user also clicked on an SVG element, which is likely a part of the UI for confirming or visualizing the accepted order.
