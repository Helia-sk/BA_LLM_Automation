 Tag: Drop-Off

The session was dropped off because the user initiated multiple tasks but did not complete any of them. The tasks include clicking on the "Menu" link, uploading an image for a menu item, and interacting with various form elements (such as clicking on the form and the SVG icon) associated with adding or editing menu items. However, there is no evidence in the log file that these tasks were fully completed.

Here's a summary of the user journey:
1. The user navigated to the "Menu" page. [Step 1]
2. The user clicked on the "Menu" link. [Step 2]
3. The user interacted with the upload image area, suggesting an attempt to add or edit a menu item. [Step 3]
4. The user clicked on various form elements (form and SVG icon), indicating further interactions with the page. However, there is no indication that any forms were submitted or items were successfully added/edited. [Steps 4 - ?]
5. The session ended without any further interaction suggesting that the user left the application without completing any tasks. [Step n]
