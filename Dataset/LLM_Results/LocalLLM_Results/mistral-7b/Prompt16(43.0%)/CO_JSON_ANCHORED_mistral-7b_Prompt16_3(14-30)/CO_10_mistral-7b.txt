 Tag: Conversion

The session was a conversion because all initiated tasks were completed. The user clicked on the "Balance" link, which led to the balance page, and then clicked on the "View Details" button associated with an order, indicating they were viewing the details of that specific order. Afterward, the user clicked on the "Orders" link, which would take them back to their orders page, but this does not count as a new task since the user had already visited the orders page earlier in the session. Finally, the user clicked on the "View Details" button again for another order, indicating they were viewing the details of another order as well. This is considered completing a task, as viewing the details of an order can be seen as interacting with that specific order and not just browsing.
