 Tag: Drop-Off

1. The user (anonymous) initiated a session by visiting the restaurant dashboard page (log_1758985593634).
2. The user clicked on the "Add Item" button, indicating an intention to add a new menu item (log_1758985597816).
3. The user navigated to the section where they could either drag and drop or click to upload an image for the new item (log_1758985597527). However, there is no log indicating that the user successfully uploaded an image or continued with adding details for the item.
4. The user clicked on a menu item listing (log_1758985597527), but this does not count towards adding a new item to the menu.
5. The user clicked on another "Add Item" button, which suggests an intention to add another new item, but there is no further activity indicating the completion of this task.
6. Finally, the user clicked on an SVG element without any clear indication of what action it initiated (log_1758985593634).

Since the user did not complete the intended task of adding a new menu item and there is no other evidence of completing other tasks, the session can be classified as a drop-off. The reason for this classification is that the user initiated an action but did not complete it.
