 Tag: Drop-Off

The session was a drop-off because the user initiated two tasks (clicking on "Restaurant Login" and clicking on the username input field), but did not complete either of them. The user abandoned the session after clicking on the username input field, which indicates that they did not enter any username or password to log in.

User Journey:
1. [Step 1] User clicked on the "Restaurant Login" link located at x = 470, y = 42. This step represents the user's decision to access the login page of the restaurant website.
2. [Step 2] User navigated to the login form by clicking on the username input field. This step indicates that the user intended to enter their login credentials. However, the user did not complete this step, signifying that they abandoned the session without logging in.
3. [Step 3] (Uncompleted) User would have entered their username and password if they had chosen to continue with the login process. Since they did not complete this step, we can infer that they left the website after clicking on the username input field.
