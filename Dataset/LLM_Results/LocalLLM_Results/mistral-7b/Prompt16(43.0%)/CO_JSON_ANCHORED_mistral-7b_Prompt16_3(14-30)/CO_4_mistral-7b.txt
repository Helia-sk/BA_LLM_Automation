==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off

Reasons for classification: The user clicked on the "Restaurant Login" link (Step 1), filled out a form to sign up (Step 2), but did not complete the process by clicking the submit button or signing in with an existing account. Instead, the user clicked the link "Already have an account? Sign in" (Step 3) which indicates an intent to sign in, but there is no further evidence of completion of this action. Since the main goal of the session (logging in or signing up) was not achieved, it's considered a drop-off.

User Journey:
1. Clicked on "Restaurant Login" link.
2. Filled out the signup form with the input field for username and clicked the "username" input field.
3. Clicked the link "Already have an account? Sign in" which indicates an intent to sign in, but did not complete the process further, resulting in a drop-off.
