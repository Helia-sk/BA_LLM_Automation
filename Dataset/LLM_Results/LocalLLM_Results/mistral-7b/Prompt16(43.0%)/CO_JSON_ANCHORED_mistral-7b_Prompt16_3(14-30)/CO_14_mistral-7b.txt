 Tag: Conversion

1. The user navigates to the homepage (indicated by log_1758982001023_zzkgn108u).
2. The user clicks on the "Customer Login" button, initiating the login process (log_1758982001023_zzkgn108u).
3. The user then navigates to the login form, as indicated by multiple click events on the username input field (logs: log_1758982001809_u5d0yu5q9, log_1758982001809_sinkyvxay).
4. The user enters their username in the login form (logs: log_1758982003418_3owdv9ltz, log_1758982003418_3owdv9ltz).
5. The user does not abandon the session and continues to the password input field (logs: log_1758982001809_u5d0yu5q9, log_1758982001809_sinkyvxay).
6. The user enters their password in the login form (logs: log_1758982003418_3owdv9ltz, log_1758982003418_3owdv9ltz).
7. The user successfully logs into the application, as indicated by no further events related to the login process (no subsequent logs related to username or password input fields).

Since all initiated tasks in this session were completed without abandonment, we can classify this session as a conversion.
