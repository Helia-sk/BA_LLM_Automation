 Tag: Drop-Off

The session was a drop-off because although the user initiated several tasks, such as clicking on the "History" link and viewing details, they ultimately abandoned the session by closing the browser. Since one of the initiated tasks (viewing details) was not completed, this indicates that the user did not fully engage with the intended action.

1. Step 1: The user navigated to the restaurant dashboard page ("/restaurant/dashboard").
2. Step 2: The user clicked on the "History" link located at position (676, 126) within the dashboard page.
3. Step 3: The user viewed the details for a specific item by clicking on the "View Details" button located at position (1538, 298).
4. Step 4: The user abandoned the session by closing the browser without completing any other tasks.
