 Tag: Drop-Off

The session can be classified as a drop-off because the user initiated several tasks, such as clicking on the "History", "View Details", and "X" buttons, but did not complete any of them. The user clicked on the "X" button to close a dialog box, which indicates that they may have abandoned their actions.

1. [Step 1] - User navigated to the restaurant dashboard's history page by clicking the "History" link (log entry: log_1757835951066_df53zrrdx).
2. [Step 2] - User clicked on a history item to view its details, but instead of completing the action, they clicked on the "X" button to close the dialog box (log entry: log_1757835961979_hw4mtgead).
3. [Step 3] - User briefly considered viewing more details by hovering over another history item's "View Details" button, but did not click on it (implied in log entry: log_1757835963781_2e9f53t2n).
4. [Step 4] - User clicked on the "X" button again to close another dialog box, possibly indicating a decision to abandon their actions (log entry: log_1757835963781_2e9f53t2n).
