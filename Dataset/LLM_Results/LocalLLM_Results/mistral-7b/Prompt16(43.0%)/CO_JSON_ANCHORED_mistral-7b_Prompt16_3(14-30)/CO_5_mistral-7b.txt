 Tag: Conversion

The session was a conversion because all the initiated tasks were completed. The user navigated to the homepage (Step 1), scrolled down the page (Step 2), clicked on the "Customer Login" link (Step 3), and then entered the login information, which is indicated by the "Content-to-Key" event. After entering the login information, there are no further events indicating that the user abandoned the task or navigated away from the page, which suggests that they successfully logged in, thus completing their intended action.

Here's a detailed breakdown of the user journey:

1. The user initiated a new session by visiting the homepage ("http://localhost:5173/").
2. The user scrolled down the homepage to view its content (indicated by the "scroll" event).
3. The user clicked on the "Customer Login" link, which led them to the login page for the customer portal ("http://localhost:5173/customer/login").
4. The user entered their login credentials and triggered the "Content-to-Key" event, indicating that they successfully logged in to the customer portal.

Since all initiated tasks were completed without any evidence of abandonment, this session can be classified as a conversion.
