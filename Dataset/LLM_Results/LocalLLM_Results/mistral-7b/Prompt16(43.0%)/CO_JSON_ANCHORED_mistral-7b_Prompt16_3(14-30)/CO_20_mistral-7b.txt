The session was a conversion because all the initiated tasks were completed by the user. The user first clicked on the link to access the website (log entry #5), then clicked on the 'Hungry? Order delicious food from local restaurants' call-to-action button (log entry #9), which led them to the login form. The user then clicked on both the username and password fields in the login form, indicating they were entering their credentials (logs entries #10 and #11). Lastly, the user clicked the submit button (log entry #12), which successfully logged them in and completed all initiated tasks.
