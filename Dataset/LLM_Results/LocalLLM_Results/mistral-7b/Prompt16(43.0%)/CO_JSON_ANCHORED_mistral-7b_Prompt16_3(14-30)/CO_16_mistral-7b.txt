 Tag: Conversion

The session was classified as a conversion because all the initiated tasks were completed. The user clicked on the "Customer Login" link, which led to focusing on the username input field (indicating an attempt to log in), then clicking the username input field, and finally typing something into the password input field. This sequence of actions suggests that the user intended to log in and successfully completed the process.

Here is the detailed user journey:
1. [Step 1] The user clicked on the "Customer Login" link, which was the first action in the session.
2. [Step 2] The user focused on the username input field, which usually indicates an attempt to enter a username for login.
3. [Step 3] The user clicked the username input field again (possibly to remove any focus or selection), and then typed something into the password input field, which is the next step in a typical login process. This action implies that the user has successfully logged in and continued with their intended actions on the site.
