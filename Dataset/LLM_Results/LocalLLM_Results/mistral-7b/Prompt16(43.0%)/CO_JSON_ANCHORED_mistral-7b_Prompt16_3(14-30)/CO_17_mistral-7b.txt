 Tag: Conversion

1. The user first navigated to the home page ("/customer/dashboard") and clicked on the "Restaurants" link, indicating an intention to explore restaurants.

2. After clicking on "Restaurants", the user was redirected to a new page displaying a list of restaurants ("/customer/dashboard/restaurant").

3. On the restaurant page, the user scrolled down to view the content and clicked on a specific restaurant, which took them to the restaurant's details page ("/customer/dashboard/restaurant/9").

4. On the restaurant's details page, the user clicked on the image placeholder (No image available), which may have been an intention to view the restaurant's image if one was available. However, since there was no image to click through to, this action could not be considered a completed task.

5. After clicking on the image placeholder, the user scrolled down on the restaurant details page and then scrolled back up. This suggests that they were still engaging with the content on the page.

6. The user then clicked on the "Add to Cart" button, which is typically a critical step towards completing a purchase or converting.

7. After adding the restaurant to their cart, the user scrolled again and finally clicked on the "Continue Shopping" button, indicating that they were not yet done shopping and wanted to explore more restaurants.

Since all initiated tasks (navigating to a specific restaurant's page, viewing the image placeholder, adding the restaurant to the cart, and continuing shopping) were completed by the user, this session can be classified as a conversion. The user showed interest in the platform, explored a restaurant, added it to their cart, and chose to continue shopping, suggesting a genuine intention to complete a purchase or engage further with the website.
