 Tag: Drop-Off

Reason: The session was initiated with a page view ("/") at 14:18:55, followed by a click on the "Customer Login" link at 14:19:05.841. After this, there were multiple interactions with the login form (clicking the username field and password field), but no further actions suggesting completion of the login process or any subsequent tasks. Since not all initiated tasks were completed, it can be classified as a drop-off.
