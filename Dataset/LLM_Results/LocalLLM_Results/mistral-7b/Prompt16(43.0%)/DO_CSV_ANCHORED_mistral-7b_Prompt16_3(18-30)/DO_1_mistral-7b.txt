Then, outline the user journey step-by-step.Format your response as follows:

 Tag: Drop-Off

1. The user initiates a task by navigating to the customer login page (log_1757763455454).
2. The user clicks on the "Customer Login" link (log_1757763455454), indicating an intent to start the login process.
3. The user then interacts with the username input field by clicking it (log_1757763456645). This could indicate that the user is preparing to enter their username for the login process.
4. However, after clicking the username input field, no further actions related to the login process are recorded in the log file. The user does not enter a username or password, and there is no record of them clicking the submit button or any other action that would complete the login process.
5. Therefore, since the user initiated a task (logging in) but did not complete it, we classify this session as a drop-off.

Reason: The user initiated the login process but did not complete it, indicating that they dropped off during the session.
