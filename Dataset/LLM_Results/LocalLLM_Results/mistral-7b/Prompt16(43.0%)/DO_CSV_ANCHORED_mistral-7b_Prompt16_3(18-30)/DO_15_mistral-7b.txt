1. The user first visits the restaurant login page (/restaurant/login).
2. They initiate an input_change event on the username field, entering the character "d". This indicates that they have started to enter their username.
3. After this, there is a debounced_input event, which means the user continued typing but did not complete the entry.
4. The next event is a click event on the username input field, but this does not suggest that the user has completed entering their username as no input_change event followed indicating a full username input.
5. The user then clicks on the "Sign In" button, but since they did not complete the input for the username, the login process cannot be considered as fully completed. This suggests that the user abandoned the login process.
6. After clicking the "Sign In" button, no further events are observed in the log file, indicating that the user did not proceed with any other tasks on the site after attempting to log in.
