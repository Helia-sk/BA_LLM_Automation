 Tag: Drop-Off

1. The user navigated to the login page of the restaurant's website (log_1757765943435_rds4a9494) and clicked on the username input field (log_1757765942985_0i7yf1mkx). This suggests that the user initiated the login process.
2. The user clicked on the password input field (not shown in logs), but it's reasonable to assume that this step would follow the username click event. However, there are no further events indicating that the user entered a password and proceeded with the login.
3. The user clicked on the 'UsernamePasswordSign In' button (log_1757765942985_0i7yf1mkx), which is expected after entering both the username and password. However, this click event doesn't indicate that the user successfully logged in, as there are no subsequent events suggesting a successful login or further interaction with the site after this point.

The session was dropped off because the user initiated the login process but didn't complete it by entering a password and submitting the form. The lack of subsequent interactions suggests that the user left the website without logging in.
