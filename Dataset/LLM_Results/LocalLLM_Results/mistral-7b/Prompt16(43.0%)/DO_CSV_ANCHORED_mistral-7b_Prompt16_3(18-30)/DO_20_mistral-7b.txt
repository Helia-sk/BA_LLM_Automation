 Tag: Drop-Off

1. The user initiated a session by clicking on the "Restaurant Login" link (log_1757766339479_qjji3gopf).
2. The user then clicked on the username input field to start typing their username (log_1757766339479_80jvspqym, log_1757766340749_any7m0yoq).
3. The user typed "User" into the username field (log_1757766342391_l3754eeil, log_1757766340749_80jvspqym).
4. The user clicked on the password input field to start typing their password (log_1757766340749_80jvspqym, log_1757766342391_any7m0yoq).
5. The user typed "User1" into the password field and then stopped typing (log_1757766342391_l3754eeil, log_1757766340749_any7m0yoq).

The session was a drop-off because the user initiated tasks but did not complete the login process by providing a valid username and password. The user stopped typing in the password field after entering "User1," which suggests that they may have made an error or decided not to proceed further.
