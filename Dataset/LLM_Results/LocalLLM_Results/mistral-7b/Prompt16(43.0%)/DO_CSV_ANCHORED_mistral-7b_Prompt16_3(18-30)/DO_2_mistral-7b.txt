 Tag: Drop-Off

1. The user started a session (session_1757763080934_tj3hw6dyl) and navigated to the restaurant login page ("/restaurant/login"). They clicked on the "Restaurant Login" button, indicating an initiated task.

2. The user then navigated to the customer login page ("/customer/login") by clicking on the "Customer Login" button, initiating another task. However, there is no subsequent log entry suggesting that they completed this task (e.g., successful login).

3. The user performed a scroll event on the current page, indicating possible interaction or exploration but not a fully completed task.

4. The user scrolled back to the homepage ("/") without any other significant actions, which suggests they abandoned the session without completing any tasks.

Since all initiated tasks (Restaurant Login and Customer Login) were abandoned, this is classified as a Drop-Off. The user did not complete any task fully.
