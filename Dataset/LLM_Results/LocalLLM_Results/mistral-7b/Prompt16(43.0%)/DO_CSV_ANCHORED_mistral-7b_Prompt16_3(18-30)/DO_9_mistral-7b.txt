 Tag: Drop-Off

1. The user initiated the session by navigating to the customer login page (log_1757764322512_gdkx56y2p).
2. The user clicked on the username input field (log_1757764323386_u7cqrk0al). This could be considered as step 1 of entering their username.
3. The user clicked on the password input field, which indicates they are preparing to enter their password (log_1757764323386_u7cqrk0al). However, this is not a fully completed task because there's no log entry showing that they actually entered their password.
4. The user did not perform any further actions related to the login process in the provided logs.

Since the user initiated the login process but did not complete it (by entering and submitting their password), this session can be classified as a drop-off.
