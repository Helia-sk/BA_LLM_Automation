2. The user clicked on a link leading to the customer login page (`/customer/login`, log_1757763963207). This could be considered as initiating the login task, which is necessary for continued navigation within the application.
3. After landing on the login page, the user scrolled down the page (log_1757763963313), but there's no further evidence of the user attempting to fill in their credentials or submitting the form.
4. The user then clicked a link leading back to the homepage (`/`, log_1757763963207). This action indicates that the user abandoned the login task without completing it, resulting in a drop-off.
