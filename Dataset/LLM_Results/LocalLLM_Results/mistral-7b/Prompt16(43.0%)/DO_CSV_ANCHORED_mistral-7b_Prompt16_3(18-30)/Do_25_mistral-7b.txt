1. User clicked on the "Restaurant Login" link (Session Initiation).
2. User entered a username ("User1").
3. User clicked on the username input field to focus it for typing (debounced_input event, indicating the user started typing but didn't finish immediately).
4. User clicked on the password input field to focus it for typing (debounced_input event, again suggesting that the user started typing but didn't complete it immediately).
5. User entered a password.
6. User clicked on the username input field to blur it, indicating they have finished entering the username ("blur" event).
7. User clicked on the password input field to blur it, indicating they have finished entering the password ("blur" event).
8. User clicked the login button (not shown in log), implying a successful login and completion of the task.

The user initiated all tasks and completed them successfully, so this session is classified as a conversion. The reason for this classification is that the user started and finished all the intended actions during the session without abandoning any of them.
