==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off

1. The user navigated to the login page (/customer/login) and triggered a scroll event, indicating that they scrolled down the page.
2. The user then clicked on an element with class "relative block w-full rounded-lg p-12 text-center hover:bg-gray-50 focus:outline-none focus:ring-2 focus:ring-orange-500 border-2 border-gray-300" (presumably a call-to-action button), but did not complete any subsequent tasks.
3. The user entered text "hi" into the username input field, triggering an input_change event and then triggered another input_change event with the same value (debounced_input event). However, no further interaction was observed in the log file.
4. The user clicked on a button element with class "w-full flex justify-center py-2 px-4 border border-transparent rounded-md shadow-sm text-sm font-medium text-white bg-orange-500 hover:bg-orange-600 focus:outline-none focus:ring-2 focus:ring-offset-2 focus:ring-orange-500" (presumably the "Sign In" button), but did not complete any subsequent tasks.
5. The user then scrolled up the page, triggering another scroll event.
6. The user left the page by navigating away from /customer/login.

The session was classified as a drop-off because the user initiated several tasks (scrolling, clicking on elements, and entering text), but did not complete any of them before leaving the page.
