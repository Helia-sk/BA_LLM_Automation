2. The user scrolled down on the homepage (log_1757765348622, log_1757765348732).
3. The user clicked on the "Hungry? Order delicious food from local restaurants" link on the homepage (log_1757765348622).
4. The user scrolled down on the /customer/login page (log_1757765349580, log_1757765348732).
5. The user clicked on the username input field on the /customer/login page (log_1757765349580).
6. The user scrolled down on the /customer/login page again (log_1757765349580).
7. The user did not input any value in the username field and did not click on the login button, indicating that the login process was abandoned (no corresponding logs found).

Reason: The session was dropped off because the user initiated a task (logging in) but did not complete it. The user showed interest by clicking on the "Hungry?" link and navigating to the /customer/login page, but ultimately decided not to proceed with logging in.
