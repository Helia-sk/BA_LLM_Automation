 Tag: Conversion

1. The user navigated to the restaurant dashboard page (/restaurant/dashboard) by clicking on the "Orders" link, indicating an initiation of a task or intent.

2. The user then clicked on the "Menu" link within the dashboard, suggesting further navigation to the menu page (/restaurant/dashboard/menu).

3. No subsequent logs indicate any further navigation or initiated tasks, but there are entries showing interactions with specific elements on the menu page, such as clicking on input fields and buttons. This suggests that the user was likely exploring and engaging with the content on the menu page.

4. The final log shows a form submission (form: /restaurant/place-order), indicating that the user completed the order placement process, which is a key conversion event for this session.

Since all initiated tasks were completed, the session can be classified as a Conversion. The user journey consisted of navigating to the restaurant dashboard page, clicking on the "Menu" link, and then completing the order placement process.
