 Tag: Drop-Off

1. The user (Anonymous) visited the restaurant login page at `/restaurant/login`.
2. The user clicked on the username input field (indicating they intended to enter their username).
3. The user entered "User1" into the username input field and moved on to the password input field without entering a password, indicating an intention to log in.
4. However, the user did not provide a password, which would have completed the login process, instead they clicked away from the page (`log_1757766696074_jfqgiuao5`) at `2025-09-13T12:31:36.074Z`.

The user initiated a login task but did not complete it, therefore the session was a drop-off. The user journey ended with the username input but not the password input.
