1. The user initiated the session by visiting the customer login page (log_1757763695638_oi0yeyisl).
2. The user clicked on the "Customer Login" button (log_1757763695638_oi0yeyisl), indicating an attempt to start the login process.
3. The user provided their username in the input field (log_1757763697593_pj1ybdrw2, log_1757763699210_kwlundlwi, log_1757763699767_qzhhw5h6h, and log_1757763699845_hd0w6i28h). However, the provided username length is 5 characters which is less than the required minimum for a valid login.
4. The user entered their password in the input field (log_1757763700920_fcl31v4ry and log_1757763707425_gdlpkgw6x), but there is no subsequent log indicating a successful login.
5. No log indicates that the user has completed any action after entering their password, such as clicking the submit button or navigating to another page, suggesting that they abandoned the session.

Reason: The user initiated the login process, but did not complete it, implying a drop-off.
