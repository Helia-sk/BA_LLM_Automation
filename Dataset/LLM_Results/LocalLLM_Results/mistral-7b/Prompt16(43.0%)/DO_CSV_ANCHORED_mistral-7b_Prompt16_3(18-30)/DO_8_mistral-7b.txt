 Tag: Drop-Off

1. The user navigated to the Customer Login page (log_1757764216697_ccq4sz3ab).
2. The user clicked on the "Customer Login" link, indicating an attempt to start the login process (log_1757764216697_ccq4sz3ab).
3. The user then clicked on the username input field, suggesting they intended to enter their username (log_1757764217892_qt9d87j07).
4. However, no further actions related to entering a username were recorded, indicating that the user did not proceed with entering their username or password, thereby abandoning the login process.
5. The user clicked on the username input field again (log_1757764219814_qt9d87j07), which could suggest an attempt to correct a mistake but no subsequent action was recorded, implying that the user abandoned the login process without completing it.

Reason: The session was dropped off because the user attempted to initiate the login process but did not complete it by entering their username or password.
