 Tag: Drop-Off

1. The user first clicked on the "Customer Login" link, indicating an initiation of a login task (Step 1).
2. The user then clicked on the username input field, which could be considered as providing their username for the login process (Step 2).
3. However, instead of entering their username, the user clicked away from the username input field without filling it in, suggesting an abandonment of the login task (Step 3). This is a drop-off since the initiated task was not completed.
4. The user did not proceed with any further steps, such as entering their password or clicking the submit button, so the session ended without a full completion of the login task.
