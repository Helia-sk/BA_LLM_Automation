1. The user initiated a session by clicking on the "History" link, indicating the start of their interaction with the application (log_1758986820537_d6ir4rjx3).
2. The user then clicked on the "Settings" link to navigate to a different page within the application (log_1758986823482_2vgj8ralk). This suggests that the user intended to perform some actions in the settings section.
3. However, after navigating to the settings page, there is no further activity logged for this session, indicating that the user abandoned their interaction with the application without completing any tasks on the "Settings" page.
4. Since one of the initiated tasks (interacting with the settings) was abandoned, the session is classified as a drop-off.
