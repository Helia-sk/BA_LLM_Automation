 Tag: Drop-Off

1. User initiated a login session by entering the restaurant's login page (log_1758985849134_sm9gb6j5r).
2. User submitted the login form with username and password details (log_1758985849132_sm9gb6j5r, log_1758985849032_pt9psc4kp).
3. Upon submission, the user's password was entered (log_1758985849032_pt9psc4kp), but it seems that the login attempt was unsuccessful as there is no further event indicating a successful login or navigation to another page.

The session was dropped off because the user initiated a task (login) but did not complete it, indicating an incomplete interaction with the application.
