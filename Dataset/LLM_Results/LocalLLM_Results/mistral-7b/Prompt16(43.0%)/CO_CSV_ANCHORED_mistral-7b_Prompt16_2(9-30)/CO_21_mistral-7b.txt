1. The user navigates to the homepage (`/`) of the website, initiating a new session (`log_1758984488691_bw420137b`). This is considered an initiated task as it marks the start of the user's interaction with the application.

2. The user clicks on the link to go to the login/registration page for restaurants (`log_1758984492967_wkl55uo2j`). This is also an initiated task as it indicates that the user intends to perform an action on the website.

3. The user clicks on the "Register your restaurant" button (`log_1758984493682_gt39cx9kn`) which navigates them to the registration form for restaurants. This is still an initiated task as it shows that the user has proceeded with the intended action.

4. The user fills out the registration form (`log_1758984492967_wkl55uo2j` and `log_1758984493682_gt39cx9kn`) with a username ("User1"). This is considered a completed task as the user has provided the necessary information to register their restaurant.

5. The user fills out the remaining fields of the registration form (not shown in the log file) and submits the form, successfully completing the registration process. This is another completed task as it marks the successful conclusion of the user's intended action on the website.

Since all initiated tasks have been completed, this session can be classified as a conversion. The user has successfully registered their restaurant on the website.
