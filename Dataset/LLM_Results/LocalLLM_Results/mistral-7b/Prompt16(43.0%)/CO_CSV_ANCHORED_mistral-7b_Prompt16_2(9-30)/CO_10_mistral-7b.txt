 Tag: Conversion

Here is the step-by-step user journey based on the provided log file:

1. The user started a new session by navigating to the customer dashboard (/customer/dashboard).
2. The user clicked on the "Orders" link, indicating they wanted to view their order history.
3. Upon reaching the orders page, the user clicked on an individual order to view its details.
4. The user then clicked on the "View Details" button for that specific order. This action indicated a desire to see more information about that particular order.
5. After viewing the order details, the user clicked on the "Balance" link to check their account balance.
6. The user did not perform any further actions in this session, indicating they found what they needed and completed their tasks.

The reason for classifying this as a conversion is that all initiated tasks were completed by the user, providing them with the desired information (order details and balance). Had the user clicked on an order but then abandoned it or navigated away from the site without clicking "View Details," it would have been classified as a drop-off.
