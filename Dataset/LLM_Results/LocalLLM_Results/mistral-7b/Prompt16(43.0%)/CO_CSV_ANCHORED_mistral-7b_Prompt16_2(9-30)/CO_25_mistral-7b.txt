 Tag: Drop-Off

The session was a drop-off because the user initiated an action (click on the menu link) but did not complete any other tasks that could be considered as a conversion (e.g., making a selection from the menu, adding items to a cart, or proceeding to checkout). The user simply scrolled and clicked on the menu without performing any further actions that would indicate a completed task.

1. [Step 1] The user initiated the session by accessing the restaurant's dashboard (/restaurant/dashboard/menu) through the frontend.
2. [Step 2] The user scrolled down the menu page (scroll event).
3. [Step 3] The user clicked on the "Menu" link (click event), but no subsequent events were recorded, indicating that the user did not proceed to make a selection or add items to the cart. This lack of further interaction suggests that the user abandoned the session without completing any tasks.
