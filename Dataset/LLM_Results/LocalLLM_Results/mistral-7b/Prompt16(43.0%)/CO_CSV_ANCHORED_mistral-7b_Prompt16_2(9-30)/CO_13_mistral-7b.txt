 Tag: Drop-Off

The session was a drop-off because while the user initiated the task of accessing the orders dashboard (/api/orders/) and clicking on an order ID (either /api/orders/21/complete or /api/orders/21/details), they did not complete any of those tasks. The user's actions suggest that they may have left the page or encountered an issue during the task, which resulted in the drop-off.

Here is the step-by-step user journey:

1. The user accessed the orders dashboard (/api/orders/) at 2025-09-14T09:45:51.
2. On the orders dashboard, the user clicked on an order ID to view or complete it, but the specific action and the corresponding timestamp are not provided in the log file for this session (either /api/orders/21/complete or /api/orders/21/details).
3. The user did not complete any further actions related to that order after clicking on its ID, which indicates that they may have left the page or encountered an issue during the task, leading to a drop-off.
