1. The user initiated a click on the "History" link (/restaurant/dashboard/history) at 2025-09-27T15:15:40.304Z, indicating they entered the history section of the dashboard.
2. The user clicked on a button labeled "View Details" (/restaurant/dashboard/history) in the history section at 2025-09-27T15:15:42.594Z, suggesting they wanted to view more details about one of the history items.
3. The user then clicked on a button labeled "X" (/restaurant/dashboard/history) at 2025-09-27T15:15:44.421Z, which is typically used to close or cancel an action. This indicates that the user decided not to view the details of the history item, and instead returned to the main history section.
4. The user did not perform any other tasks in the log file, suggesting they abandoned their session without completing any of the initiated tasks.

Therefore, this session was a drop-off because one of the initiated tasks (viewing the details of a history item) was abandoned by the user.
