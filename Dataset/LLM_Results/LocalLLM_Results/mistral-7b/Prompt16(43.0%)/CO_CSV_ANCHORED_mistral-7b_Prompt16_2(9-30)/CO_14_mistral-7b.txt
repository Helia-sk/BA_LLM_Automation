 Tag: Drop-Off

1. The user initiated the session by navigating to the "/customer/login" page (log_1758982001023_zzkgn108u).
2. The user clicked on the "Customer Login" link (log_1758982001023_gz1q16dwh), indicating an attempt to start the login process.
3. The user entered their username in the username input field (log_1758982001809_u5d0yu5q9).
4. The user clicked on the username input field, suggesting that they were about to enter their password (log_1758982001809_sinkyvxay). However, no log entry indicates that a password was entered, meaning the login process was not completed.

The session was abandoned after the user entered their username but did not complete the login process by entering their password and submitting the form. Therefore, it is classified as a Drop-Off.
