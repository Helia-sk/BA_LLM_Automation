 Tag: Drop-Off

1. The user navigated to the homepage of the website (log_1757773013317_qjhw9th5q).
2. The user scrolled down the page (log_1757773012670_mp8atqp66).
3. The user clicked on "Customer Login" button (log_1757773015075_4wi4zz4v7) which redirected the user to the customer login page.
4. After clicking the "Customer Login", no further actions related to the login process were recorded in the log file.

The session was a drop-off because the user initiated the task of logging into the customer area but did not complete it by entering any username or password. As all the initiated tasks are not completed, the session is classified as a drop-off.
