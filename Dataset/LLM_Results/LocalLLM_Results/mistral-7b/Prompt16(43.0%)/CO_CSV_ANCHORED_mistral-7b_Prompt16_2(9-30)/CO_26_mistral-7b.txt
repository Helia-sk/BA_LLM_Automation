 Tag: Conversion

1. The user (anonymous) navigates to the restaurant's dashboard menu page (/restaurant/dashboard/menu). This is an initiated task.

2. The user clicks on the "Add Item" button, which initiates the process of adding a new item to the menu.

3. The user selects an item category by clicking on "Starters", "Main Courses", "Desserts", "Drinks", or "Side Dishes". This is another initiated task.

4. The user does not abandon the session, instead, they initiate another task by clicking on "Salad" from the list of items under "Starters".

5. Since no further data shows the user abandoning the session or any other initiated tasks, we can infer that the user has successfully added an item to the menu, completing the "Add Item" task. Therefore, this is a conversion.
