 Tag: Drop-Off

1. The user navigated to the login page (/restaurant/login) by clicking on a link, indicating the start of a session.
2. The user inputted their username ("User1") and clicked on the username input field. This indicates that they have provided their username.
3. The user then clicked on the password input field but did not provide any password, which suggests that they might have decided to abandon the login process at this point.
4. The user clicked on the username-password form, suggesting that they were about to submit the form. However, no subsequent action was recorded for the password input field, implying that the user may have navigated away from the page or closed it without submitting the form.

Since the user did not complete the login process by providing their password and submitting the form, the session can be classified as a drop-off. The user journey was initiated but not completed due to the user's decision to abandon the login process.
