 Tag: Drop-Off

1. The user initiated a session by clicking on the "Restaurant Login" link (log_1757772897799_nqzze9f9t).
2. The user clicked on the username input field (log_1757772900702_79kr8ielg), indicating they intended to enter their username.
3. However, the user did not provide any input in the username field and instead clicked on the "Already have an account? Sign in" button (log_1757772899548_et1gujlcj), which led back to the login page without completing the task of logging in.
4. The user clicked on the "Already have an account? Sign in" link again (log_1757772897799_nqzze9f9t), suggesting they may have intended to create a new account instead but ultimately abandoned the session without completing any task.

This session was a drop-off because although the user initiated tasks, they did not complete any of them, and as a result, no conversion occurred. The reasons for the drop-off could be related to the complexity of the login process, lack of interest in creating an account or forgetting their account details.
