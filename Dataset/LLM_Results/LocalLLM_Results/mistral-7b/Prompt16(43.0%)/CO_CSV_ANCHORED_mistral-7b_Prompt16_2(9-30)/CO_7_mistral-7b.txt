 Tag: Drop-Off

1. The user initiated the session by navigating to the customer login page (log_1757773371689_3ak46jhcx).
2. The user clicked on the "Customer Login" button, indicating an attempt to start the login process (log_1757773372596_2oj0c59xu).
3. The user then clicked on the username input field to focus it for entering their credentials (log_1757773373072_scoku9tbi).
4. However, after clicking on the username input field, no further actions related to entering credentials or submitting the form were recorded in the log file. This suggests that the user may have abandoned the login process without completing it.

Since the user initiated the login process but did not complete it, this session can be classified as a drop-off. The user may have encountered an issue, got distracted, or decided not to proceed further. Further analysis or user feedback could provide more insights into why the user dropped off.
