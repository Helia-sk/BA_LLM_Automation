 Tag: Conversion

1. The user navigates to the Restaurant Login page (log_1757772852515_uvv507x14). This is the first step in the user journey.

2. The user clicks on the "Restaurant Login" link, initiating the login process (log_1757772853662_q9fok5nbl).

3. The user then clicks on the username input field to focus it, indicating that they want to enter their username (log_1757772852515_uvv507x14 and log_1757772853662_q9fok5nbl).

4. The user enters the username "User1" into the username input field (log_1757772857649_q9fok5nbl and log_1757772857649_46x4g9vrm).

5. The user clicks on the password input field to focus it, indicating that they want to enter their password (log_1757772857649_q9fok5nbl and log_1757772853662_lp2vv7jeb).

6. The user enters the password into the password input field, but the logs do not show any event indicating the submission of the form (log entries are missing for this step). However, since the user initiated the login process and provided both their username and password, it is reasonable to assume that they would have submitted the form if it were present.

7. Since the user has completed all initiated tasks (logging in), this session can be classified as a conversion. The user was able to successfully log into the restaurant's system.

Reason: The session was completed with the successful login, indicating that the user did not abandon any of the initiated tasks.
