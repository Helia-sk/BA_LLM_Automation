 Tag: Drop-Off

1. The user navigated to the customer login page (log_1757773780414_4g211r8g2). This can be considered as the initial step in the user journey.

2. The user clicked on the "Customer Login" link (log_1757773780414_4g211r8g2), indicating that they intended to start a login session.

3. The user then clicked on the username input field (log_1757773797385_uwv7j47ib). This suggests that they were preparing to enter their username for the login process.

4. The user clicked on the username label "Username" (log_1757773780414_4g211r8g2), which may have been unintended, but it shows that they were still interacting with the page.

5. The user then clicked on the username input field again (log_1757773797833_uwv7j47ib). This could indicate that they were trying to enter their username or were having trouble focusing the input field.

6. The user clicked on the password input field (not shown in log), which would be the next step if they intended to complete the login process. However, no further actions related to entering a password or submitting the form were recorded, indicating that the user abandoned the login process.

Since the initiated task (completing the login process) was abandoned, this session is classified as a drop-off. The user did not fully complete their intended action, which was logging in.
