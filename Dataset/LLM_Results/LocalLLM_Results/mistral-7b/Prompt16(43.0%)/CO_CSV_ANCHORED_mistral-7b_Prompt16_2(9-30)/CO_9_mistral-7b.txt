 Tag: Drop-Off

1. The user first clicked on the "Restaurants" link (log_1757773978615_5aiempet1) to navigate to the Restaurant page.
2. Upon reaching the Restaurant page, the user scrolled through the list of restaurants (log_1757773977591_7t5g3wcyi).
3. The user clicked on a restaurant with no image available (log_1757773978615_bwt5ki2v4), indicating they were likely interested in learning more about the selected restaurant. However, since there is no subsequent log entry showing that the user continued their interaction or completed any other tasks, it can be assumed that they abandoned the task (i.e., viewing the details of the selected restaurant).
4. The user then scrolled back to the main dashboard page (log_1757773978718_b7os385j5), which could indicate that they decided to go back and explore other restaurants or options, or simply navigate away from the application without completing any further tasks.
5. The user then scrolled through the main dashboard again (log_1757773978615_bwt5ki2v4), indicating they were either still exploring their options or had returned to the page after navigating away.
6. Lastly, the user left the application without performing any other actions.

Since one of the initiated tasks (viewing the details of a restaurant) was abandoned, this session is classified as a drop-off.
