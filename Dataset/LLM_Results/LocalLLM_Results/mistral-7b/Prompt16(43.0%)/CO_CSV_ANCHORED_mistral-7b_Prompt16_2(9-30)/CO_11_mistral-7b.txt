 Tag: Drop-Off

1. The user initiated a session by visiting the customer dashboard (`/customer/dashboard`) at timestamp `2025-09-13T14:37:56.450Z`.
2. The user scrolled down the page to position 310.3999938964844 (`log_1757774274528_gfo3b65es`) at timestamp `2025-09-13T14:37:54.528Z`.
3. The user clicked on an element with class "text-gray-400" (`log_1757774276450_fntdti8qo`) at timestamp `2025-09-13T14:37:56.450Z`, which is a link to navigate to the customer dashboard for a specific restaurant (`/customer/dashboard/restaurant/2`). However, this action was not followed by any subsequent interactions, suggesting that the user left the page or abandoned the session.

The reason for classifying this as a drop-off is that the user initiated an action to navigate to a specific restaurant's dashboard but did not complete it, indicating an abandonment of the task. The lack of further interactions suggests that the user did not find what they were looking for or decided not to proceed with the intended action.
