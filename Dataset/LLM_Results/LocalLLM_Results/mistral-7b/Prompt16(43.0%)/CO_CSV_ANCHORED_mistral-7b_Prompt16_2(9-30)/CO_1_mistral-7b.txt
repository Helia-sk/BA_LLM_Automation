 Tag: Drop-Off

1. The user navigated to the customer login page (log_1757772472157).
2. The user clicked on the "Customer Login" link, indicating an intent to log in (log_1757772472157).
3. The user then clicked on the username input field, which suggests a desire to enter their username (log_1757772473391).
4. However, the user did not proceed to enter any text into the username field or click the password input field, suggesting they may have abandoned the login process.
5. The user clicked on the username input field again (log_1757772473391), but still no text was entered and no further actions were recorded in the log file, indicating that the user did not complete the login process.

The session was a drop-off because the user initiated the login process but did not complete it by entering their username or password.
