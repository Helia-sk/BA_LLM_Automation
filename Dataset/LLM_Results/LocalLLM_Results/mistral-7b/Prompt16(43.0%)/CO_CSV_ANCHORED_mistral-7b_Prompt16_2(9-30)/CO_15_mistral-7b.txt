1. The user navigated to the page "/" (the homepage) at log_1758982282530_ew7a529gr, indicating the start of a new session.
2. The user clicked on the "Customer Login" link at log_1758982299417_vimywuxpt, which suggests an attempt to login.
3. The user then clicked on the username input field at log_1758982300242_lmwx4qaau and log_1758982302837_uugm0ut74, which indicates an attempt to enter a username. However, the log shows that the user only typed "U" before abandoning the input field.
4. The user clicked on the password input field at log_1758982300242_lmwx4qaau and log_1758982302837_uugm0ut74, but there's no subsequent action suggesting an attempt to enter a password.
5. The user clicked on the password input field again at log_1758982304466_zjp1q5xr5 and log_1758982304466_zjp1q5xr5, but there's no subsequent action suggesting an attempt to enter a password or submit the form.
