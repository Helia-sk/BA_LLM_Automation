 Tag: Drop-Off

1. The user visited the /customer/login page (log_1758983199627_hngsyu5zy).
2. The user clicked on the "Hungry? Order delicious food from local restaurants" link, which was not a part of the intended user journey for logging in (log_1758983199627_qfuoht04d).
3. The user then navigated to the form with the label "Username Password Sign In" (log_1758983199627_wsv6sd2o8), indicating the intention to login.
4. The user clicked on the form, but did not fill in any input fields or submit the form, indicating an abandonment of the login process (log_1758983200277_8oflhmi38).
5. Subsequently, the user clicked on another element within the form, possibly attempting to navigate away from the page or re-initiate the login process, but no further actions were taken that could be considered completing the intended task (log_1758983200633_lvosg5oui).
6. The user clicked on a different element within the form again, this time navigating away from the form and the login page entirely, confirming the abandonment of the login process (log_1758983200277_wsv6sd2o8).

The user initiated the intended task of logging in but did not complete it. The subsequent actions indicate that the user was either experiencing issues or had second thoughts, leading to an abandonment of the login process and a drop-off session.
