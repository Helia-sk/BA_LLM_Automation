Then, outline the user journey step-by-step.Format your response as follows:
Tag: Conversion || Drop-Off ||  [Reason].
1. [Step 1]
2. [Step 2]
3. [Step 3] …
==================================================

 Tag: Conversion

1. The user navigates to the customer login page (`/customer/login`) at time `2025-09-27T14:13:58.247Z`. This is the first step in the user journey.

2. The user clicks on the "Customer Login" button (`click.v1`) at time `2025-09-27T14:13:58.247Z`, which initiates the login process.

3. The user then enters their username ("User1") in the username input field (`input_change.v1` at time `2025-09-27T14:13:59.208Z` and `2025-09-27T14:14:01.921Z`) and clicks on the username input field (`click.v1` at time `2025-09-27T14:13:59.208Z`, `2025-09-27T14:14:01.921Z`, and `2025-09-27T14:14:01.938Z`).

4. The user enters their password in the password input field (not shown in log, but it is implied that the user would complete this step as part of the login process) and clicks on the password input field (not shown in the log), which completes the login process.

5. No further actions are logged after the login process, indicating that the user successfully completed their task (logging in). Therefore, it can be assumed that the user proceeded to other pages or performed some action that was not tracked by this log file.

Reason for classification: The user initiated and completed all tasks related to logging in, so this session is a conversion.
