1. The user navigated to the restaurant dashboard page (/restaurant/dashboard) by clicking on an "Orders" link.
2. From there, the user clicked on a "Menu" link to navigate to the menu page (/restaurant/dashboard/menu).
3. On the menu page, the user clicked on an input field for a food item.
4. The user then interacted with an input field for another food item.
5. However, no further interactions related to completing a task or submitting any form were found in the log file, which indicates that the user may have abandoned the session before completing their intended action (e.g., placing an order).
6. Lastly, the user clicked on a link outside of the current context (/restaurant/dashboard/menu), which suggests they left the page without submitting any form or completing a task.
