1. The user navigated to the restaurant login page (/restaurant/login).
2. The user clicked on the "Restaurant Login" button, indicating an attempt to log in.
3. The user then scrolled down the page, suggesting they were either looking for more information or searching for the appropriate input fields. However, no further interaction was recorded after this scroll event.
4. Subsequently, the user scrolled back up to the top of the page (/), which could indicate confusion or abandonment of the login attempt.
5. No subsequent events were recorded, suggesting that the user did not complete the login process or any other task on the site.

The session was classified as a drop-off because the user initiated a task (login) but did not fully complete it, indicating they abandoned the process at some point during their interaction with the site.
