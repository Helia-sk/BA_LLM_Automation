 Tag: Drop-Off

The session was a drop-off because the user initiated multiple tasks (click, input change) but did not complete any of them. The user clicked on the "Customer Login" button, which implies they intended to log in. However, they didn't fill out the username and password fields, which are necessary steps for login. Since these crucial steps were abandoned, the session can be classified as a drop-off.

1. [Step 1] The user navigated to the customer login page (/customer/login).
2. [Step 2] The user clicked on the username input field.
3. [Step 3] The user typed "dkjhf" into the username field and triggered a debounced_input event.
4. [Step 4] The user clicked outside the username field, which triggered a blur event and an input_change event with a final value length of 5 for the username.
5. [Step 5] The user clicked on the password input field.
6. [Step 6] The user did not enter anything in the password field, triggering a blur event and an input_change event with a final value length of 0 for the password.
7. [Step 7] The user clicked on the "Customer Login" button, which would normally initiate the login process if valid credentials were provided. However, since no valid username and password were entered, the session was abandoned (drop-off).
