 Tag: Drop-Off

1. The user navigated to the login page (`/restaurant/login`) by clicking on a link (log_1757767279593_nbcq8p6hm). This is the first step in the user journey.
2. The user clicked on the "Username" field (log_1757767283088_660zvvvma) to begin entering their username, indicating they intended to log in or register. This is the second step in the user journey.
3. The user clicked on the "Username" field again (log_1757767283588_yzalk2491), suggesting they might have been entering their username, but then stopped. This could be due to various reasons such as not recognizing the username or experiencing a momentary distraction. However, no further interactions related to username entry were recorded after this event, which indicates that the user may have abandoned the process (i.e., a drop-off occurred).
4. The user clicked on the "Username" field again (log_1757767283088_vb9bph7bm), but this time it was on the login form itself rather than the username field, suggesting they might have intended to enter their password next. However, no further interactions related to password entry or submission were recorded after this event, which further supports the assumption that the user may have abandoned the process (i.e., a drop-off occurred).
5. No subsequent events in the log file suggest any interaction with the login form or other parts of the application that would indicate the user completed the intended task (logging in or registering), thus confirming that this was a drop-off.
