2. The user clicks on the "Register your restaurant" button, indicating an intention to create a new account (log_1757766265457_otzii3aum).
3. The user then fills in the username input field with the value "User1" (log_1757766267707_js8xyblyk and log_1757766265457_ho5fyo7ke).
4. The user continues to interact with the application by clicking on the username field, suggesting they are attempting to fill in the required information (log_1757766265457_ho5fyo7ke).
5. Lastly, the user interacts with the password input field, indicating a further intention to complete the account registration process (not shown in the log, but the sequence of events suggests this step would follow).
