==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off

1. The user navigated to the login page (/customer/login) and initiated a session (session_1757763080934_tj3hw6dyl).
2. The user entered the username "hi" in the username input field and clicked on it, indicating an input change event (log_1757763869188_ics4wi63d).
3. The user clicked on the "Sign In" button but did not fill in the password, resulting in a click event without a corresponding input_change or submit event for the password field (log_1757763871708_sf7rfm74b). This indicates that the user abandoned the login process.
4. The user scrolled down the page but did not initiate any other tasks, suggesting they may have left the page (log_1757763863564_dn7d26z4i, log_1757763863458_g2igvoh26).

The user did not complete all initiated tasks (signing in), so the session was a drop-off. The user likely left the page due to not being able to proceed without filling out both the username and password fields.
