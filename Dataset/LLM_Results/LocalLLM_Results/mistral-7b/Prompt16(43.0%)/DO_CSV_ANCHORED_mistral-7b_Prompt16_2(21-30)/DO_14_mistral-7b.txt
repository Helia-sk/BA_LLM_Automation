 Tag: Drop-Off

1. The user initiated the task of navigating to the restaurant login page (log_1757765650904_aczosynfv).
2. The user clicked on the "Restaurant Login" button (log_1757765653033_182oq2yy5) to start the login process.
3. The user clicked on the username input field (log_1757765653032_k2omtefm6). This could be considered as entering their username for the login process.
4. The user entered "dd" in the username input field (log_1757765654366_eutf57smh and log_1757765654954_k38dcqefe). This step is part of the login process, but it's unclear if the user continued with the password input.
5. The user clicked on the username input field again (log_1757765654098_a8b72zjp), which might indicate that they were attempting to correct or edit their entry, but no further logs suggest they completed the login process.
6. The user clicked on the password input field (log_1757765654630_v5hq9xw2f). This is another step in the login process, but again, it's unclear if the user continued with entering their password or completed the process.

The session was a drop-off because the user initiated the login process but did not complete it. They stopped interacting after the username input field, and there are no logs suggesting they completed the login or any other tasks on the page.
