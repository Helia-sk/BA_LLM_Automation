 Tag: Conversion

1. The user visited the login page at `/restaurant/login` (log_1757765857968_90p4enc6u).
2. The user clicked on the username input field (log_1757765858753_hpphusaqe).
3. The user typed in a username, "User" initially, and then completed it as "User1" after two more events (log_1757765852442_o4msd7p91, log_1757765862443_7dbh12e0g).
4. The user clicked on the password input field (log_1757765862443_7dbh12e0g).
5. The user typed in a password, but no further events indicate that the user completed the login process or abandoned it, so we can assume that the login process was successfully completed as the user's actions suggest they are entering their credentials to log in (no log indicating a failed login attempt or a click on another link/button).

The reason for classifying this session as a conversion is that all initiated tasks were completed by the user, which includes entering both a username and password. The user's actions indicate they intended to log in and successfully did so.
