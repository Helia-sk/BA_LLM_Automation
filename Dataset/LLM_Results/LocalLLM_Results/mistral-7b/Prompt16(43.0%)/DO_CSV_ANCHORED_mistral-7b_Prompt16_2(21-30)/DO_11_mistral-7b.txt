4. The user then entered more characters in the username input field (log_1757765041735_vpxcy738k, log_1757765039999_giwhtlzzw), indicating they were continuing to type their username.
5. After entering the full username, the user clicked on the password input field (log_1757765042312_6u326rj73, log_1757765041735_vpxcy738k). This suggests they were preparing to enter their password.
