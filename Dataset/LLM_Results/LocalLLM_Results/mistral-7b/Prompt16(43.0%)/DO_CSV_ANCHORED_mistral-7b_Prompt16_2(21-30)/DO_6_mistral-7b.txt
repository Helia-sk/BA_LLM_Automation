 Tag: Drop-Off

1. The user initially scrolled down the home page (log_1757763960718).
2. The user navigated to the "/customer/login" page (log_1757763961523), which suggests the user might want to log in or sign up.
3. The user scrolled down the login/signup page (log_1757763963207, log_1757763963313).
4. The user clicked on a link to go back to the home page (log_1757763963207), but it seems they did not continue their session further, as there are no subsequent logs related to login/signup or any other initiated tasks.

The reason for tagging this session as a drop-off is that the user initiated a task (logging in or signing up) but did not complete it and subsequently abandoned the session without performing any other completed tasks.
