 Tag: Drop-Off

Explanation: The user initiated the session by navigating to the login page for the restaurant (log_1757766444047_g8wc8pd8q). They then clicked on the "Restaurant Login" button (log_1757766445475_g8wc8pd8q), indicating they intended to log in. However, after this action, there is no further evidence of any completed tasks related to logging in or interacting with the restaurant's website. The user did not enter any username or password (logs from 1757766446309_bwg76ugj7 to 1757766447943_t2x0kg879), suggesting they abandoned the login process. Since one of the initiated tasks was not completed, the session is classified as a drop-off.
