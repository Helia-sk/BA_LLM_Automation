4. The user clicks on the Lieferspatz logo at the top left corner of the page to go back to the homepage (log_1757765182697_ppqwm4iqk).

The session was dropped off because, although the user initiated a login process, they did not complete it by entering their credentials or clicking any further buttons. This indicates that the user had an intention to log in but eventually abandoned the process.
