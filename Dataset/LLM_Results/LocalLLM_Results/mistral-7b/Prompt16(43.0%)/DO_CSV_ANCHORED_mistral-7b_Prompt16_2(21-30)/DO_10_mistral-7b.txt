 Tag: Drop-Off

1. The user initiated a session by clicking on the "Customer Login" link.
2. The user then clicked on the username input field, which suggests they intended to enter their username.
3. However, the log does not show any further interaction with the username input field, suggesting that the user did not complete entering their username.
4. The user also did not interact with the password input field or the "Login" button, indicating that they did not complete the login process.

The user initiated a session by clicking on the "Customer Login" link but did not complete any of the subsequent tasks (entering their username or password and clicking the "Login" button), so this is classified as a drop-off.
