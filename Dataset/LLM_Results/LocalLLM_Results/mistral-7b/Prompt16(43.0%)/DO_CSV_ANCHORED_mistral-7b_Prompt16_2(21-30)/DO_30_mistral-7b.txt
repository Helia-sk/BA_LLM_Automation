 Tag: Drop-Off

1. The user navigated to the restaurant dashboard page (log_1758987296240_u3v4o05jt).
2. The user clicked on the "Menu" link (log_1758987296240_u3v4o05jt) to access the menu page.
3. The user initiated the task of adding an item to the menu by clicking on the "Add Item" button (log_1758987304130_lbnlmavu7).
4. The user filled out the form to add the item, but this action is not logged in the provided data.
5. The user did not complete the task by clicking on the "Save" or similar button, instead, they abandoned the form (log entries related to the form interaction are missing).
6. The user clicked on a different element within the same page, which could imply that they navigated away from the add item form or closed the browser tab/window (not explicitly logged in the provided data).

The session is classified as a drop-off because the user initiated the task of adding an item to the menu but did not complete it. The reason for this classification is that there are no log entries indicating that the user completed the form or saved the new item.
