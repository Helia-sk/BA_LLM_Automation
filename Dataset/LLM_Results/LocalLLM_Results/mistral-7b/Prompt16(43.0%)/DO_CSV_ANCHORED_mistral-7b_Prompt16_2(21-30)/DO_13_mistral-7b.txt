==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off

1. The user first scrolled down the page (log_1757765348622_2zfheh3u8) indicating that they have arrived at the /customer/login page, suggesting they may want to log in or create an account.
2. The user clicked on a link inviting them to order food (log_1757765347496_0wq2qrciq), which would suggest that they are interested in placing an order. However, the next logged event is a scroll event with no further interaction indicating that they may have scrolled down the page but did not proceed to initiate the order process.
3. The user then scrolled back up the page (log_1757765348732_eoh9n11qp), suggesting they may have decided to leave the page without taking any further action.
4. The next logged event is a click on another link within the /customer/login page (log_1757765349580_lqvyeozkn), but there is no subsequent activity, which indicates that they may have clicked this link out of curiosity but did not proceed further.
5. The user then made another scroll event (log_1757765348622_5664tgoz2) and clicked on the same link again (log_1757765349580_lqvyeozkn), suggesting they may have wanted to leave the page but then decided to stay for a brief moment longer, but there is no subsequent activity after this.
6. The final logged event is another scroll event with no further interaction (log_1757765348732_p1pw8xcbv), suggesting that the user has abandoned the page without taking any action.

Reason: The session was a drop-off because the initiated task (placing an order) was not completed and the user did not proceed with any other actions on the page.
