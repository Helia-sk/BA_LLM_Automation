 Tag: Drop-Off

1. The user (anonymous) initiated a session by clicking on the "History" link at /restaurant/dashboard, indicating they may have wanted to view their previous orders or transaction history.
2. The user then clicked on the "Settings" link at /restaurant/dashboard, which could indicate they were interested in modifying account settings or preferences.
3. From there, the user interacted with multiple elements on the settings page. They clicked on a drop-down menu associated with a select element for selecting days of the week, and also clicked on additional select elements (which may have been drop-down menus as well). However, it appears that the user did not make any selections in these elements and instead abandoned the session by leaving the page without completing any tasks.
4. The user then interacted with multiple input fields on the settings page, clicking on various text inputs (time inputs, date inputs, etc.). Again, it seems that the user did not provide any input or complete any tasks in these fields and instead abandoned the session.
5. The user also clicked on a button labeled "Save Changes" at some point during their interaction with the settings page, but they did not actually submit the form, indicating that they may have intended to make changes but ultimately decided against it and left the page without completing any tasks.

It is likely that the user abandoned the session without completing any tasks or making any changes, as they did not make any selections in the select elements or provide any input in the text inputs. Therefore, this session would be classified as a drop-off.
