If all initiated tasks are completed → Tag: Conversion. If even one fo the  initiated tasks are abandoned → Tag: Drop-Off. Provide a reason for your classification. Then, outline the user journey step-by-step.Format your response as follows:

 Tag: Drop-Off

The session was a drop-off because the user initiated multiple tasks (clicking on the login page, entering username, clicking to focus on the password field) but did not complete the final step (entering a password and clicking the Sign In button). The fact that the user only entered one character in the username field suggests they may have abandoned the process prematurely.

User Journey:
1. [Step 1] The user navigated to the restaurant login page (route /restaurant/login) at timestamp 2025-09-13T12:15:34.477Z.
2. [Step 2] The user clicked on the username input field (click event) at timestamp 2025-09-13T12:15:34.477Z.
3. [Step 3] The user entered a character 'd' in the username field (input_change event) at timestamp 2025-09-13T12:15:35.119Z.
4. [Step 4] The user clicked on the password input field (click event) at timestamp 2025-09-13T12:15:39.057Z, but did not enter any characters or click the Sign In button. This indicates that the user abandoned the process, hence tagged as a drop-off.
