==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: Not all initiated tasks were completed. The user initiated a form submit (login) but did not complete it, as indicated by the "form_submit" event and no subsequent "form_success" or similar event was recorded.

   1) [Step 1] User navigated to the restaurant's login page ("/restaurant/login").
   2) [Step 2] User entered their credentials into the form fields (indicated by the "input_change" events for both username and password).
   3) [Step 3] User clicked the "Sign In" button to submit the form, but no subsequent event suggests a successful login. Instead, another "click" event on the same page was recorded, indicating that the user may have navigated away or performed some other action without completing the login process.
   I have considered all the logs provided in the log file for this analysis.
