 Tag: Conversion

   Reason: The user initiated a task (clicking on "Settings") and completed it by performing subsequent actions such as clicking on the "Add" button, interacting with an input field, and finally submitting the form by clicking the "Submit" button. This indicates that the user completed all the intended tasks, hence classifying this session as a conversion.

   1) The user accessed the dashboard page (not shown in logs).
   2) The user clicked on the "Settings" link to navigate to the settings page.
   3) The user interacted with an input field by clicking on it.
   4) The user entered some data into the input field (not shown in logs).
   5) The user clicked the "Add" button, indicating they wanted to add something.
   6) The user clicked on another input field, possibly to enter more data or select an option.
   7) The user clicked the "Submit" button, submitting the form and completing their task.
