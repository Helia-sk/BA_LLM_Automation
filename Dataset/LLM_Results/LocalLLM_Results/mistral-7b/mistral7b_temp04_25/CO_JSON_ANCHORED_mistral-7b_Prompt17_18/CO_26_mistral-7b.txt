 Tag: Conversion

   Reason: The user initiated a task (clicking on "Add Item") and completed it by submitting the item. This indicates that the user intended to complete the task and followed through with it, which is indicative of a conversion.

   1) [Step 1] The user navigated to the restaurant's dashboard menu page.
   2) [Step 2] The user scrolled down the page to view the available menu items.
   3) [Step 3] The user clicked on the "Add Item" button.
   4) [Step 4] The user selected an item (either by dragging and dropping or clicking).
   5) [Step 5] The user confirmed the addition of the item by clicking on it again.
   Note: Although the user scrolled back to the top of the page, this can be considered as a natural navigation behavior rather than abandoning the task. Therefore, the user journey is complete and all logs have been considered.
