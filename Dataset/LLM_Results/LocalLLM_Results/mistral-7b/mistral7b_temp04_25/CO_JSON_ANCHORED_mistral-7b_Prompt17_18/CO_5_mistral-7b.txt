==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user clicked on the "Customer Login" button, but no subsequent logs indicate that he completed any task related to login or navigation to another page. Instead, there are multiple scroll events and a single click event which could suggest the user was navigating the site, but did not complete any of the initiated tasks.

  1) The user landed on the homepage (/).
  2) The user scrolled down the homepage.
  3) The user scrolled back to the top of the homepage.
  4) The user clicked on the "Customer Login" button.
  5) The user scrolled down the Customer Login page.
  6) The user scrolled up the Customer Login page.
  7) The user continued scrolling on the Customer Login page, but no further actions were recorded.

   All initiated tasks (login and navigation to another page) were not completed, hence the session was a drop-off.
