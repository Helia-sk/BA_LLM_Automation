==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off

   Reason: The user initiated a task (clicking on the "Customer Login" button) but did not complete it. They clicked on the username input field and password input field, but no further actions related to filling out the login form were recorded. This indicates that the user may have decided not to proceed with the login process.

   1) [Step 1] The user arrived at the customer login page by clicking on the "Customer Login" link from the homepage.
   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the username input field, indicating they intended to enter their username.
   3) [Step 3] The user clicked on the password input field, suggesting they intended to enter their password.
   4) No further actions related to filling out the login form or submitting it were recorded, indicating that the user may have decided not to proceed with the login process. This makes the session a drop-off.

   Note: It's important to consider all logs in the session before making a decision. In this case, even though the user interacted with the username and password fields, they did not complete the intended task (logging in), which is why we classify this as a drop-off.
