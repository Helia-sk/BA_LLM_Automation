==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: One of the initiated tasks (scrolling down the page and clicking on "Restaurant 4") was abandoned, as there are no subsequent logs indicating completion of any other task. The user did not proceed to initiate another task, such as filling out a form or making a purchase.

  1) [Step 1] User visited the customer dashboard page (http://localhost:5173/customer/dashboard/).
  2) [Step 2] User scrolled down the page and reached Restaurant 4, as indicated by the "scroll" event at position 4.
  3) [Step 3] User clicked on the image area of Restaurant 4 (http://localhost:5173/customer/dashboard/restaurant/4), but there are no subsequent logs indicating any further interaction with that page or any other page, suggesting that the user did not complete any task.
  4) [Step 4] User scrolled down the Restaurant 4 page and clicked on an empty area (http://localhost:5173/customer/dashboard/restaurant/4), which was likely an accidental click as there are no subsequent logs indicating any further interaction with that page or any other page, suggesting that the user did not complete any task.
  5) [Step 5] User scrolled down the customer dashboard page again (http://localhost:5173/customer/dashboard/), but there are no subsequent logs indicating any further interaction with that page or any other page, suggesting that the user did not complete any task.
  6) [Step 6] User closed the session without completing any tasks.

   All initiated tasks were not completed, so this session was a drop-off. The user journey ended without conversion.
