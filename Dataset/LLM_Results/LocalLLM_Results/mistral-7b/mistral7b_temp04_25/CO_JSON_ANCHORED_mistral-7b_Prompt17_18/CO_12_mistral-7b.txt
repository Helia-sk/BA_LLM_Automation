 Tag: Conversion

   Reason: The user initiated a task (clicking on the "Menu" link) and completed it by navigating to the "Menu" page. After that, the user interacted with multiple elements on the "Menu" page, such as clicking on an item ("Add Item"), filling out a form (input field for name and quantity), and submitting the form. This indicates that the user was engaged and completed all the initiated tasks, so this session can be classified as a conversion.

   1) [Step 1] The user landed on the homepage of the restaurant's dashboard.
   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "Menu" link to navigate to the menu page.
   3) [Step 3] On the menu page, the user scrolled through the available items and selected an item by clicking on the "Add Item" button.
   4) [Step 4] The user filled out the form with the desired name and quantity for the selected item.
   5) [Step 5] The user submitted the form to add the item to the cart.
   At the end, I have considered all the logs provided in the log file, as they show that the user completed all the initiated tasks, so this session can be classified as a conversion.
