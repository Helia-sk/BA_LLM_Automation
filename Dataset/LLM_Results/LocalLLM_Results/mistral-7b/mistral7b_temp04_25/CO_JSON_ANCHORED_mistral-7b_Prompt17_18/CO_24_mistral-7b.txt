 Tag: Drop-Off

   Reason: Although the user initially clicked on the "Menu" link (indicating an interest in interacting with the menu), they did not complete any of the subsequent tasks such as uploading an image, clicking on a form, or clicking on any input fields within the form. The user's interaction with the page seems to have stopped after clicking on the "Menu" link, which suggests that they might have left the site without completing their intended action.

   1) [Step 1] The user navigated to the restaurant dashboard menu page ("http://localhost:5173/restaurant/dashboard/menu").

   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "Menu" link located at x = 586, y = 124.

   3) [Step 3] The user did not interact with any other elements on the page, indicating they might have left the site without completing their intended action.

   Note: All logs were considered to make this decision. The user's interaction with the page suggests a drop-off since they did not complete any of the initiated tasks.
