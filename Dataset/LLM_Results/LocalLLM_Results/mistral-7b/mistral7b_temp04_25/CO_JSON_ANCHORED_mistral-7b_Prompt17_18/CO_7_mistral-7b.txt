 Tag: Drop-Off

   Reason: The user initiated the task of navigating to the Customer Login page, but did not complete the subsequent tasks such as entering a username and password. This indicates that the user abandoned the process before completing it.

   1) [Step 1] The user navigated to the homepage of the website.
   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "Customer Login" link located at the top right corner of the page.
   3) [Step 3] The user clicked on the username input field, indicating they intended to enter their username. However, no log shows the user actually typing or submitting a username.
   4) [Step 4] The user did not click on or interact with the password input field, suggesting that they did not intend to enter a password.
   5) [Step 5] The user did not click on the "Submit" button or any other element that would indicate a login attempt.
   6) [Step 6] The user's session ended without any further interaction with the website, indicating that they abandoned the process.

   I have considered all the logs provided in making this decision. There is no indication that the user completed any of the initiated tasks (entering a username and password), so the session was a drop-off.
