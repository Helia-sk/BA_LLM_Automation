==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: One of the initiated tasks (accepting an order in the backend) was abandoned, as indicated by the "http_request" event with a null status code. The frontend logs show clicks on the dashboard, but no subsequent action related to accepting the order.

   1) [Step 1] - User navigates to the restaurant dashboard (as indicated by the frontend click log).
   2) [Step 2] - User initiates an action to accept an order from the backend (as indicated by the "http_request" event for the "/api/orders/26/accept" route, with a null status code indicating the request was not completed).
   3) [Step 3] - User clicks on an SVG element in the frontend dashboard (as indicated by another frontend click log), but no subsequent action related to accepting the order is recorded.
   Note: The "OPTIONS" requests do not indicate initiated tasks as they are typically preflight requests made by the browser to check if a CORS-enabled request can be made. They do not contribute to the user journey for the purpose of this analysis.

All logs have been considered in the decision making process.
