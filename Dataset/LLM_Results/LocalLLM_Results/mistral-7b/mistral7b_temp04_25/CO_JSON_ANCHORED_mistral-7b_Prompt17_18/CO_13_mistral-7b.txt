==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: One of the initiated tasks (View Details) was abandoned, indicating that the user did not complete the intended action.

   1) [Step 1] The user accessed the restaurant dashboard (/restaurant/dashboard/history).
   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "History" link to navigate to the history page.
   3) [Step 3] The user clicked on the "View Details" button, but did not complete any further actions related to that particular item, suggesting that they left the page without completing the intended action (Viewing Details).
   4) [Step 4] The user clicked on the "X" button to close a certain element on the page. This could indicate that the user was trying to dismiss an error message or some other non-critical UI element, but it doesn't necessarily mean they left the site completely.
   5) [Step 5] The user clicked on the "History" link again, indicating that they may have wanted to go back to the history page for some reason. However, since we don't have further logs to confirm whether they completed any other actions on that page or not, we cannot definitively say if this was part of a conversion or drop-off event.
   It is important to note that while the user did initiate multiple tasks, they did not complete all of them, making it a drop-off session.
