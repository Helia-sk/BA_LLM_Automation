==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: Although the user initiated the task of navigating to the customer login page, they did not complete the subsequent tasks such as entering a username or password. Instead, they left the site by clicking on another link (pathname "/") after the initial navigation event.

1) [Step 1] User clicked on the "Customer Login" link from the restaurant dashboard settings page (log with attempt_id "log_1758982745841_zt9tbfo0t").
2) [Step 2] User navigated to the customer login page (log with attempt_id "log_1758982746939_7qttgtuwg").
3) [Step 3] User clicked on the username input field but did not enter any text (log with attempt_id "log_1758982745841_nn4i1w1qb").
4) [Step 4] User left the site by clicking on another link (log with attempt_id "log_1758982735683_nn4i1w1qb").

The user initiated a task but did not complete it, so this session can be classified as a drop-off. It is important to consider all the logs in the sequence to make an informed decision and understand the user journey accurately.
