==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user initiated a task (clicked on "History") but did not complete it by clicking on any of the subsequent elements related to that task. Instead, the user clicked on an element unrelated to the history task ("View Details"). This indicates that the user did not complete the intended action, which is a characteristic of a drop-off session.

  1) [Step 1] The user navigated to the restaurant dashboard page (http://localhost:5173/restaurant/dashboard).
  2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "History" link located at x=676, y=126.
  3) [Step 3] The user clicked on the "View Details" button located at x=1538, y=298, which was not part of the intended history task flow. This action suggests that the user did not complete the intended action (viewing the history details).
  4) [Step 4] The user clicked on the "Reject" button located at x=1538, y=298, but this action was also unrelated to the history task.
  5) [Step 5] The user clicked on the "X" icon (close button) located at x=1546, y=17, which closed the details panel. This action further indicates that the user did not complete the intended action related to the history task.
  6) [Step 6] The user clicked on the "History" link again, but this repetitive click does not change the fact that the user did not complete the intended action related to the history task.
  7) [Step 7] The user closed the page by clicking on the "X" icon (close button) located at x=1546, y=17. This action concludes the session.

   All initiated tasks were not completed, so the session was a drop-off. It is important to note that all logs were considered in this analysis.
