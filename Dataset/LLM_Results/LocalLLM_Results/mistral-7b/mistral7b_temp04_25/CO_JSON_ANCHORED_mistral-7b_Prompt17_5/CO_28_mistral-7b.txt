 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user initiated a form submission but did not complete it, as indicated by the "form_submit" event. However, the subsequent logs show that no further tasks were completed, such as the "click" events for the "Sign In" button or any input changes for the username field.

  1) [Step 1] The user visited the login page of a restaurant website (indicated by the first log with the route "/restaurant/login").
  2) [Step 2] The user entered their credentials into the username and password fields, but only the password field's value was logged (indicated by the "input_change" event for the password field).
  3) [Step 3] The user attempted to submit the form by clicking the "Sign In" button (indicated by the "form_submit" event), but this was not followed by any additional logs, suggesting that the user did not complete the submission process.

The user journey ends here as the user did not complete the intended task of signing in. It is important to note that all the provided logs were considered in making this decision.
