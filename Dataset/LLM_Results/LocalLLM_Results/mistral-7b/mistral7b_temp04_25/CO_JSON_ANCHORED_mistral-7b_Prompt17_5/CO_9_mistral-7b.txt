 Tag: Drop-Off

   Reason: The user initiated tasks (scrolling and clicking on elements), but did not complete any of them. The user clicked on the "Restaurant 4" card, scrolled down to view it, then scrolled back up and clicked on the image placeholder for Restaurant 4. However, they did not click on any other links or buttons that would indicate a completion of a task. They also left the page without performing any actions that could be considered a conversion (e.g., placing an order, booking a table, etc.).

   1) [Step 1] The user accessed the customer dashboard page.
   2) [Step 2] The user scrolled down to view Restaurant 4.
   3) [Step 3] The user clicked on the image placeholder for Restaurant 4.
