 Tag: Conversion

   Reason: All initiated tasks in the session were completed. The user first clicked on the "Restaurants" link from the dashboard, then scrolled down to view a restaurant, clicked on the image (which could be intended to navigate to more details about the restaurant), scrolled back up to the top of the page, and finally clicked on the "No image available" placeholder, which might have been intended to upload an image for the restaurant. Since all these actions seem to be part of the intended user journey and were completed by the user, this session can be classified as a conversion.

   1) The user started at the dashboard (/customer/dashboard).
   2) Clicked on the "Restaurants" link from the dashboard.
   3) Scrolled down to view a specific restaurant.
   4) Clicked on the image of the restaurant (intended to navigate to more details, but it seems like there was no image available).
   5) Scrolled back up to the top of the page.
   6) Clicked on the "No image available" placeholder, which could have been intended to upload an image for the restaurant.

   All logs were considered in this analysis.
