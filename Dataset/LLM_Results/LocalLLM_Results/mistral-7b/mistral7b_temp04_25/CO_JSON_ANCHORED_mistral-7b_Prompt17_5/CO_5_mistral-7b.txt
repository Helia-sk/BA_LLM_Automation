==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user clicked on the "Customer Login" link, which indicates that they initiated a task (logging in). However, after this action, there is no further evidence of any other tasks being completed. This suggests that the user may have abandoned the site after logging in, as no other actions such as scrolling or interaction with form fields were observed.

  1) [Step 1] The user accessed the homepage at "http://localhost:5173/". They scrolled down the page to a certain point.
  2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "Customer Login" link located at x = 598, y = 37. This action indicated that they intended to log in.
  3) [Step 3] After clicking the "Customer Login" link, there is no further evidence of any other tasks being initiated or completed. The user did not scroll, interact with form fields, or perform any other actions suggesting that they may have abandoned the site after logging in.

   It's important to note that all logs were considered in this analysis. The absence of additional actions after clicking the "Customer Login" link is what led to classifying this session as a drop-off.
