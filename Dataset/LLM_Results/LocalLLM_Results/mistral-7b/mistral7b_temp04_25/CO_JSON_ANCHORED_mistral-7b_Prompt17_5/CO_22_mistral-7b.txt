==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user initiated a task (clicking on the "Restaurant PartnersRegister your restaurant or log in to manage orders") but did not complete it by logging in or registering. Instead, they navigated away from the login page.

1) [Step 1] The user visited the Restaurant Partners website ("http://localhost:5173/restaurant/login").
2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the link "Restaurant PartnersRegister your restaurant or log in to manage orders" but did not proceed with logging in or registering.
3) [Step 3] The user navigated away from the login page by clicking on an external link ("http://localhost:5173/restaurant/login"). This indicates that they did not complete the intended task, which was to log in or register.
4) [Step 4] The user visited another page (not shown in the provided logs), indicating they navigated away from the login page without completing their intended task.

The decision is based on the observation that the user initiated a task but did not complete it, which indicates a drop-off. All the logs were considered to reach this conclusion.
