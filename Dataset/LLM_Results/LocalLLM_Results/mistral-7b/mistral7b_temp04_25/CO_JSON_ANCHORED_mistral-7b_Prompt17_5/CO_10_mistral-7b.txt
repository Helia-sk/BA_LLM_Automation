==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user initiated tasks by clicking on "Balance", then "Orders", but did not complete any of those tasks. Instead, they clicked on "View Details" under Orders, but further logs show that they clicked on the "X" button to close the details view, and eventually closed the session by clicking on "Orders" again, which indicates that they did not find what they were looking for or decided not to proceed with their actions.

  1) The user started the session by accessing the customer dashboard (not shown in logs).
  2) Clicked on the "Balance" link to check their balance.
  3) Clicked on the "Orders" link to view their orders.
  4) Opened the details view for one of their orders by clicking on "View Details".
  5) Closed the details view by clicking on the "X" button.
  6) Closed the session by clicking on "Orders" again.

   All initiated tasks were not completed, so the session was a drop-off. The user did not find what they were looking for or decided not to proceed with their actions.
