 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user initiated a task by clicking on the "Menu" link, but did not complete any other tasks that were recorded in the logs. The user scrolled down the page and then stopped interacting with the application. Since one of the initiated tasks was abandoned, the session is classified as a drop-off.

   User Journey:
   1) [Step 1] The user visited the restaurant dashboard page (http://localhost:5173/restaurant/dashboard/menu).
   2) [Step 2] The user scrolled down the page to position y=81.
   3) [Step 3] The user clicked on the "Menu" link at position x=571, y=125.
   4) [Step 4] The user scrolled further down the page to position y=588 and clicked on an SVG element, but no other tasks were completed after this interaction.
   Since the user did not complete any other tasks after clicking on the "Menu" link, the session is classified as a drop-off.
