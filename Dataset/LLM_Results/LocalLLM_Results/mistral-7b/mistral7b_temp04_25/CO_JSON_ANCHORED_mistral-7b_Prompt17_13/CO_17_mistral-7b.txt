 Tag: Conversion

   Reason: The user initiated two tasks (visiting the Restaurants page and selecting a restaurant) and completed both of them by clicking on the "Restaurants" link and then clicking on the "Add to Cart" button. Since all initiated tasks were completed, the session can be classified as a conversion.

   1) [Step 1] The user landed on the customer dashboard page.
   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "Restaurants" link to navigate to the Restaurants page.
   3) [Step 3] The user scrolled down and found a restaurant they liked, then clicked on it to view more details.
   4) [Step 4] The user scrolled up to find the "Add to Cart" button and clicked on it to add the selected restaurant to their cart.
   5) [Step 5] The user may have continued browsing or decided to proceed to checkout, but since the logs end here, we cannot be certain about the next steps. However, since all initiated tasks were completed, the session can still be classified as a conversion.
