==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user initiated a task (clicking on the "Customer Login" button) but did not complete it. Instead, they navigated away from the page without providing any further interaction that could be considered as a completed task.

   1) [Step 1] The user was on the restaurant dashboard settings page with session ID: session_1758982735683_6tqp38avs.
   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "Customer Login" link, which took them to the customer login page with session ID still the same.
   3) [Step 3] The user did not interact further with any of the elements on the customer login page, such as filling in the username or password fields and clicking submit. Instead, they navigated away from the page, possibly due to a change of mind or an interruption.
   4) [Step 4] The user navigated back to the homepage (/), still with the same session ID, without any further interaction on the customer login page. This indicates that the initiated task was not completed, and thus, the session can be classified as a drop-off.
   I have considered all the logs provided in the log file for my decision making.
