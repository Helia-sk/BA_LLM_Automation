==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user initiated a task (clicking on "Menu") but did not complete any other tasks that could be considered as part of a conversion, such as uploading an image, filling out a form, or saving changes.

   Step 1) User navigated to the restaurant dashboard page ("http://localhost:5173/restaurant/dashboard/menu").
   Step 2) User clicked on the "Menu" link at x=586, y=124.
   Step 3) User clicked on an SVG element at x=664, y=338, but this does not appear to be part of a conversion task.
   Step 4) User clicked on the "Form" element at x=889, y=695, which could potentially be a conversion task, but no further interaction with that form was recorded.
   Step 5) User clicked on various elements within the form (image drag area, cancel, save changes buttons), but did not complete any of these actions.
   Step 6) The session ended without any completion of initiated tasks.

   All logged events were considered in this analysis. The user did not complete any tasks that could be considered as part of a conversion, so the session was classified as a drop-off.
