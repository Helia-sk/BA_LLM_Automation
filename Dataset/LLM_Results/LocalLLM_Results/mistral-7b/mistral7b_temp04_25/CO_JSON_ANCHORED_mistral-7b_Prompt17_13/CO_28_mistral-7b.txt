 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user initiated a form submit event (log 5), but did not complete it, as indicated by the subsequent input change event (log 6) which was followed by no further form submission. This suggests that the user abandoned the form before completing it.

   User Journey Step-by-step:
   1) [Step 1] The user visited the login page of the restaurant website (log 9).
   2) [Step 2] The user entered their username or email address (not specified in the logs).
   3) [Step 3] The user entered their password (not specified in the logs), but the password field was blurred, suggesting that the user may have finished typing. However, this was not followed by a form submit event, indicating that the user did not click the 'Sign In' button.
   4) [Step 4] The user changed the value of the password input field (log 6), but this was also not followed by a form submit event, suggesting that the user may have decided to change their password again or abandon the form altogether.
   5) [Step 5] The user did not take any further actions on the login page, indicating that they abandoned the form and did not complete the login process.

   I have considered all the logs provided in the log file for my decision making.
