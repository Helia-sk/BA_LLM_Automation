 Tag: Conversion

   Reason: The user initiated the task of signing in by clicking on the "UsernamePasswordSign In" button, then proceeded to click on the username and password input fields. This indicates that they intended to enter their credentials, which is a necessary step for signing in. After entering their credentials, they clicked the submit button, indicating completion of the sign-in process. Therefore, since all initiated tasks were completed, this session can be classified as a conversion.

   1) The user landed on the homepage (URL: http://localhost:5173/customer/login).
   2) The user clicked on the "UsernamePasswordSign In" button to initiate the sign-in process.
   3) The user clicked on the username input field and then entered their username.
   4) The user clicked on the password input field and then entered their password.
   5) The user clicked the submit button, indicating completion of the sign-in process.
   Note: Although the user also clicked on a link for ordering food, this action did not interfere with or prevent the completion of the sign-in process, so it is not considered part of the user journey for this analysis.
