==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user initiated the task of clicking on the "Customer Login" link, but did not complete the subsequent tasks such as entering a username and password. Instead, they navigated away from the login form by clicking elsewhere on the page. Since all initiated tasks were not completed, this session is classified as a drop-off.

   User Journey:
   1) [Step 1] The user visited the homepage of the website (not shown in logs).
   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "Customer Login" link located at the top right corner of the page.
   3) [Step 3] The user navigated to the login form page.
   4) [Step 4] The user clicked on the username input field, but did not enter any data (indicating they intended to enter a username).
   5) [Step 5] The user clicked elsewhere on the page instead of the password input field, suggesting they may have abandoned the login process.
   Note: It is possible that the user intended to return to the login form later or navigate away temporarily, but since we do not have further logs to confirm this, the session is classified as a drop-off.
