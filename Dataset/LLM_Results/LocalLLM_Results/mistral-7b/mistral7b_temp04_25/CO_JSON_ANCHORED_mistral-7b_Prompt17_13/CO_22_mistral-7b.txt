==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user initiated a task (clicking on the "Restaurant Partners" link to register or log in) but did not complete it, instead moving on to another task (entering a username and clicking the username input field). However, the user abandoned this task by not entering any information and then clicked away from the field. The user did not complete the final task of submitting the login form, so the session was a drop-off.

   Here is the user journey step-by-step:
   1) [Step 1] The user navigated to the restaurant login page.
   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "Restaurant Partners" link, indicating an intent to register or log in.
   3) [Step 3] The user returned to the username input field and entered the text "User1".
   4) [Step 4] The user did not click the submit button, instead clicking away from the username input field, which indicates abandonment of this task.
   The user did not complete any other tasks in the log file, so the session was a drop-off.
