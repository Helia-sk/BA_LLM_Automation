 Tag: Conversion

   Reason: All the initiated tasks in this session were completed. The user clicked on the "History" link, then clicked on "View Details", and finally clicked on the "X" button to close a popup. After that, the user clicked on another "X" button and then clicked on "View Details" again, which indicates that the user was interacting with multiple details of the history.

   1) The user initiated a session by accessing the restaurant dashboard (implied from the URL).
   2) The user clicked on the "History" link to view the history.
   3) The user clicked on "View Details" for one of the history entries.
   4) The user closed a popup by clicking on the "X" button.
   5) The user clicked on another "X" button (possibly closing another popup or re-closing the previous one).
   6) The user clicked on "View Details" again for the same history entry, suggesting that the user was interested in more details.
   Considering all the logs to the end, it can be seen that the user completed all the initiated tasks, so this session was a conversion.
