 Tag: Conversion

   Reason: The user initiated a task (clicking on "Add Item") and subsequently completed it by clicking on the specific item they wanted to add. This indicates that they have successfully completed at least one of the intended actions on the website, which suggests a conversion.

   1) [Step 1] The user accessed the restaurant's dashboard menu page (/restaurant/dashboard/menu).
   2) [Step 2] The user scrolled through the various menu items and clicked on the "Add Item" button.
   3) [Step 3] The user selected a specific item to add by clicking on it.
   4) [Step 4] The user was presented with an option to upload an image for the item, but they did not interact with this element (indicating that they may have decided to skip this step or it wasn't necessary for their current action).
   5) [Step 5] The user confirmed their selection by clicking on another part of the page, which implies that they have successfully added an item to the menu.
