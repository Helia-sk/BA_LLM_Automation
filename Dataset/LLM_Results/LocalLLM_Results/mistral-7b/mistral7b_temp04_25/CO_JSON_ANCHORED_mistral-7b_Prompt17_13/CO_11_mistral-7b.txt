 Tag: Conversion

   Reason: The user initiated a task (navigating to the dashboard page) and completed it by scrolling through the entire page, indicating engagement. Later, the user navigated to the customer dashboard page and again scrolled through the entire page, which suggests they were actively exploring the features of this page as well. No evidence was found in the logs that any initiated tasks were abandoned.

   1) The user initiated a session by accessing the application (not shown in logs).
   2) The user navigated to the customer dashboard page (log: "event_time": "2025-09-13T14:37:56.450Z", "url": "http://localhost:5173/customer/dashboard").
   3) The user scrolled through the customer dashboard page (log: "event_time": "2025-09-13T14:37:56.450Z", "event_name": "scroll", "scrollY": 0, "trigger": "scroll").
   4) The user navigated to another page (not shown in logs).
   5) The user returned to the customer dashboard page (log: "event_time": "2025-09-13T14:37:55.386Z", "url": "http://localhost:5173/customer/dashboard").
   6) The user scrolled through the customer dashboard page again (log: "event_time": "2025-09-13T14:37:55.386Z", "event_name": "scroll", "scrollY": 1348.800048828125, "trigger": "scroll").
   7) The user scrolled through the customer dashboard page a third time (log: "event_time": "2025-09-13T14:37:54.528Z", "event_name": "scroll", "scrollY": 310.3999938964844, "trigger": "scroll").
   8) The user initiated another task (not shown in logs).
   It is important to note that all the initiated tasks were completed, and no evidence was found of any abandoned tasks. Therefore, this session can be classified as a conversion.
