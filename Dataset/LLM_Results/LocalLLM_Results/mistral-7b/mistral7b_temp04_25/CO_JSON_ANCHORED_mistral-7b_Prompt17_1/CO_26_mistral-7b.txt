 Tag: Conversion

   Reason: The user initiated a task (clicking the "Add Item" button) and completed it, which indicates that they have added an item to their menu. Since no other tasks were abandoned, we can classify this session as a conversion.

   1) [Step 1] The user landed on the restaurant's dashboard page (http://localhost:5173/restaurant/dashboard/menu).
   2) [Step 2] The user scrolled through the menu items and clicked on the "Add Item" button.
   3) [Step 3] The user selected an item to add by clicking on it (this action is not explicitly shown in the log, but we can infer that since the "Add Item" button was clicked, an item must have been added).
   4) [Step 4] No further interactions were recorded, suggesting that the user may have completed their task and left the page or moved to another part of the application. However, since no more logs were provided, we cannot confirm this with certainty.

   All the initiated tasks (scrolling through the menu items and adding an item) were completed in this session, so it can be classified as a conversion.
