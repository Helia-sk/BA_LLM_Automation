 Tag: Conversion
   Reason: All initiated tasks in this session were completed. The user first scrolled down the page (Step 1), then clicked on the "Restaurant" link to view a specific restaurant's details (Step 2). After that, the user scrolled down within the restaurant's details page (Step 3) and finally clicked an element within that page, which could be an image or some other interactive content (Step 4). Since there are no logs indicating any task was abandoned, it can be concluded that this session resulted in a conversion.

   Here is the user journey step-by-step:
   1) The user visited the dashboard page (/customer/dashboard).
   2) The user clicked on the "Restaurant" link to navigate to a specific restaurant's details page (/customer/dashboard/restaurant/4).
   3) Upon reaching the restaurant's details page, the user scrolled down within that page.
   4) The user interacted with an element on the restaurant's details page by clicking it, which could be an image or some other interactive content.
