 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user clicked on the "Customer Login" link, but did not complete any of the subsequent tasks such as entering a username or password and submitting the form. This indicates that the user may have abandoned the session before completing the intended action.

1) [Step 1] The user navigated to the homepage (URL: http://localhost:5173/).
2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "Customer Login" link located at x = 633, y = 35.
3) [Step 3] The user was redirected to the login page (URL: http://localhost:5173/customer/login).
4) [Step 4] The user clicked on the username input field (x = 451, y = 310). This action implies that the user intended to enter their username.
5) [Step 5] The user clicked outside of the username input field (x = 433, y = 320), which could have been an accident or intentional abandonment of the task.
6) [Step 6] The user did not enter a password or submit the form, indicating that they did not complete the login process.

Considering all the logs provided, it appears that the user initiated the login process but did not complete it. Therefore, the session can be classified as a drop-off.
