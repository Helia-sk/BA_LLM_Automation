==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user initiated a task (clicked on "Customer Login") but did not complete it. Instead, they navigated away from the page without performing any other actions that would indicate a successful login or further interaction with the application.

   1) [Step 1] The user navigated to the restaurant dashboard settings page at http://localhost:5173/restaurant/dashboard/settings.
   2) [Step 2] The user then clicked on the "Customer Login" link located at x = 1659, y = 19.
   3) [Step 3] Instead of entering their credentials and clicking submit, the user navigated away from the customer login page by clicking somewhere else on the site or closing the browser tab/window, as indicated by the subsequent page view event at http://localhost:5173/. This action indicates that the user did not complete the intended task (logging in) and thus, the session can be classified as a drop-off.
   Note: It is important to consider all logs before making a decision. In this case, the user's subsequent actions did not involve any tasks related to the customer login page, which supports the conclusion that the session was a drop-off.
