 Tag: Drop-Off

   Reason: The user initiated a task (navigating to the dashboard page) but did not complete it. Instead, they scrolled through the page and then left the site without performing any other actions that could be considered as completing a task.

   1) [Step 1] User started a new session by opening the website on their browser (not shown in logs).
   2) [Step 2] User navigated to the customer dashboard page.
   3) [Step 3] User scrolled through the dashboard page, reaching the middle part of the page.
   4) [Step 4] User continued scrolling down but did not interact with any other elements on the page.
   5) [Step 5] User left the site without performing any actions that could be considered as completing a task or initiating another task (not shown in logs).

   In this log file, the user initiated a task by navigating to the customer dashboard but did not complete it, which indicates a drop-off. It's important to note that the logs do not show any actions taken after the user scrolled down the dashboard page, so we cannot definitively say whether they left the site or if they were still interacting with other parts of the website. However, based on the provided logs, it appears that the user did not complete any initiated tasks, which classifies this session as a drop-off.
