==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user initiated a task (clicking on the "Menu" link) but did not complete any of the subsequent tasks related to uploading an image, filling out the form for a menu item, or interacting with other elements that suggest completion of a task.

   1) [Step 1] User navigated to the restaurant dashboard page ("http://localhost:5173/restaurant/dashboard/menu").
   2) [Step 2] User clicked on the "Menu" link ("Menu", x: 586, y: 124).
   3) [Step 3] User interacted with the SVG element (x: 664, y: 338), but this does not seem to be a part of the form submission process.
   4) [Step 4] User clicked on the "FORM" element, possibly indicating an attempt to fill out the menu item form. However, no subsequent logs suggest that the user completed filling out the form or uploaded an image.
   5) [Step 5] User interacted with various input fields related to menu items (Starters, Main Courses, Desserts, Drinks, Side Dishes), but did not click on the "Save Changes" or "Cancel" buttons, suggesting that these interactions were not part of a completed task.
   6) [Step 6] User clicked on an input field within an SVG element (x: 664, y: 338), but this does not seem to be a part of the form submission process or any other completed tasks.

The user did not complete any of the initiated tasks, so the session was classified as a drop-off. All logs were considered in the decision making process.
