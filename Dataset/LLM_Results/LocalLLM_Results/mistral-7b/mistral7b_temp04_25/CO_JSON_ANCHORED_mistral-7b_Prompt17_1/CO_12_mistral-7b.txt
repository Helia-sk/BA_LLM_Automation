==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: One of the initiated tasks was abandoned. The user clicked on the "Menu" link, then clicked on the "Add Item" button, but there is no subsequent log showing that an item was successfully added to the menu. Instead, the next logs show the user clicking on a different element (the input field for adding an item), which suggests that they may have had an issue with the previous step and decided to try again, but the session ended without any further interaction related to completing the task of adding an item to the menu.

  1) The user clicked on the "Menu" link, indicating they navigated to the menu page.
  2) The user clicked on the "Add Item" button, suggesting they intended to add a new item to the menu.
  3) The user interacted with the input field for adding an item, but no subsequent logs show a successful addition of the item to the menu or any other action related to completing the task. This suggests that the user may have encountered an issue and decided not to continue with the task, leading to a drop-off.
  4) The session ended without any further interaction related to adding an item to the menu.
