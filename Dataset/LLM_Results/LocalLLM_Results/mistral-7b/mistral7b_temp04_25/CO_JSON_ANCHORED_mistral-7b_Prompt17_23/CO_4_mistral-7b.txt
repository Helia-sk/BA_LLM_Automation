 Tag: Conversion

   Reason: The user initiated a task (clicking on the "Restaurant Login" link) and completed it by entering their username, clicking the username input field, and then clicking the "Already have an account? Sign in" button. Although there was a click event on the "Sign up" link, it did not interrupt the user's primary task (logging in).

   1) [Step 1] The user navigated to the Restaurant Login page by clicking the "Restaurant Login" link.
   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the username input field to focus and prepare to enter their login credentials.
   3) [Step 3] The user entered their username in the username input field.
   4) [Step 4] The user clicked the "Already have an account? Sign in" button to submit their login details.
   5) [Step 5] (Implied, not logged) The system processed the user's login request and either successfully authenticated the user or displayed an error message.

   I have considered all the logs in my decision making process.
