==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user initiated a task (scrolling down the page) but did not complete it. After scrolling to different parts of the page, the user never interacted with any other elements that could be considered as a conversion event such as clicking on a button or link.

   1) [Step 1] The user visited the customer dashboard page (/customer/dashboard).
   2) [Step 2] The user scrolled down the page to position 0, then 310.3999938964844, and finally 1348.800048828125.
   3) [Step 3] The user did not interact with any other elements on the page, indicating that they may have left the site without completing a conversion event.
   Note: It is important to consider all logs before making a decision. In this case, even though the user scrolled down the page multiple times, they did not initiate or complete any other tasks that would be considered as a conversion event. Therefore, the session was classified as a drop-off.
