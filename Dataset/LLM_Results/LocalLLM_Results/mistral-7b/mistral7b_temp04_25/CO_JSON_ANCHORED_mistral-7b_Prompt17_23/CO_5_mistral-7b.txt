==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user clicked on the "Customer Login" button but did not complete any other initiated tasks, such as filling out the login form or navigating to another page. This indicates that the user may have abandoned the session after initiating the login process.

   User Journey:
   1) [Step 1] The user visited the homepage (http://localhost:5173/).
   2) [Step 2] The user scrolled through the page to view its content.
   3) [Step 3] The user clicked on the "Customer Login" button, initiating a login session.
   4) [Step 4] The user did not complete any other tasks related to the login process, such as filling out the form or navigating to another page.
   Note: Although the user scrolled again after clicking the "Customer Login" button, this action does not necessarily indicate a continuation of the login session since it could have been unintentional or exploratory in nature. The user's lack of interaction with the login form or navigation to other pages suggests that they may have abandoned the session.
   Check: All the logs were considered for the decision making process.
