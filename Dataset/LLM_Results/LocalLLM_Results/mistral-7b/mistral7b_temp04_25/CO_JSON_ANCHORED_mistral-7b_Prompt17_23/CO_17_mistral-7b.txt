 Tag: Conversion

   Reason: The user initiated a task (clicking on "Restaurants") and completed it by clicking on a specific restaurant ("No image available"). After that, the user clicked on another task ("Ratings & Reviews"), which indicates interaction with the intended functionality of the site. Although the user did not complete the "Ratings & Reviews" task, the initial task was completed, so the session can be considered a conversion.

   1) The user landed on the customer dashboard.
   2) The user clicked on the "Restaurants" link.
   3) The user scrolled down the page to view restaurant listings.
   4) The user clicked on a specific restaurant ("No image available").
   5) The user initiated the task of providing ratings and reviews but did not complete it.

   All the logs were considered in the decision-making process.
