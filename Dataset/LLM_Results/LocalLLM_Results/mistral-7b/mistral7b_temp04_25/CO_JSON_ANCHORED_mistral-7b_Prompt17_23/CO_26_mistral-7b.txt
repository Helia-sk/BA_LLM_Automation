==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off

   Reason: The user initiated a task (clicking on "Add Item") but did not complete it, indicating that they left the session without completing the intended action. This is evident from the logs where we see the click event for the "Add Item" button, but there are no subsequent events related to adding an item or any other completed tasks.

   1) [Step 1] The user visited the menu page (http://localhost:5173/restaurant/dashboard/menu).
   2) [Step 2] The user scrolled through the menu items and clicked on "Add Item".
   3) [Step 3] The user did not proceed to add any item, instead they clicked on other parts of the page (like the "Saladmixvery healthy" and "MojitoSuper Minti").
   4) [Step 4] The user clicked on the back button or navigated away from the page, indicating that they left the session.

   I have considered all the logs provided in making this decision.
