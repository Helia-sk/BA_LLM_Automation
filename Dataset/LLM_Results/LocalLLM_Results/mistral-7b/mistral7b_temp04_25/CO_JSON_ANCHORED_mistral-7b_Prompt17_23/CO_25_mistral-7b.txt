==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user initiated a task (clicking on the "Menu" button to navigate to the menu page) but did not complete any other tasks that could be considered as part of the conversion process. The user then scrolled and clicked on an element, but these actions do not contribute to the conversion goal in this context.

  1) [Step 1] User opened the web application (web-1.4.2).
  2) [Step 2] User navigated to the dashboard page (/restaurant/dashboard/menu).
  3) [Step 3] User clicked on the "Menu" button, initiating a task to navigate to the menu page.
  4) [Step 4] User scrolled down the page.
  5) [Step 5] User clicked on an element within the page (an SVG).
  6) [Step 6] The user did not perform any other actions that could be considered as part of the conversion process, indicating a drop-off.

The analysis is based on the initiated task and the completion of those tasks that contribute to the conversion goal. Since the user did not complete any additional tasks that contribute to the conversion, the session is classified as a drop-off. All the logs were considered in this decision.
