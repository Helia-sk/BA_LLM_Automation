==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user clicked on the "Customer Login" link, but did not complete any further tasks related to logging in. Instead, the session ended with a page view of the homepage ("/") after navigating away from the login page.

1) [Step 1] The user navigated from the restaurant dashboard settings to the homepage (http://localhost:5173/).
2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "Customer Login" link located at x = 1659, y = 19.
3) [Step 3] The user clicked on the username input field on the login page.
4) [Step 4] The user did not perform any further actions related to logging in and instead navigated away from the login page by viewing the homepage (http://localhost:5173/).

All initiated tasks were not completed, so the session was a drop-off. The user journey ended with a view of the homepage without logging in. It's essential to consider all the logs to ensure an accurate classification of the session.
