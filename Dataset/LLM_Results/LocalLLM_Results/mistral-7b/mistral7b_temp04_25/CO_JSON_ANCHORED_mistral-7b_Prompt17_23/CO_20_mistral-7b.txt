==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: One of the initiated tasks was abandoned. The user clicked on the "Hungry? Order delicious food from local restaurants" link, but did not return to complete the login process.

   User Journey:
   1) [Step 1] The user arrived at the homepage (`/customer/login`) with a width of 1920 pixels and a height of 911 pixels.
   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "Username" input field (x: 1016, y: 297). This indicates that the user initiated the login process.
   3) [Step 3] The user clicked on the "Password" input field (not logged in the provided logs), indicating continued engagement with the login process.
   4) [Step 4] The user clicked on the "Sign In" button (not logged in the provided logs), which would typically complete the login process if it had been present. However, the user did not click on this button or any other element that could be associated with completing the login process.
   5) [Step 5] The user clicked on the "Hungry? Order delicious food from local restaurants" link (x: 1197, y: 430), indicating a shift in focus away from the login process and towards another part of the website.
   Since the user did not return to complete the login process after clicking on the link, this session can be classified as a drop-off.
