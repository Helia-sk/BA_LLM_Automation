 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user initiated tasks such as clicking on "Orders", "Balance", and "View Details" but did not complete any of them, indicating that they left the session without completing a purchase or any other intended action.

  1) [Step 1] User logged into their account (implied by the "session_id").
  2) [Step 2] User clicked on the "Orders" link to view their orders.
  3) [Step 3] User clicked on the "Balance" link to check their balance.
  4) [Step 4] User clicked on the "View Details" button for one of their orders.
  5) [Step 5] User clicked on the "Orders" link again, suggesting they might have wanted to go back to their orders but did not complete any further actions, indicating they left the session.

All the initiated tasks were not completed, hence the session was a drop-off. The user journey ended with the user leaving the session without completing any intended action.
