==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user initiated a task (clicked on "History") but did not complete it by clicking on any other elements in the history page. Instead, they clicked on the "Reject" button, which suggests that they decided to leave the history page without further interaction.

  1) [Step 1] The user navigated to the restaurant dashboard page (/restaurant/dashboard).
  2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "History" link located at x = 676, y = 126.
  3) [Step 3] The user arrived at the history page but did not interact with any other elements on that page except for the "Reject" button.
  4) [Step 4] The user clicked on the "Reject" button located at x = 1538, y = 298, which is an indication that they decided to leave the history page without further interaction. This action suggests a drop-off as one of the initiated tasks (viewing the details of a specific order) was abandoned.

   The user journey ended with a drop-off, as the user did not complete any other initiated tasks on the history page. It is essential to note that all logs were considered in this analysis.
