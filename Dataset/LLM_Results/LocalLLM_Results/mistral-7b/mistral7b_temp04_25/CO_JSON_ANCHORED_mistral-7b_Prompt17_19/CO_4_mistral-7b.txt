 Tag: Conversion

   Reason: The user initiated a task (clicking on the "Restaurant Login" link) and completed it by entering their username and password, indicating a successful login. The user then clicked on the button to submit the form, which is another completed task. Finally, the user clicked on the link "Already have an account? Sign in", but this can be considered as navigating within the same page and does not necessarily indicate abandonment of the initial task.

   1) The user landed on the Restaurant Login page (indicated by clicking on the "Restaurant Login" link).
   2) The user initiated the login process by clicking on the username input field.
   3) The user entered their username in the input field.
   4) The user clicked on the password input field to enter their password.
   5) The user entered their password in the input field.
   6) The user clicked on the "Sign In" button to submit the form.
   7) The user navigated to another link within the same page, "Already have an account? Sign in", but this does not indicate abandonment of the initial task as they were likely just checking if they had an account or not.
