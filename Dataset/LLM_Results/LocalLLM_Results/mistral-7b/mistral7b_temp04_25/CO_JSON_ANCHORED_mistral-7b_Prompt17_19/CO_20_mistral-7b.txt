 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: One of the initiated tasks was abandoned. The user clicked on the "Hungry? Order delicious food from local restaurants" link, which indicates an interest in leaving the login page, but did not complete any further actions related to logging in or placing an order.

   User Journey:
   1) [Step 1] The user navigated to the login page of the application (http://localhost:5173/customer/login).
   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the username input field, indicating they intended to enter their username.
   3) [Step 3] The user clicked on the password input field, suggesting they would enter their password next.
   4) [Step 4] The user did not enter any text in either the username or password fields, and instead, clicked on a link outside of the login form, indicating they were leaving the login page.
   5) [Step 5] The user clicked on the "Hungry? Order delicious food from local restaurants" link, which took them away from the login page.
   This user did not complete any further actions related to logging in or placing an order, so the session was considered a drop-off.
