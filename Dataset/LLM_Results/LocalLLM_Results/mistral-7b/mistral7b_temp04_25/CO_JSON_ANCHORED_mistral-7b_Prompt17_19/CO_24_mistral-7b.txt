==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: One of the initiated tasks (uploading an image for a menu item) was abandoned, indicating that the user did not complete all tasks.

   1) [Step 1] The user navigated to the restaurant dashboard page ("http://localhost:5173/restaurant/dashboard/menu") and clicked on the "Menu" link.
   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "ImageDrag image here or click to upload" area within the form.
   3) [Step 3] The user clicked somewhere else on the page, which was not a part of the form, indicating that they did not complete the task of uploading an image.
   4) [Step 4] The user clicked on the "Form" element, but it is unclear what specific action they performed within the form as the log does not provide details about the clicked element.
   5) [Step 5] The user clicked on an SVG element, but again, the log does not provide enough information to determine what action was taken.
   6) [Step 6] The user clicked on various elements within the page, but none of these actions led to the completion of a task or the submission of the form.

   The logs do not show any indication that the user completed all initiated tasks (uploading an image and submitting the form), so the session was classified as a drop-off.
