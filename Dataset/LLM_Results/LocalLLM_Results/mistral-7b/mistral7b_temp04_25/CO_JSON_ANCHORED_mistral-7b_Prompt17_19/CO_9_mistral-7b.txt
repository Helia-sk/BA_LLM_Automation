 Tag: Conversion
   Reason: All initiated tasks in this session were completed. The user navigated to the dashboard, scrolled through a restaurant page (restaurant/4), clicked on an image (which could be an indicator of interest), and then returned to the dashboard before scrolling again. Finally, the user clicked on the "Restaurants" link, indicating that they initiated another task (navigating to different restaurants) and completed it by clicking on the "Resaurants" link again, which suggests a conversion as they continued to interact with the application.
