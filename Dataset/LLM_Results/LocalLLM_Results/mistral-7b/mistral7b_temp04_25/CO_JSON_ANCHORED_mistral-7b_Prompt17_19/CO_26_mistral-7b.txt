  2) [Step 2] The user scrolled down the page and clicked on the "Starters" section.
  3) [Step 3] The user clicked on one of the items in the "Starters" section, which initiated the task to add an item.
  4) [Step 4] The user then clicked on the "Add Item" button, completing the task of adding an item to the menu.
  5) [Step 5] The user did not perform any other actions in this session that would indicate another initiated task, so it can be assumed that they have completed their interaction with the application.
