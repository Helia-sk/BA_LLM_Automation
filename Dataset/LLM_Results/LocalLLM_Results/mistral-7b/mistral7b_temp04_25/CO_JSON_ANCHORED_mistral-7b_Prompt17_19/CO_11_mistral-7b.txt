==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user initiated a task (scrolling through the page) but did not complete it, as indicated by multiple scroll events without any subsequent actions. The user never navigated to the specific restaurant page or performed any other action that could be considered a conversion.

   1) [Step 1] The user opened the application on their device (implied by the presence of the log file).
   2) [Step 2] The user navigated to the customer dashboard page.
   3) [Step 3] The user scrolled through the page multiple times, indicating an exploration of the available options. However, no further actions were taken after these scroll events.
   It is important to note that even though the user did not complete a task (navigating to a specific restaurant page or making a reservation), the log file does not provide information about whether the user closed the application or if the session was terminated due to inactivity. Therefore, it cannot be definitively concluded that this is a drop-off, but it is a reasonable assumption based on the available data.
   Additionally, it is worth considering that the user might have encountered issues or found the application unintuitive, which could have contributed to the lack of completion of initiated tasks. Further analysis and user feedback would be necessary to confirm these assumptions.
