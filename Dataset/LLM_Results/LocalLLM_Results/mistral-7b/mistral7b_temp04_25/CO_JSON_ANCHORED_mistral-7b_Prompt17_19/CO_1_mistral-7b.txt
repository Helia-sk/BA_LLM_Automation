 Tag: Conversion

   Reason: The user initiated a task (clicking on "Customer Login") and completed it by entering their username ("User1"). This was followed by another initiated task, typing the password, but it seems that this log does not contain the corresponding event for that action. However, since the user did not abandon the session before completing the initial task, we can classify this as a conversion.

   1) The user navigated to the website homepage (indicated by the click event on the "Customer Login" link).
   2) The user initiated the task of logging in by clicking on the "Customer Login" button.
   3) The user entered their username ("User1") into the username input field.
   4) Although not explicitly shown, it is assumed that the user entered their password since they completed the login process.
   5) The user successfully logged in, indicating a conversion.
