==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: Although the user initiated tasks (clicking on the "Restaurant Partners" link and filling out the username field), they did not complete the task of entering a password, which is a required step for login. Therefore, the session was not considered a conversion as one of the initiated tasks was abandoned.

  1) [Step 1] The user navigated to the Restaurant Partners page (http://localhost:5173/restaurant/login).
  2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "Register your restaurant or log in to manage orders" link, indicating an intent to either register a new account or login.
  3) [Step 3] The user filled out the username field with the value "User1".
  4) [Step 4] The user did not complete the task by filling out the password field, which is a required step for login. This indicates that the session was abandoned and thus tagged as a drop-off.

The analysis considered all the logs provided to make this decision.
