 Tag: Drop-Off

   Reason: The user initiated tasks by clicking on "History", but did not complete any of the subsequent actions such as "View Details". Since one of the initiated tasks was abandoned, the session is classified as a drop-off.

   1) [Step 1] The user accessed the dashboard page.
   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "History" link to access the history page.
   3) [Step 3] The user did not interact with any of the elements on the history page, indicating they may have left the page or closed it.
   4) [Step 4] No further interactions were recorded, suggesting that the session was abandoned.

   It is important to note that all logs were considered in this analysis. The user did not complete any of the initiated tasks, which meets the criteria for a drop-off.
