==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off

   Reason: The user initiated a task (clicking on the "Menu" link to navigate to the menu page) but did not complete any other tasks related to interacting with the menu items or making a selection. Instead, they scrolled and clicked within the page, which could indicate exploration or confusion, but no clear action towards completing a conversion (such as selecting an item or adding it to a cart).

   1) [Step 1] The user accessed the restaurant dashboard on the web application (web-1.4.2) at "http://localhost:5173/restaurant/dashboard/menu".
   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "Menu" link located at x=571, y=125.
   3) [Step 3] The user scrolled down the page to y=81 and then scrolled further to y=992.
   4) [Step 4] The user clicked within the page (an SVG element at x=1134, y=588), which may have been an unintended action or exploration of the page's content.
   However, it is important to note that no other actions related to interacting with the menu items were observed, and the user did not proceed to complete any further tasks towards a conversion (such as adding an item to a cart or making a selection). Therefore, this session was classified as a drop-off.
