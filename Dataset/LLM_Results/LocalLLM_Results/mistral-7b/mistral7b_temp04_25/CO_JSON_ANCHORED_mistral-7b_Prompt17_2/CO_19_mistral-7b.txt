==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user initiated a task (clicking on "Customer Login") but did not complete it, indicating that they dropped off before completing the intended action.

   1) [Step 1] User navigated to the homepage from the restaurant dashboard settings page ("/restaurant/dashboard/settings" to "/").
   2) [Step 2] User clicked on the "Customer Login" button, initiating the login process (click event on the "A" tag with text "Customer Login").
   3) [Step 3] User clicked on a blank input field in the username section of the login form, but did not enter any information or submit the form.
   4) [Step 4] The user then clicked outside of the login form, which suggests they may have decided to leave the page without completing the login process.
   It is important to note that while the user did click on the "Customer Login" button, they did not complete the intended action by entering their credentials and submitting the form. This indicates a drop-off in the user journey.

After reviewing all the logs, I have considered every initiated task and both of the conditions mentioned in the question. Since one of the initiated tasks (the login process) was abandoned, the session can be classified as a drop-off.
