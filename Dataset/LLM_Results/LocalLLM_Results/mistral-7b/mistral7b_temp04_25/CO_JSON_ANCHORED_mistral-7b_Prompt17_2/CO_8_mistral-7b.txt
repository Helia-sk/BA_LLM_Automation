==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off

   Reason: The user initiated the task of clicking on the "Customer Login" button, but did not complete the subsequent tasks such as entering a username and password. This indicates that the user abandoned the session before completing all initiated tasks.

   1) [Step 1] The user accessed the homepage of the website (URL: http://localhost:5173/).
   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "Customer Login" button located at x=627, y=38.
   3) [Step 3] The user moved the cursor to the username input field but did not click or interact with it (indicated by a click event on the username field without an interaction such as typing).
   4) [Step 4] The user moved the cursor to the password input field but did not click or interact with it (indicated by a click event on the password field without an interaction such as typing).
   5) [Step 5] The user clicked on the username input field, but did not type anything and then clicked away from the field (indicating that they may have intended to enter a username but changed their mind or encountered an issue).
   6) [Step 6] The user clicked on the password input field but did not type anything and then clicked away from the field (indicating that they may have intended to enter a password but changed their mind or encountered an issue).
   7) [Step 7] The session ended without any further interaction.

   Note: This analysis is based on the provided logs and assumes that the user's intended actions can be inferred from their clicks and cursor movements. If additional context or logs were available, the decision could potentially change. For example, if a JavaScript error occurred during the session, it might indicate that the user encountered an issue and abandoned the session due to that problem. However, without such information, it is not possible to make this determination with certainty.
