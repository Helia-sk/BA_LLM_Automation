 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: One of the initiated tasks (the user clicking on "Customer Login") was performed, but it appears that no further actions related to completing the login process were recorded in the logs provided. This suggests that the user may have abandoned the session after initiating the login process.

  1) [Step 1] The user navigated to the homepage of the website ("http://localhost:5173/").
  2) [Step 2] The user scrolled down the page to view its content.
  3) [Step 3] The user clicked on the "Customer Login" link located at the top right corner of the page.
  4) [Step 4] No further actions related to the login process were recorded in the logs, indicating that the user may have abandoned the session after initiating the login process.

   It is essential to note that the logs provided do not show any other interactions or tasks that could indicate a conversion, such as form submissions or product purchases. Furthermore, it is possible that subsequent actions related to the login process were not recorded in the logs due to technical issues or limitations of the logging system. However, based on the information available, it appears that this session was a drop-off.
