==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off

   Reason: The user initiated tasks by clicking on "Add Item", but did not complete any other task that could be considered a conversion, such as entering item details or uploading an image. Instead, the user clicked on "Saladmixvery healthy€0.08" and "best dessert everSuper sweet€1.00", which do not seem to be actions related to adding a new item to the menu. The user also did not click on any other buttons or links that could indicate completing the task of adding an item, such as "Save" or "Submit".

   1) [Step 1] The user navigated to the menu dashboard page (/restaurant/dashboard/menu).
   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "Add Item" button.
   3) [Step 3] The user clicked on two items in the list of menu items, but did not take any further action to add a new item.
   4) [Step 4] The user clicked on an SVG element, but its purpose is unclear and does not seem to be related to adding or managing menu items.

   I have considered all the logs provided in the log file for this analysis.
