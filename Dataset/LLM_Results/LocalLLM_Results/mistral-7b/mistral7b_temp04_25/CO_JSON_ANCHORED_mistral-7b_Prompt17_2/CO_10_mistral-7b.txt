 Tag: Drop-Off

   Reason: The user initiated tasks by clicking on "Balance", then "Orders", but did not complete either task. Instead, they clicked on "View Details" under Orders, but this action does not constitute a completed task as there is no corresponding log for a completion event. Finally, the user clicked on "X" to close the page, indicating that they left the site without completing any tasks.

   1) The user started the session by clicking on "Balance" (Indicated by the first log).
   2) The user then navigated to the "Orders" section by clicking on the corresponding link (Log 5).
   3) The user clicked on "View Details" under Orders, but did not complete any task related to this action (No corresponding log for completion event).
   4) The user clicked on the "X" button to close the page (Last log), indicating that they left the site without completing any tasks.

   All initiated tasks were not completed, so the session was a drop-off. It is important to note that all logs in this sequence were related to the customer dashboard, suggesting that the user was exploring their account but did not find what they were looking for or decide to take further action.
