 Tag: Drop-Off

   Reason: The user initiated a task (scrolling down on the dashboard page) but did not complete it, as indicated by the subsequent scroll events with decreasing y-coordinates. However, no further actions were taken after that, suggesting the user abandoned the session without completing any other tasks.

   1) [Step 1] The user accessed the customer dashboard (/customer/dashboard).
   2) [Step 2] The user scrolled down on the dashboard page to a point with y-coordinate 0 (first log).
   3) [Step 3] The user continued scrolling down further, reaching a y-coordinate of 1348.8 (second log), and then 310.39 (third log). This indicates the user was still interacting with the page but did not reach the bottom or complete any other tasks.
   4) [Step 4] The user did not take any further actions, suggesting they abandoned the session without completing any other initiated tasks.
