 Tag: Drop-Off

   Reason: The user initiated the task of clicking on the "Customer Login" link, but did not complete the subsequent tasks such as entering a username and password. This indicates that the user left the site without completing the login process, which is considered a drop-off in this context.

   1) [Step 1] The user accessed the homepage of the website (implied from the first log).
   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "Customer Login" link to initiate the login process.
   3) [Step 3] The user did not interact with the username or password input fields, indicating they did not enter any information.
   4) [Step 4] The user did not click on the "Submit" button or perform any other action that would indicate a successful login.
   5) [Step 5] The user left the site (implied from the fact that no further interactions were recorded).

   I have considered all the logs in my decision making process. The user did not complete all initiated tasks, which is why I classified this session as a drop-off.
