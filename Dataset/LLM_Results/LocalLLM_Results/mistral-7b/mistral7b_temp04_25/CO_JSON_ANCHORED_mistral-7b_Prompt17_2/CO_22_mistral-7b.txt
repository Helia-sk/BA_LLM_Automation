  2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "Restaurant Partners" link, indicating an intention to register or log in.
  3) [Step 3] The user entered a username ("User1") into the username field.
  4) [Step 4] The user did not enter a password, which indicates that they abandoned the process, thus classifying this session as a drop-off.
