==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user initiated a task by clicking on the "Customer Login" link, but did not complete it. Instead, they clicked on an input field for the username and then on the password field, which suggests that they intended to log in, but did not actually do so. This indicates that one of the initiated tasks (logging in) was abandoned, making this a drop-off session.

   User Journey:
   1) [Step 1] The user navigated to the homepage from the restaurant dashboard settings page.
   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "Customer Login" link, indicating an intention to log in.
   3) [Step 3] The user clicked on the username input field without entering any data, suggesting they intended to type their username but did not.
   4) [Step 4] The user clicked on the password input field, again without entering any data, indicating they intended to type their password but did not.
   5) [Step 5] The user did not perform any further actions that could be considered a completed task, suggesting they abandoned the session after clicking on the login fields.
