 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user initiated tasks by clicking on the "Customer Login" link, but did not complete any of the subsequent tasks such as entering a username or password. The user clicked on the username input field and the password input field, but did not enter any information in either field before leaving the page.

   User Journey:
   1) [Step 1] The user navigated to the customer login page by clicking on the "Customer Login" link.
   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the username input field but did not enter any information.
   3) [Step 3] The user clicked on the password input field but did not enter any information.
   4) [Step 4] The user left the page without completing the login process.
   I have considered all the logs provided in the log file to make this determination.
