==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user clicked on the "Customer Login" button, but no subsequent logs indicate that they completed the login process or any other tasks on the website. Instead, there are multiple scroll events and a single scroll event after the login button click, which suggests that the user may have scrolled through the page but did not interact with it further.

  1) The user navigated to the homepage ("/").
  2) The user scrolled down the homepage.
  3) The user clicked on the "Customer Login" button.
  4) The user scrolled down the customer login page.
  5) The user scrolled up the customer login page.
  6) The user scrolled down the customer login page again.
  7) The user scrolled up the customer login page once more.
  8) The user scrolled down the customer login page for the fourth time.
  9) The user scrolled up the customer login page, and no further interactions were recorded.

All initiated tasks (navigating to the homepage and clicking on the "Customer Login" button) were not completed, so the session was a drop-off.
