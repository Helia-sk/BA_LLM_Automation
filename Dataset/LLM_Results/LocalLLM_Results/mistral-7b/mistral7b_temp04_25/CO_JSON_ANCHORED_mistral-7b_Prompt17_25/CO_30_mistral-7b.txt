==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: One of the initiated tasks (View Details) was not completed, indicating that the user did not finish the intended action.

   Step 1) The user navigated to the restaurant dashboard page (/restaurant/dashboard).
   Step 2) The user clicked on the "History" link to view the history of the restaurant.
   Step 3) The user viewed a specific detail in the history, but did not complete the action by clicking on the "View Details" button for that item.
   Step 4) The user closed the page or navigated away from it, as indicated by the last log entry being a page view.
   Step 5) The user returned to the dashboard and clicked on the "History" link again, but this time did not click on any of the details in the history.
   Step 6) The user clicked on the "Reject" button for one of the items in the history, which is not a part of the intended action flow, and then left the page or navigated away from it, as indicated by the last log entry being a page view.
   Considering all the logs to the end, it appears that the user did not complete all initiated tasks (View Details for any item in the history), so the session was classified as a drop-off.
