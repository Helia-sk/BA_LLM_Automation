==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off

   Reason: The user initiated a task (clicking on the "Menu" link) but did not complete any of the subsequent tasks such as uploading an image, filling out the form for a category, or clicking on any other interactive elements. This indicates that the user abandoned the session without completing all the intended actions.

   1) [Step 1] The user accessed the restaurant dashboard page (http://localhost:5173/restaurant/dashboard/menu).
   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "Menu" link to navigate to the menu management section.
   3) [Step 3] The user hovered over an SVG element but did not click, indicating potential intent to interact but didn't follow through.
   4) [Step 4] The user moved the mouse over a form but did not click or fill out any information.
   5) [Step 5] The user clicked on an input field within an image drag area but did not actually drag and drop an image.
   6) [Step 6] The user hovered over another SVG element without clicking, indicating potential intent to interact but didn't follow through again.

   It is important to note that all the logs were considered in this decision making process. The user did not complete any of the initiated tasks, which leads to classifying this session as a drop-off.
