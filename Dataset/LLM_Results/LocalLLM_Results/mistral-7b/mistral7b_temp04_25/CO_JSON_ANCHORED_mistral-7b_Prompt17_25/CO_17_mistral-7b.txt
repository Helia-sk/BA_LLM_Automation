 Tag: Conversion

   Reason: All initiated tasks in this session were completed. The user navigated from the dashboard to the Restaurants page, scrolled down and clicked on a restaurant, then scrolled some more before clicking the "No image available" div, which might indicate waiting for an image to load, and finally clicked the "Add to Cart" button (implied by the "Added to cart" notification). No initiated tasks were abandoned.
