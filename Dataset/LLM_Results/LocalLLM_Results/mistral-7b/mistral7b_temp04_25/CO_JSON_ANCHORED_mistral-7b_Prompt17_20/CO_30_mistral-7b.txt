==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user initiated a task by clicking on "History", but did not complete it by viewing the details of any specific item. Instead, they clicked on "Reject All" and then left the page. This indicates that the user did not find what they were looking for or were not satisfied with the options presented to them, leading to an abandonment of the task.

   User Journey:
   1) [Step 1] The user navigated to the restaurant dashboard page (/restaurant/dashboard).
   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "History" link located at x=676, y=126.
   3) [Step 3] The user was presented with a list of items in the history section.
   4) [Step 4] Instead of selecting any item to view its details, the user clicked on "Reject All".
   5) [Step 5] The user left the page without taking any further action.
   It is important to note that the user did not complete any other initiated tasks during this session, such as viewing or accepting items, which further supports the classification of this session as a drop-off.
