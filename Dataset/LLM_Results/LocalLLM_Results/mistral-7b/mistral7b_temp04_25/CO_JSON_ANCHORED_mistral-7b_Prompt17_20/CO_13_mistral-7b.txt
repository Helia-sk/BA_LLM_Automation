==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user initiated a task (clicking on "History") but did not complete it. Instead, they clicked on another element ("View Details" and "X"), which suggests that they were exploring options but ultimately did not proceed with the intended action (viewing details).

  1) [Step 1] The user navigated to the restaurant dashboard page.
  2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "History" link in the navigation menu.
  3) [Step 3] The user clicked on two other elements ("View Details" and "X") without completing the intended action (viewing details).

   The logs provided do not show any further interaction suggesting that the user left the page or navigated away, which supports the classification of this session as a drop-off. It is essential to consider all logs when making such decisions to ensure accuracy.
