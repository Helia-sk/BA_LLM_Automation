 Tag: Conversion
   Reason: All initiated tasks in this session were completed. The user made a click event on the "Accept" button (indicating accepting an order), which is part of the order acceptance workflow, and there are no subsequent events suggesting that the task was abandoned.

   1) [Step 1] The user initiated an HTTP request to accept an order (`/api/orders/26/accept`) from the backend server with a User-Agent of "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/140.0.0.0 Safari/537.36".
   2) [Step 2] The server responded with an HTTP response status code of 200, indicating that the order acceptance was successful.
   3) [Step 3] A preflight request (OPTIONS method) was made to the same URL, which is a common practice for some web applications to check if the server supports certain methods before making requests. This request was also successful with an HTTP response status code of 200.
   4) [Step 4] The user then clicked on the "Accept" button on the frontend application, as indicated by a click event. This action is likely part of the order acceptance workflow, suggesting that the user has completed the task of accepting the order.
   5) [Step 5] No subsequent events were recorded in the log file, which suggests that the user did not abandon the session or initiate any other tasks after completing the order acceptance.
   Note: All logs have been considered to make this decision.
