==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user initiated a login process, but did not complete it by entering a password. Instead, they clicked on the "Sign In" button without providing any input in the password field. This indicates that the user abandoned the task of logging in, as one of the initiated tasks was not completed.

  1) [Step 1] The user navigated to the restaurant's website (route: /restaurant/login).
  2) [Step 2] The user entered their username (username_length: non-zero).
  3) [Step 3] The user clicked on the "Sign In" button (event_name: click), but did not provide any input in the password field.
  4) [Step 4] The user blurred the password field (event_name: blur), indicating they did not enter a password.

I have considered all the logs provided, as I have analyzed each event and its corresponding timestamp to understand the sequence of actions taken by the user.
