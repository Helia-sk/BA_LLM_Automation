 Tag: Drop-Off

   Reason: The user initiated a task (clicked on "Customer Login") but did not complete it. Instead, they clicked away from the login form and navigated to another page ("/"). This indicates that the user did not complete the intended action (logging in), suggesting a drop-off.

   1) [Step 1] The user was on the restaurant dashboard settings page (indicated by the referrer in the log).

   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "Customer Login" link, indicating an intention to log in.

   3) [Step 3] Instead of proceeding with the login process, the user navigated away from the login form and went to the homepage ("/"). This suggests that the user did not complete the intended action (logging in), which is a drop-off.

   I have considered all the logs provided. The user initially was on the restaurant dashboard settings page, clicked on the "Customer Login" link, but did not proceed with the login process, and instead navigated to the homepage, indicating a drop-off.
