 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user initiated tasks such as clicking on "Orders", "Balance", and "View Details" in the dashboard, but it appears that none of these tasks were completed. Instead, the user clicked on the "X" button to close the "View Details" popup, indicating they did not proceed with viewing details of an order. This suggests that the session was dropped off before a conversion could be considered complete.

   User Journey:
   1) [Step 1] The user logged into their account and landed on the customer dashboard.
   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "Orders" link in the dashboard to view their orders.
   3) [Step 3] The user clicked on the "Balance" link in the dashboard, but it is unclear if they intended to check their balance or if this was an accidental click.
   4) [Step 4] The user clicked on the "View Details" button for one of the orders.
   5) [Step 5] The user clicked on the "X" button to close the "View Details" popup, indicating they did not proceed with viewing details of the order. This suggests that the session was dropped off before a conversion could be considered complete.
