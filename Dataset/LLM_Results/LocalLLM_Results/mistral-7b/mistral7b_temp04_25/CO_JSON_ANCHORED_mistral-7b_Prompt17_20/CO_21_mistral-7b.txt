 Tag: Conversion

   Reason: The user initiated a navigation to the login page (log 5), clicked on the "Restaurant Partners" link (log 6) which led to the restaurant login/registration page, entered their username in the input field (log 7), clicked on the username input field again (log 8), and finally typed in a password in the password input field (log 9). This indicates that the user completed all initiated tasks, hence a conversion.
