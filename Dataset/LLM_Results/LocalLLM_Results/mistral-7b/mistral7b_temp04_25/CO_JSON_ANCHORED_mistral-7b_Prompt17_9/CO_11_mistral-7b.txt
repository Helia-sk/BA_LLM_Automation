==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user initiated a task (scrolling down on the dashboard page) but did not complete it, as indicated by subsequent scroll events without any further interaction that could be considered as completing a task. The user then navigated to the customer dashboard page but again did not perform any actions that would indicate a completed task or conversion.

  1) [Step 1] User started a new session on the customer dashboard page by accessing it (log_1757774276450_fntdti8qo).
  2) [Step 2] User scrolled down the page to a certain point (log_1757774275386_7sjdieux2, log_1757774274528_gt98ftf43).
  3) [Step 3] User navigated to the customer dashboard page (log_1757774274528_gt98ftf43).
  4) [Step 4] User scrolled down on the customer dashboard page but did not interact with any elements or complete any tasks (logs from log_1757774274528_gt98ftf43 to the end).

   I have considered all the logs in my decision making. The user did not perform any actions that would indicate a completed task or conversion, and therefore this session can be classified as a drop-off.
