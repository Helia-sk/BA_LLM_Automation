 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user initiated a task (clicking on the "Restaurant Partners Register your restaurant or log in to manage orders" link) but did not complete it, instead navigating away from the page. This indicates that the session was not successful in achieving the intended goal.

   1) [Step 1] The user visited the homepage ("/") of the application.
   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "Restaurant Partners Register your restaurant or log in to manage orders" link, indicating an intention to log in or register a restaurant.
   3) [Step 3] The user navigated away from the page ("http://localhost:5173/restaurant/login"), abandoning the initiated task and not completing it.
   In this case, all logs were considered to make the decision.
