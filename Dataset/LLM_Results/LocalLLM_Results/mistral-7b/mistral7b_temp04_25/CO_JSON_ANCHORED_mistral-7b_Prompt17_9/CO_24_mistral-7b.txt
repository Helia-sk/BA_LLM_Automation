 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: While the user initiated several tasks such as clicking on the "Menu" link, interacting with an SVG element, and navigating to the form for adding menu items, they did not complete any of these tasks. Specifically, they did not click the submit button on the form, which indicates that they may have abandoned the process before completing it.

   User Journey:
   1) [Step 1] The user accessed the restaurant dashboard page (URL: http://localhost:5173/restaurant/dashboard).
   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "Menu" link, which took them to the menu management page (URL: http://localhost:5173/restaurant/dashboard/menu).
   3) [Step 3] The user interacted with an SVG element but did not complete any action.
   4) [Step 4] The user navigated to a form for adding menu items, but they did not click the submit button, indicating that they may have abandoned the process.
   Since all initiated tasks were not completed, the session is classified as a drop-off.
