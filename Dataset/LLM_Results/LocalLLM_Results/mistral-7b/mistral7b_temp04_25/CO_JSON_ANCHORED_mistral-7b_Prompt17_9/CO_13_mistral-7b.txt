 Tag: Drop-Off

   Reason: The user initiated a task by clicking on the "History" link, but subsequently clicked on the "X" button which is typically used to close a window or dismiss an alert. This action suggests that the user may have decided not to proceed with viewing the history. However, it's important to note that we cannot definitively confirm this as there could be other reasons for clicking the "X" button. The user then clicked on another button labeled "View Details", but without further context, it's unclear if this was a different task or part of the same task.

   1) [Step 1] The user accessed the restaurant dashboard page.
   2) [Step 2] The user initiated a task by clicking on the "History" link.
   3) [Step 3] The user clicked on the "X" button, which may have closed the history window or dismissed an alert. This action suggests that the user may have decided not to proceed with viewing the history.
   4) [Step 4] The user clicked on the "View Details" button, but without further context, it's unclear if this was a different task or part of the same task. However, since the user did not complete all initiated tasks (viewing the history), we classify this session as a drop-off.
