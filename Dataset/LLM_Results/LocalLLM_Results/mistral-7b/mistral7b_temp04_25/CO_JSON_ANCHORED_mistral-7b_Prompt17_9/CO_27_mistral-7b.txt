 Tag: Conversion
   Reason: All initiated tasks were completed. The user made a click event on the "Accept" button, which seems to be an action related to accepting an order in the backend logs. This action was followed by successful HTTP responses for the same endpoint ("orders.accept_order"), indicating that the order was indeed accepted.

  1) [Step 1] The user initiated a request to accept an order from the backend (HTTP Request).
  2) [Step 2] The backend responded with an OPTIONS method, which is typically used to check if the server supports certain HTTP methods. This indicates that the backend was preparing for the incoming POST request.
  3) [Step 3] The user made a click event on the "Accept" button in the frontend application, triggering the acceptance of the order.
  4) [Step 4] The backend received the POST request and responded with an HTTP Response, indicating that the order was accepted successfully (HTTP Response).

All logs were considered to make this decision.
