 Tag: Conversion

   Reason: The user initiated a task (clicked on the "Menu" link) and completed it by navigating to the "Menu" page. After that, the user initiated another task (clicking on the "Add Item" button), which indicates an intention to interact further with the application, such as adding an item to the menu. The fact that no subsequent logs show the user abandoning this task suggests that they may have completed it successfully. The final log shows the user leaving the page, but since all initiated tasks were completed, we can consider this a conversion.
