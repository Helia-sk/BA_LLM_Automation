 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: Although the user initiated a click on the "Customer Login" link, they did not complete any subsequent tasks that would indicate a successful login. Instead, the user scrolled through the page but did not interact with any other elements, and eventually left the site by scrolling back to the homepage.

  1) [Step 1] The user navigated to the homepage of the website (http://localhost:5173/).
  2) [Step 2] The user scrolled down the page to view its content.
  3) [Step 3] The user clicked on the "Customer Login" link located at the top right corner of the page.
  4) [Step 4] The user scrolled back up to the homepage (http://localhost:5173/).
  5) [Step 5] The user scrolled down the homepage again but did not interact with any other elements.
  6) [Step 6] The user left the site by closing the browser or navigating away from it.

   It is essential to consider all the logs in the log file to make an informed decision about whether the session was a drop-off or a conversion. In this case, since the user did not complete any initiated tasks related to logging in, we can classify this session as a drop-off.
