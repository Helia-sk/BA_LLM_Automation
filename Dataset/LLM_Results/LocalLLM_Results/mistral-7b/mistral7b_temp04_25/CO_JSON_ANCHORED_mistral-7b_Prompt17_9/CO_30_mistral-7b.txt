==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user initiated a task (clicked on "History") but did not complete it by clicking on the "View Details" button. Instead, they clicked on the "Reject" button. This indicates that the user did not find the details they were looking for in the history section and chose to leave the page without completing any other tasks.

  1) [Step 1] The user navigated to the restaurant dashboard page (/restaurant/dashboard).
  2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "History" link located at x = 676, y = 126.
  3) [Step 3] The user did not click on any other links or buttons in the history section.
  4) [Step 4] The user clicked on the "Reject" button (x = 1538, y = 298).
  5) [Step 5] The user navigated away from the page, indicating that they left the application without completing any other tasks.

   I have considered all the logs in my decision making process and have determined that this session was a drop-off because the user initiated a task (clicking on "History") but did not complete it by clicking on the "View Details" button, which is an indication of abandonment.
