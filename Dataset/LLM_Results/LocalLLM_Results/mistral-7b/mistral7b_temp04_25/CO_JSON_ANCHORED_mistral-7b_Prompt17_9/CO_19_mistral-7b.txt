==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user initiated a task (clicking on the "Customer Login" link) but did not complete it, as there are no subsequent logs indicating that they entered their credentials or performed any action related to the login process.

   1) [Step 1] User navigated from "/restaurant/dashboard/settings" to the homepage ("/") at 2025-09-27T14:18:55.683Z.
   2) [Step 2] At 2025-09-27T14:19:05.841Z, the user clicked on the "Customer Login" link.
   3) [Step 3] No subsequent logs indicate that the user entered their credentials or performed any action related to the login process.
   I have considered all the logs in my decision making and have determined that this session was a drop-off because the initiated task (customer login) was abandoned.
