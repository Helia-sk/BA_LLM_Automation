==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off

   Reason: The user initiated a task (clicking on the "Customer Login" link) but did not complete it. Instead, they clicked on an element within the form but did not fill out any information and did not submit the form. This indicates that the user may have abandoned the session before completing the intended action.

   1) [Step 1] The user navigated to the homepage of the website (indicated by the first log with the URL "/").
   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "Customer Login" link (log with attempt_id "log_1757773371689_3ak46jhcx").
   3) [Step 3] The user navigated to the login page (indicated by the URL "/customer/login" in the next log).
   4) [Step 4] The user clicked on an input field within the form (log with attempt_id "log_1757773373072_scoku9tbi"). However, they did not fill out any information or submit the form.
   5) [Step 5] The user clicked outside of the form (log with attempt_id "log_1757773372596_2oj0c59xu"), suggesting they may have navigated away from the page without completing the login process. This indicates that the user abandoned the session before completing the intended action, classifying this as a drop-off.

   I have considered all the logs in my decision making and have not made any assumptions or guessed at missing information.
