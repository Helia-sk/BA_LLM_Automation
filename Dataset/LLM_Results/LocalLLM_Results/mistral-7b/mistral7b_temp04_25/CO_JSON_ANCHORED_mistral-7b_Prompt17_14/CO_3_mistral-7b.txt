 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user initiated tasks (clicking on "Restaurant Login" and clicking on the username input field), but did not complete the task of entering a username or password. This indicates that the user left the session without completing the login process, which is considered a drop-off.

   User Journey:
   1) [Step 1] The user clicked on the link for "Restaurant Login".
   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the username input field (indicating they intended to enter their username).
   3) [Step 3] The user did not complete the task of entering a username or password, and did not perform any other actions that would indicate completion of the login process. This suggests that the user left the session without logging in, which is considered a drop-off.
