 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: Not all initiated tasks were completed. The user clicked on "History" (Step 1), then clicked on "View Details" (Step 2), but subsequently clicked on the "Reject" button (Step 3). However, the user did not complete any other initiated tasks such as making a purchase or filling out a form, which would have classified this session as a conversion.

   Here is the user journey step-by-step:
   1) The user navigated to the restaurant dashboard page (/restaurant/dashboard).
   2) The user clicked on the "History" link (Step 1).
   3) The user clicked on the "View Details" button for a specific item in the history (Step 2).
   4) The user clicked on the "Reject" button, indicating they did not want to proceed with that particular item (Step 3).
   The user did not initiate or complete any other tasks during this session.
