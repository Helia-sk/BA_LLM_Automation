 Tag: Drop-Off

   Reason: The user initiated a task (clicking on "Customer Login") but did not complete another initiated task (entering username and password). This indicates that the user abandoned the session before completing the login process.

   1) [Step 1] User navigated to the homepage ("http://localhost:5173/customer/login").
   2) [Step 2] User clicked on the "Customer Login" button (indicated by a click event).
   3) [Step 3] User clicked on the username input field but did not enter any information.
   4) [Step 4] User clicked on the password input field but did not enter any information.
   5) [Step 5] The session ended without the user submitting the login form, indicating a drop-off.

   It is important to note that all logs were considered in this analysis. The user clicked on the username and password fields, which are typically the next steps after clicking the "Customer Login" button, but did not enter any information. This suggests that the user intended to log in but abandoned the process before completing it.
