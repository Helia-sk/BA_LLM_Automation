==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user initiated a task (clicking on the "Customer Login" link) but did not complete it. Instead, they clicked away from the page without performing any action in the input field for the username.

   1) [Step 1] The user navigated to the homepage of the website ("http://localhost:5173/") from another page ("http://localhost:5173/restaurant/dashboard/settings").
   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "Customer Login" link, which took them to the customer login page.
   3) [Step 3] The user did not interact with the username input field or the password input field, indicating they were not intending to log in.
   4) [Step 4] The user clicked away from the customer login page, likely navigating to another part of the website or closing the browser tab.
   Note: All logs have been considered in this decision making process. The user did not complete any initiated tasks (login), so the session is classified as a drop-off.
