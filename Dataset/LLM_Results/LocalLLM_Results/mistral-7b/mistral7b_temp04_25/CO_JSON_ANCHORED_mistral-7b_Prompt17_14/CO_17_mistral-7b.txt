 Tag: Conversion

   Reason: The user initiated two tasks (visiting the "Restaurants" page and selecting a specific restaurant, identified by the URL "/customer/dashboard/restaurant/9") and completed both of them. The session ended with an action (clicking the "Add to Cart" button on the restaurant's page), which indicates that the user completed the intended purpose of their visit, making it a conversion.

   1) [Step 1] The user visited the main dashboard ("/customer/dashboard").
   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "Restaurants" link to navigate to the restaurants page.
   3) [Step 3] The user scrolled down the restaurants page and clicked on a specific restaurant, identified by the URL "/customer/dashboard/restaurant/9".
   4) [Step 4] The user scrolled further down the restaurant's page to view more details, such as the image.
   5) [Step 5] The user continued scrolling and reached the bottom of the page.
   6) [Step 6] The user clicked on the "Add to Cart" button, which indicates that they completed their intended action and converted.
   I have considered all the logs provided in making this decision.
