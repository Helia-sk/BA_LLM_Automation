   3) [Step 3] The user did not provide any input in the username or password fields, indicating they were not going to complete the login process.
   4) [Step 4] The user clicked on the "Sign In" button again, but this time without any input, which further confirms that they are abandoning the task.
   5) [Step 5] The user navigated away from the login page by clicking on a different link or closing the browser tab, marking the end of their session.
