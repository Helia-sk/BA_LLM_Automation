==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user initiated the login process by clicking on the "Username" input field, but did not provide a username. This indicates that the user abandoned the login process without completing it.

   1) [Step 1] The user navigated to the restaurant partner's login page ("/restaurant/login").
   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "Username" input field to begin the login process.
   3) [Step 3] The user did not provide a username, indicating that they abandoned the login process.
   4) [Step 4] The user clicked on the "Password" input field, but this action was not followed by any further interaction, suggesting that they did not intend to continue with the login process.
   5) [Step 5] The user clicked on the "Password" input field again, but still did not provide a password or attempt to log in.
   6) [Step 6] The user clicked on the link "Restaurant PartnersRegister your restaurant or log in to manage orders", possibly intending to register instead of logging in, but this action was also not followed by any further interaction.

It is important to note that while the user did click on additional elements after initially attempting the login process, these actions do not contribute to a successful conversion as they were not part of the intended login process. Therefore, the session was a drop-off.
