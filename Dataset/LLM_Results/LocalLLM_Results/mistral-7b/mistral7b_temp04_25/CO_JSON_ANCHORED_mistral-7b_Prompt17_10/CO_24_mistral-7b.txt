 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: One of the initiated tasks (uploading an image for a menu item) was abandoned, as there is no subsequent log indicating that this task was completed.

   User Journey:
   1) [Step 1] The user navigated to the restaurant dashboard page (/restaurant/dashboard/menu).
   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "Menu" button located at x = 586, y = 124.
   3) [Step 3] The user clicked on the "Form" element with id="". This form contained options for different categories such as Starters, Main Courses, Desserts, Drinks, Side Dishes and a space to upload an image.
   4) [Step 4] The user clicked on the SVG element located at x = 664, y = 338, but there is no subsequent log indicating that this action was part of completing a task.
   5) [Step 5] The user clicked on an input field within the form, but there is no subsequent log indicating that this action was part of completing a task.
   6) [Step 6] The user clicked on another SVG element located at x = 889, y = 695, but there is no subsequent log indicating that this action was part of completing a task.
   7) [Step 7] The user clicked on an input field within the form again, but there is no subsequent log indicating that this action was part of completing a task.
   at the end Check: All the logs have been considered and no subsequent log indicates completion of all initiated tasks, so the session was classified as a drop-off.
