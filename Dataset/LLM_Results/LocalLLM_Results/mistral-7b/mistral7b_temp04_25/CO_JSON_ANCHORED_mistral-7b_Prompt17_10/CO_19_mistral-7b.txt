 Tag: Drop-Off

   Reason: The user initiated a task (clicking on "Customer Login") but did not complete it. Instead, they navigated away from the login page without providing any username or password. This indicates that the user did not complete the intended action and left the site, which is characteristic of a drop-off session.

   1) [Step 1] The user navigated to the restaurant dashboard settings page (indicated by the "page_view" event).
   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "Customer Login" link (indicated by the "click" event).
   3) [Step 3] The user did not interact with the username or password input fields, nor did they submit the login form. Instead, they navigated away from the login page (indicated by another "page_view" event). This suggests that the user abandoned the login process without logging in.
   4) [Step 4] The user navigated back to the homepage (indicated by another "page_view" event). However, this does not change the fact that they did not complete the intended action of logging in, which is characteristic of a drop-off session.
