==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user clicked on the "Customer Login" link, but did not complete the subsequent steps of providing a username and password. Instead, they navigated away from the form by clicking outside of it. This indicates that the user did not complete the intended action (logging in), so the session can be classified as a drop-off.

   Here is the user journey step-by-step:
   1) The user clicked on the "Customer Login" link, indicating they wanted to log in.
   2) The user navigated to the login form.
   3) The user clicked on the username input field, but did not enter any text or perform any other action on it.
   4) The user clicked outside of the form, which is an indication that they have abandoned the session without completing the intended action (logging in).
