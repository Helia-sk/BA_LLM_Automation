==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user initiated an action (accepting an order) on the backend side, but this action was not followed by any subsequent frontend actions that would indicate completion of the task. Instead, there are two frontend clicks (on a button and an SVG element) that do not seem to be related to accepting or completing an order.

   User Journey:
   1) [Step 1] The user made a request to accept an order on the backend side with a POST request at "http://localhost:5050/api/orders/26/accept" (log_id: 34ad601b-539f-4035-a106-7ddac540e434).
   2) [Step 2] The backend responded with an OPTIONS request at the same URL, indicating that it was checking for allowed HTTP methods (log_id: d574513a-4ec9-43d8-9580-9e8634754b75).
   3) [Step 3] The user made two clicks on the frontend, but these actions do not seem to be related to accepting or completing an order (logs with id log_1758985714781_pjjhy0zwj and log_1758985707836_95fu2oszs).
   It is important to note that the order acceptance action on the backend was not followed by any subsequent actions that would indicate completion of the task, which is why we classify this session as a drop-off.
