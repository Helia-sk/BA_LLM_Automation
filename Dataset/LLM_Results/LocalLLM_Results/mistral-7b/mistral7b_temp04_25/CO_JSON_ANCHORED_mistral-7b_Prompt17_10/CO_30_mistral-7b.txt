 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user initiated a task by clicking on "History", but did not complete it by viewing the details. Instead, they clicked on "Reject" which indicates an abandonment of that specific task. Additionally, the user did not perform any other tasks that could be considered as part of a conversion.

  1) [Step 1] The user navigated to the restaurant dashboard page (/restaurant/dashboard).
  2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "History" link, indicating an intention to view the history of the restaurant.
  3) [Step 3] The user clicked on the "Reject" button instead of viewing the details, suggesting that they abandoned the task of viewing the history.
  4) [Step 4] The user clicked on the "History" link again, but this time they clicked on "View Details" for a specific item in the history. However, they did not complete this action by actually viewing the details.
  5) [Step 5] The user clicked on the "Reject" button once more, which could indicate that they were rejecting the selected item or possibly navigating away from the page.
  6) [Step 6] The user clicked on the "History" link one last time, but there is no further interaction recorded in the log file, suggesting that they may have left the page without completing any other tasks.
