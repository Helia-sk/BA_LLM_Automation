 Tag: Conversion

   Reason: The user initiated the task of navigating to the Customer Login page, clicked on the login input field for the username, entered their username ("User1"), clicked on the login input field again for the password (not shown in logs), and then clicked the "Customer Login" button. All initiated tasks were completed, so this session can be classified as a conversion.

   1) The user navigated to the Customer Login page by clicking the "Customer Login" link.
   2) The user clicked on the username input field.
   3) The user entered their username ("User1") in the username input field.
   4) The user clicked on the password input field, but this action was not logged.
   5) The user entered their password (not shown in logs).
   6) The user clicked the "Customer Login" button to submit their login credentials.
   Note: Although the password entry and submission were not logged, it is reasonable to assume that these actions occurred based on the user's interaction with the username input field and the "Customer Login" button.
