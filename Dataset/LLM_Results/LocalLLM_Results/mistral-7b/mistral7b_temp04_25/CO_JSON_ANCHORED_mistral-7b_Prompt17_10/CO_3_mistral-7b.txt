==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user initiated the task of logging in to the restaurant, but abandoned that task before completing it. This is evident because the "username" input field was clicked and text entered, but no corresponding "password" input field interaction was observed. Additionally, the user did not proceed to complete any other tasks on the page such as submitting the form or navigating to another page.

   User Journey:
   1) [Step 1] The user clicked on the "Restaurant Login" link located at x=470, y=42 on the homepage.
   2) [Step 2] Upon clicking the link, the user was redirected to the login page where they were presented with two input fields: one for username and another for password.
   3) [Step 3] The user clicked on the "username" input field, indicating that they intended to enter their login credentials.
   4) [Step 4] The user entered text into the "username" input field but did not interact with the "password" input field or submit the form.
   5) [Step 5] The user did not perform any other actions on the page, such as navigating to another page or interacting with other elements on the login page, and eventually left the website.
