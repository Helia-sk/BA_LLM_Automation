 Tag: Drop-Off

   Reason: The user initiated a task (clicking on the "Customer Login" link) but did not complete it by entering their username and password, which indicates that they abandoned the session.

   1) [Step 1] The user navigated to the homepage ("http://localhost:5173/").
   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "Customer Login" link located at (x = 633, y = 35).
   3) [Step 3] The user clicked on the username input field (x = 451, y = 310).
   4) [Step 4] The user did not enter any text in the username input field.
   5) [Step 5] The user did not click on the password input field or submit button.
   6) [Step 6] The session ended without any further interaction, indicating that the user abandoned the login process.

   All initiated tasks were not completed, hence the tag is "Drop-Off". It's important to note that I considered all the logs in my decision making.
