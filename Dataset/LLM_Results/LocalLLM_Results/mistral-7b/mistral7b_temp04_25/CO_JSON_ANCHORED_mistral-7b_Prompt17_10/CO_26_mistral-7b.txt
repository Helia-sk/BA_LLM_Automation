==================================================

 Tag: Conversion

   Reason: The user initiated two tasks (clicking on "Add Item" and selecting a category) and completed both of them, indicating that they were able to successfully add an item to their cart. This is consistent with a conversion event.

   1) [Step 1] The user accessed the restaurant's menu page (http://localhost:5173/restaurant/dashboard/menu).
   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "Add Item" button, which initiated the process of adding an item to their cart.
   3) [Step 3] The user navigated through the menu categories (Starters, Main Courses, Desserts, Drinks, Side Dishes) and selected a category (in this case, it appears they clicked on "All Items").
   4) [Step 4] The user interacted with the list of items, suggesting they were browsing through the available options.
   5) [Step 5] The user clicked on an item to add it to their cart (although the specific item is not specified in the log file).
   6) [Step 6] The user confirmed their action by clicking on another item or area, indicating that they had successfully added an item to their cart.
   I have considered all the logs provided to make this decision.
