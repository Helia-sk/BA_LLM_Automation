==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user initiated a task (scrolling down the page) but did not complete it, indicating that they left the page without completing any of the tasks.

   1) [Step 1] The user accessed the customer dashboard at "http://localhost:5173/customer/dashboard".
   2) [Step 2] The user scrolled down the page (scroll event).
   3) [Step 3] The user scrolled further down the page (another scroll event), indicating they were still exploring.
   4) [Step 4] The user clicked on a restaurant link to view more details ("/customer/dashboard/restaurant/4").
   5) [Step 5] The user scrolled down the restaurant details page (scroll event).
   6) [Step 6] The user clicked on an image, presumably expecting to see more details about the restaurant, but it was a placeholder ("No image available").
   7) [Step 7] The user continued scrolling down the restaurant details page (another scroll event), but then stopped scrolling (scroll event). This suggests that they may have been disappointed by the lack of an image and decided to leave the page.
   After this point, the user did not initiate any other tasks or events, so it can be inferred that they left the page without completing any of the tasks. Therefore, the session was a drop-off.
