 Tag: Conversion
   Reason: The user initiated a task (clicked on the "Menu" link) and completed it by navigating to the "Menu" page. After that, the user initiated another task (clicked on the "Add Item" button), which is an action typically associated with adding a new item in a menu, indicating a conversion.

  1) The user accessed the homepage of the restaurant website. [Reason: This is the initial point where the session started.]
  2) The user clicked on the "Menu" link to navigate to the Menu page. [Reason: This action indicates an initiated task.]
  3) The user stayed on the Menu page, which suggests they were reviewing the menu options.
  4) The user initiated another task by clicking on the "Add Item" button, indicating that they wanted to add a new item to the menu. [Reason: This action is typically associated with a conversion.]
  5) No further logs suggest that the user abandoned the session or didn't complete the "Add Item" task, so it can be assumed that they completed this task.
  6) The session ended without any other actions, but since all initiated tasks were completed, it can be classified as a conversion.
