==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: Although the user initiated tasks such as clicking on the "Customer Login" link, entering their username, and clicking on the username input field, they did not complete the task of actually typing in a username or password. This indicates that they may have left the page before completing the login process, which is considered a drop-off.

   User Journey:
   1) [Step 1] The user navigated to the customer login page by clicking on the "Customer Login" link.
   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the username input field.
   3) [Step 3] The user did not type anything in the username input field and did not proceed to enter a password, indicating they may have left the page.
   I have considered all the logs provided, as they detail every initiated task by the user and their completion status.
