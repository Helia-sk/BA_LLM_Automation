 Tag: Conversion

   Reason: The user initiated a task (scrolling down the page) and completed it (reached the bottom of the page). After that, the user clicked on a link to navigate to another page ("/customer/dashboard/restaurant/4"). This action indicates that the user was actively engaging with the content. Later, the user clicked on an image, which could be considered as exploring more about the restaurant. However, since no further actions were recorded after this click, it's unclear if the user left the page or continued to explore. But since the user initially engaged in a task and completed it, we can classify this session as a conversion.

   1) The user landed on the homepage ("/customer/dashboard").
   2) The user scrolled down the page (indicating initial engagement).
   3) The user clicked on a link to navigate to another page ("/customer/dashboard/restaurant/4"), indicating continued engagement.
   4) The user clicked on an image, potentially exploring more about the restaurant. However, no further actions were recorded after this click, making it unclear if the user left the page or continued to explore.
