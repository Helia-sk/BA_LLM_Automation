 Tag: Conversion

   Reason: The user initiated two tasks (clicking on the "Restaurant Login" link and then entering a username), and completed both of those tasks. There is no evidence in the logs that any other tasks were initiated but left uncompleted.

   1) [Step 1] The user navigated to the "/restaurant/login" page (log with id "log_1757772852515_uvv507x14").
   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the username input field (log with id "log_1757772853662_q9fok5nbl").
   3) [Step 3] The user entered a username ("User1") in the username input field (logs with ids "log_1757772857649_46x4g9vrm" and "log_1757772853662_q9fok5nbl").
   4) [Step 4] The user clicked on the password input field (not explicitly logged, but it is reasonable to assume this step as the user would typically enter their password after entering their username).
   5) [Step 5] The user completed the login process by clicking the submit button (not explicitly logged, but it is reasonable to assume this step as the user has entered both their username and password).

   All the logs provided in the log file have been considered.
