==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user initiated a task (clicking on the "Customer Login" link) but did not complete it by entering their username or password. This indicates an abandoned session, as the user did not proceed to the next step of the login process.

   Step 1) The user landed on the homepage.
   Step 2) The user clicked on the "Customer Login" link located at the top right corner of the page.
   Step 3) The user clicked on the username input field but did not enter any data, indicating they may have intended to type their username but left the page without doing so.
   Step 4) No further actions were recorded in the log file, suggesting the user navigated away from the site without completing the login process.

   All initiated tasks were not completed, hence the session was a drop-off. It is important to note that this analysis is based on the information provided in the log file and does not account for any external factors such as network issues or user distractions that may have occurred during the session.
