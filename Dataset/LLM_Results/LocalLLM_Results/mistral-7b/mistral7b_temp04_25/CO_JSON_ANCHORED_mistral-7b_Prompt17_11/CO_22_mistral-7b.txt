 Tag: Drop-Off

   Reason: The user initiated tasks such as clicking on the "Restaurant PartnersRegister your restaurant or log in to manage orders" link, entering a username ("User1"), and clicking on the username input field. However, the user did not complete the login process by entering a password or clicking the submit button.

   1) [Step 1] The user navigated to the "/restaurant/login" page (log_1758985133183_qr0zt2rti).
   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "Restaurant PartnersRegister your restaurant or log in to manage orders" link (log_1758985133183_ivi9skey6).
   3) [Step 3] The user moved the cursor over the username input field and clicked it (log_1758985133860_4znr19nye).
   4) [Step 4] The user entered a username "User1" into the username input field (log_1758985135389_wenesuzwe).
   5) [Step 5] The user did not complete the login process by entering a password or clicking the submit button. Instead, they left the page (implied from the lack of further logs indicating completion of the login process).

   I have considered all the logs to the end and made my decision based on the provided conditions. The user initiated tasks but did not complete them, so the session was a drop-off.
