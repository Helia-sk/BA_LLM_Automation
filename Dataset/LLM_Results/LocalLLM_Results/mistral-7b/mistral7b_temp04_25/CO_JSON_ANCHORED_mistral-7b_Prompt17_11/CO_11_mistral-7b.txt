 Tag: Drop-Off

   Reason: The user initiated a task by navigating to the dashboard (Step 1), but did not complete any of the subsequent tasks such as scrolling through the page, clicking on any links, or interacting with any elements. Instead, the user scrolled up and down on the page multiple times without taking any further action before leaving the site.

   1) [Step 1] The user navigated to the customer dashboard (/customer/dashboard).
   2) [Step 2] The user scrolled through the page, but did not click on any links or interact with any elements.
   3) [Step 3] The user continued scrolling up and down multiple times without taking any further action before leaving the site.

   I have considered all the logs in my decision making process, as the user initiated a task by navigating to the dashboard but did not complete any of the subsequent tasks, indicating a drop-off.
