 Tag: Conversion

   Reason: The user initiated two tasks (clicking on "Restaurants" and scrolling down to view a restaurant's details) and completed both of them by clicking on the restaurant's name. This indicates that the user was engaged and completed the intended action, which is viewing a restaurant's details.

   1) The user landed on the home page (/customer/dashboard).
   2) The user clicked on the "Restaurants" link.
   3) The user scrolled down to view a specific restaurant.
   4) The user clicked on the name of the restaurant to view its details.
   I have considered all the logs in my decision making as the user's actions were recorded for each event, and there is no evidence of the user abandoning any task before completion.
