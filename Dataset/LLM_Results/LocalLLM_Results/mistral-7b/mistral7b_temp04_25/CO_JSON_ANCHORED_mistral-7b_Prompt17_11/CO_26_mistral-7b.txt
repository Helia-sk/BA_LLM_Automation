 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: Although the user initiated tasks such as clicking on the "Add Item" button, they did not complete any other tasks related to adding an item to the menu. The initiated task was abandoned, which indicates a drop-off.

   1) [Step 1] The user accessed the restaurant's dashboard menu page (/restaurant/dashboard/menu).
   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "Add Item" button, indicating they intended to add a new item to the menu.
   3) [Step 3] The user navigated to the area where they could upload an image or text for the new item, but they did not perform any action there.
   4) [Step 4] The user clicked on the area below the "Add Item" button which contained information about other menu items, but again, no action was taken.
   5) [Step 5] The user clicked on an SVG element, but it is unclear what this action represents in the context of adding a new item to the menu.
   After reviewing all logs, it appears that the user initiated the task of adding a new item to the menu but did not complete it, indicating a drop-off.
