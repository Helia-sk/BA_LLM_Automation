==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user initiated an action (accepting an order on the backend) but did not complete it, as indicated by the HTTP request for the same endpoint followed by an OPTIONS request, which typically indicates a preflight check before making a request. However, there was no subsequent HTTP response with a status code of 200 or any other successful response, suggesting that the order was not actually accepted.

   User Journey:
   1) [Step 1] The user made an HTTP request (POST) to accept an order on the backend, indicating they intended to perform this action.
   2) [Step 2] The browser sent an OPTIONS request, which is a preflight check to ensure the server accepts the request method and headers. This suggests that the user may have been waiting for a response, but no successful response was received.
   3) [Step 3] The user clicked on the "Accept" button on the frontend, as indicated by the click event, but this action did not result in a subsequent HTTP request or response, suggesting that the order was not actually accepted.
   I have considered all the logs provided and made my decision based on the information available.
