 Tag: Drop-Off

   Reason: The user initiated a task (clicking on the "Menu" link to navigate to the menu page) but did not complete any other tasks that would indicate a conversion, such as scrolling through the menu items or clicking on an item to add it to their cart. Additionally, there is no evidence of the user completing any other tasks on the website after navigating to the menu page.

   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "Menu" link located at x=571, y=125.
   3) [Step 3] The user scrolled down the menu page to position y=81.
   4) [Step 4] The user did not interact with any other elements on the menu page or initiate any other tasks, such as clicking on a menu item or adding it to their cart.
   at the end Check if you considered all the logs: Yes, I have reviewed all the logs provided and have made my decision based on the initiated tasks and completion of those tasks. The user did not complete any tasks that would indicate a conversion, so I have classified this session as a drop-off.
