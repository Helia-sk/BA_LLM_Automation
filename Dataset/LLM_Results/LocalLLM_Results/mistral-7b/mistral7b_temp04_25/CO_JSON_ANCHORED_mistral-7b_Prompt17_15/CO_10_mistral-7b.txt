 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user initiated tasks by clicking on "Balance", but did not complete any of the subsequent tasks such as "View Details" or navigating to "Orders". This indicates that the user left the website without completing the intended action, which is a drop-off.

   User Journey Step-by-step:
   1) The user clicked on the "Balance" link (log with id log_1757774548389).
   2) The user did not initiate any further action, instead they clicked on the "Orders" link (log with id log_1757774552191), but this was not a subsequent task in the intended user journey.
   3) The user did not complete any other tasks that could be considered part of the intended user journey.

   All logs were considered in the decision making process, and it was determined that the session resulted in a drop-off as the user did not complete any initiated tasks.
