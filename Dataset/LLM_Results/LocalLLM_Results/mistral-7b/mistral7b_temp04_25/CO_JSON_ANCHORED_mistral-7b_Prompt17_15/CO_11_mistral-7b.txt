 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user did not complete any of the initiated tasks. While the session started with a scroll event on the dashboard page, there is no subsequent interaction that indicates completion of a task. For instance, clicking on a link to navigate to another page or performing an action like filling out a form or making a purchase.

   User Journey:
   1) [Step 1] The user started a session by visiting the customer dashboard (/customer/dashboard).
   2) [Step 2] The user scrolled through the dashboard page to various heights, indicating potential exploration of content on the page. However, no further action was taken to navigate to another page or interact with any elements on the dashboard page.
   3) [Step 3] The user continued scrolling on the dashboard page at different positions without performing any other actions.

   The user did not initiate any tasks beyond this point, and the session was eventually closed, making it a drop-off. It is essential to note that all logs were considered in this analysis.
