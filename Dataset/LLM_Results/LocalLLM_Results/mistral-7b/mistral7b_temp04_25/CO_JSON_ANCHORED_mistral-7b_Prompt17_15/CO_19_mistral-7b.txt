 Tag: Drop-Off

   Reason: The user initiated a task (clicking on "Customer Login") but did not complete it. Instead, they navigated away from the page without providing any information in the username field or password field, which indicates that they may have abandoned the login process.

   1) [Step 1] - User navigates to the restaurant dashboard settings page (indicated by the "page_view" event).
   2) [Step 2] - User clicks on the "Customer Login" link, initiating the login process (indicated by the "click" event).
   3) [Step 3] - User does not provide any information in the username or password fields and does not submit the form, indicating that they may have abandoned the login process (indicated by the subsequent "click" and "page_view" events).

   It is important to note that while the user did not complete the login process, we cannot definitively say whether they intended to return later or if their session was terminated. However, based on the provided logs, it appears that this session resulted in a drop-off.
