 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user initiated tasks such as clicking on "Menu", "ImageDrag image here or click to upload", and interacting with the form, but did not complete any of these tasks. This indicates that the session was not a conversion.

   1) [Step 1] User navigated to the restaurant dashboard page (http://localhost:5173/restaurant/dashboard/menu).
   2) [Step 2] User clicked on the "Menu" link.
   3) [Step 3] User interacted with the image upload area by clicking it.
   4) [Step 4] User clicked on the form containing the categories, name, description, price, and availability fields.
   5) [Step 5] User clicked on the SVG element (presumably an icon or button), but no further interactions were recorded after this step. This suggests that the user did not complete any of the tasks initiated in this session, hence it is classified as a drop-off.
