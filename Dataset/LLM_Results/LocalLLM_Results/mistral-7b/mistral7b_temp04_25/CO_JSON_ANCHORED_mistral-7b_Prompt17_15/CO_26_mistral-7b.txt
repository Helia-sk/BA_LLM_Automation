==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user initiated the task of adding an item to the menu, but did not complete it. This indicates that they abandoned the process before finalizing the action.

   1) [Step 1] The user accessed the restaurant's dashboard for managing the menu items.
   2) [Step 2] The user scrolled through the existing menu items and clicked on "Add Item".
   3) [Step 3] The user clicked on the area where they could upload an image or click to upload, but did not complete this action, indicating that they abandoned the process.
   4) [Step 4] The user clicked on other elements within the menu section, such as "Starters", "Main Courses", and "Desserts", but did not initiate any further tasks related to adding or editing these items.
   5) [Step 5] The user clicked on the "Mojito" item and then clicked on the svg element, but this does not seem to be directly related to the task of adding an item.
   I have considered all the logs provided, as there are no further actions that indicate a completion of the initiated task (adding an item). The user did not complete the task, so the session was a drop-off.
