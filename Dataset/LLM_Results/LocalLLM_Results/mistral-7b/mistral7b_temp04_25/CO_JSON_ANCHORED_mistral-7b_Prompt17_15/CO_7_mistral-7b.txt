==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user initiated a task (clicking on the "Customer Login" link) but did not complete it. Instead, the user clicked on the form and input field related to the login process, but no subsequent logs show the user entering any credentials or submitting the form, indicating that the login process was abandoned.

  1) [Step 1] User navigated to the homepage (not shown in log).
  2) [Step 2] User clicked on the "Customer Login" link.
  3) [Step 3] User interacted with the login form by clicking on the input field related to the username.
  4) [Step 4] User did not enter any credentials or submit the form, indicating that the login process was abandoned.

   The logs do not show any subsequent actions after step 4, so it is assumed that the user left the site without completing any further tasks.
