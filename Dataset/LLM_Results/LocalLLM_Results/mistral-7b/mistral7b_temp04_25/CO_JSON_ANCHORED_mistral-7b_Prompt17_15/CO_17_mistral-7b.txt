 Tag: Conversion
   Reason: All initiated tasks were completed. The user first clicked on "Restaurants" from the dashboard, then navigated to the "Restaurant" page (/customer/dashboard/restaurant), scrolled down, clicked on an image (presumably of a restaurant), and finally clicked the button labeled "Added to Cart", which indicates a successful addition of an item to the cart.

   User Journey:
   1) [Step 1] The user started the session by accessing the dashboard (/customer/dashboard).
   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "Restaurants" link located at x=394, y=128.
   3) [Step 3] The user navigated to the Restaurant page (/customer/dashboard/restaurant).
   4) [Step 4] The user scrolled down the page and clicked on an image (no specific coordinates provided, but it is assumed that this action was taken within the context of the page).
   5) [Step 5] The user initiated a conversion event by clicking the "Added to Cart" button. This action indicates that the user has completed their intended task for this session.
