 Tag: Conversion

   Reason: The user initiated the task of clicking on the "Customer Login" link, entered their username (indicated by the click and input events), typed in their password (not shown in the logs but implied by the focus event on the password field), and then clicked the "Sign in" button. Since all initiated tasks were completed, this session can be classified as a conversion.

   1) The user landed on the homepage ("http://localhost:5173/").
   2) The user clicked on the "Customer Login" link.
   3) The user's browser navigated to the login page ("http://localhost:5173/customer/login").
   4) The user clicked on the input field for username.
   5) The user entered their username (not shown in the logs but implied by the focus event).
   6) The user clicked on the input field for password.
   7) The user entered their password (not shown in the logs but implied by the focus event).
   8) The user clicked the "Sign in" button.
   9) The browser navigated to a new page, implying a successful login. However, since the logs do not show any further interactions, it is not possible to determine what happened next in this session.
