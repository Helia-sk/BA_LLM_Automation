   3) On the menu page, the user initiated the task of adding a new item by clicking on an input field for the item name.
   4) The user entered the item name ("Salad") and clicked outside the input field, indicating they were done entering the name.
   5) The user filled out the price for the item.
   6) The user initiated the task of adding the item by clicking on the "Add Item" button.
