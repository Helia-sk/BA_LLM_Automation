==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: One of the initiated tasks (View Details) was not completed, indicating that the user did not finish their intended action.

   1) [Step 1] The user navigated to the "restaurant/dashboard/history" page (log_1757835951066_df53zrrdx).
   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "History" link, which is a navigation element within the dashboard (log_1757835951066_9edj3bwaz).
   3) [Step 3] The user clicked on the "View Details" button, but did not complete this action, suggesting that they left the page or abandoned this specific task (log_1757835961979_hw4mtgead).
   4) [Step 4] The user interacted with two other buttons on the page (logs log_1757835963781_2e9f53t2n and log_1757835961979_hw4mtgead), but these do not appear to be part of the intended user journey, as they are not clearly associated with completing a task or moving forward in the process.
   5) [Step 5] The user closed the page by clicking on the "X" button (log_1757835963781_2e9f53t2n).
   I have considered all the logs provided, and based on the fact that one of the initiated tasks was not completed, I have classified this session as a drop-off.
