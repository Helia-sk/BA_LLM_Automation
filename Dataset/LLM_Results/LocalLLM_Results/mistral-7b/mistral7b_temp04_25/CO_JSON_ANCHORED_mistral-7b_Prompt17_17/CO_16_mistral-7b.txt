==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user initiated a task (clicking on the "Customer Login" link) but did not complete another task related to the login process. Specifically, they clicked on the username input field twice without entering any data and then navigated away from the page.

   1) [Step 1] User accessed the homepage ("http://localhost:5173/").
   2) [Step 2] User clicked on the "Customer Login" link located at x=1644, y=37.
   3) [Step 3] User clicked on the username input field without entering any data (click event with no corresponding debounce or change event).
   4) [Step 4] User clicked on the username input field again without entering any data (second click event).
   5) [Step 5] User navigated away from the page, as indicated by a new log entry not related to the session.

All initiated tasks were not completed, so the session was classified as a drop-off. It is important to note that this classification assumes that the goal of this session was for the user to successfully login, which may not always be the case depending on the specific application and goals.
