 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user initiated a task (clicking on the "Customer Login" link) but did not complete it by entering their username or password. Instead, they clicked away from the form and did not return to it, indicating that they abandoned the login process.

1) [Step 1] The user navigated to the homepage of the website (URL: http://localhost:5173/).
2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "Customer Login" link located at the top right corner of the page (x: 633, y: 35).
3) [Step 3] The user navigated to the login page (URL: http://localhost:5173/customer/login).
4) [Step 4] The user clicked on the username input field (x: 451, y: 310).
5) [Step 5] The user did not enter any text into the username input field.
6) [Step 6] The user clicked away from the form without entering their password or submitting the login.
7) [Step 7] The user did not take any further actions on the website, indicating that they abandoned the session.

I have considered all the logs in my decision making process and classified this session as a drop-off because the user initiated the login process but did not complete it by entering their username or password.
