 Tag: Conversion

   Reason: The user initiated two tasks (clicking on "Add Item" and then clicking within the menu items), and completed both of them. This indicates a successful interaction with the intended functionality, suggesting a conversion.

   1) [Step 1] The user navigated to the restaurant dashboard page ("http://localhost:5173/restaurant/dashboard/menu").
   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "Add Item" button, indicating an intention to add a new item.
   3) [Step 3] The user then interacted with the menu items (clicking on different options), suggesting they were adding or selecting items to be added.
   4) [Step 4] The user clicked on the "Saladmixvery healthy" option, indicating an intention to add this item.
   5) [Step 5] The user clicked on the "best dessert everSuper sweet" option, indicating another intention to add this item.
   6) [Step 6] The user clicked on the "Add Item" button again, presumably to confirm or submit their selections.
