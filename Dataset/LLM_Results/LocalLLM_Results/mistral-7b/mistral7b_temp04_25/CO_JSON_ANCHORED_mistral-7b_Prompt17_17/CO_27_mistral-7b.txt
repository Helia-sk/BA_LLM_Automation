==================================================

 Tag: Conversion
   Reason: All initiated tasks in the log file were completed. The user made a click event on the "Accept" button, which seems to be related to accepting an order in the backend logs. This action was followed by a successful HTTP response with status code 200 for the same endpoint ("orders.accept_order").

  1) [Step 1] The user initiated a request to accept an order from the backend (HTTP request event).
  2) [Step 2] The server responded with an options request, which is typically used to describe the capabilities and requirements of the server for the client. This was followed by another HTTP request to accept the order again, this time with content-type application/json.
  3) [Step 3] The server responded with a successful HTTP response (HTTP response event) for the second request, indicating that the order was successfully accepted.
  4) [Step 4] The user interacted with the frontend by clicking on the "Accept" button, which seems to be related to the backend operation of accepting an order. This action was recorded as a click event in the frontend logs.
  5) [Step 5] The user's browser made another HTTP request to the same endpoint ("orders.accept_order") from the backend, this time with content-type text/html; charset=utf-8. This could be a confirmation or update about the order acceptance.
  6) [Step 6] The server responded with another successful HTTP response (HTTP response event), indicating that the operation was completed successfully.

   All steps were completed, and no initiated tasks were abandoned, so the session can be classified as a conversion.
