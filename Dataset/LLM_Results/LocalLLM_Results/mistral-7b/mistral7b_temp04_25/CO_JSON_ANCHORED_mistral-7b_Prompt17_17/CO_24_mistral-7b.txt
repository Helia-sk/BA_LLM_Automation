==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: One of the initiated tasks (uploading an image for a menu item) was abandoned, as no further logs indicate completion of this task.

   1) [Step 1] The user navigated to the restaurant dashboard page ("http://localhost:5173/restaurant/dashboard/menu").
   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "Menu" link in the navigation bar.
   3) [Step 3] The user clicked on the "ImageDrag image here or click to upload" area within the form for adding a new menu item. This indicates initiation of the task to upload an image.
   4) [Step 4] No further logs indicate completion of the image upload task, suggesting that the user abandoned this task and possibly the entire process.
   Note: It's important to consider all logs before making a decision. In this case, even though the user initiated the form submission, no subsequent logs suggest completion of the form, which is another task in the user journey. This lack of completion also supports the classification as a drop-off.
