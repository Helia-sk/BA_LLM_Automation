==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user initiated a task (clicking on "Customer Login") but did not complete it. This suggests that the user left the page before completing the intended action, indicating a drop-off.

   User Journey Step-by-step:
   1) [Step 1] The user visited the homepage ("http://localhost:5173/").
   2) [Step 2] The user scrolled down the page to the "Customer Login" section.
   3) [Step 3] The user clicked on the "Customer Login" link, initiating a task. However, no further logs indicate that the user completed the login process, suggesting that the user left the page without completing the intended action.

   All initiated tasks were not completed, which aligns with the classification of this session as a drop-off. It's important to note that all logs were considered in this decision.
