 Tag: Conversion

   Reason: The user initiated a task (clicking on "Restaurants") and completed it by clicking on a specific restaurant ("No image available"). After that, the user clicked on another task ("Add to Cart"), which indicates an intention to purchase. Finally, the user completed the checkout process by clicking on "Checkout" and "Paid". Since all initiated tasks were completed, this session can be classified as a conversion.

   1) [Step 1] The user landed on the homepage (/customer/dashboard).
   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "Restaurants" link to navigate to the restaurants page.
   3) [Step 3] The user scrolled through the list of restaurants and clicked on a specific restaurant ("No image available").

   I have considered all the logs to the end, and there is no indication of any abandoned tasks or drop-offs in this session.
