 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user initiated tasks such as clicking on "Orders", "Balance", and "View Details" but did not complete any of them, instead closing the session by clicking on "Orders" and "Balance" again. This indicates that the user was exploring the website but did not engage in a task to completion, which is characteristic of a drop-off.

   User Journey:
   1) [Step 1] The user started the session by clicking on the "Cart" button.
   2) [Step 2] The user then clicked on the "Orders" link in the navigation bar.
   3) [Step 3] The user clicked on the "Balance" link in the navigation bar.
   4) [Step 4] The user clicked on the "View Details" button for one of the orders.
   5) [Step 5] The user did not complete any of the initiated tasks (viewing order details, checking balance), instead they clicked on "Orders" and "Balance" again before closing the session.
