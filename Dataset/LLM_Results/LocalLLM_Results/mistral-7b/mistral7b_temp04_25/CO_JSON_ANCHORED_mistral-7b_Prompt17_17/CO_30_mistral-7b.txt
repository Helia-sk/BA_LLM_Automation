 Tag: Drop-Off

   Reason: The user initiated a task (clicked on "History") but did not complete it by clicking on any of the subsequent options. Instead, they clicked on the "Reject" button, indicating that they decided to leave the page without completing their intended action.

   1) [Step 1] The user navigated to the restaurant dashboard page (http://localhost:5173/restaurant/dashboard).
   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "History" option, indicating an interest in viewing the history of orders or events.
   3) [Step 3] Instead of clicking on any specific item in the history list, the user clicked on the "Reject" button, which is typically used to decline or reject something. This action suggests that they decided to leave the page without further interaction.
   Note: All initiated tasks were not completed, hence the session was classified as a drop-off. It's important to consider all logs before making a decision to ensure accuracy.
