Consider every initiated task and both of the following conditions in your decision making. If all initiated tasks are completed → Tag: Conversion.

==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user initiated a task by navigating to the dashboard (log 10), but did not complete any other tasks that were initiated. Instead, they scrolled through the page multiple times without interacting with any other elements (logs 9,8,7). This suggests that the user was exploring the page but did not find what they were looking for or decided not to proceed with any actions.

   User Journey:
   1) [Step 1] The user started a new session by accessing the customer dashboard (log 10).
   2) [Step 2] The user scrolled down the page, reaching approximately halfway through the content (log 9).
   3) [Step 3] The user scrolled back to the top of the page and then continued scrolling down again (log 8).
   4) [Step 4] The user scrolled up to the top of the page once more, suggesting they were looking for specific information or features (log 7).
   However, there are no subsequent logs indicating that the user interacted with any other elements on the page. This indicates that the user did not complete any tasks and thus classifies this session as a drop-off.
