==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off

   Reason: The user initiated a task (clicking on the "Customer Login" link) but did not complete it. Instead, they clicked away from the login form without entering any credentials. This indicates that the user was not successful in completing the intended action (logging in as a customer).

   1) [Step 1] The user navigated to the restaurant's dashboard settings page (indicated by the "page_view" event with pathname "/restaurant/dashboard/settings").

   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the link to go to the customer login page, as indicated by the "click" event on the "A" tag with text "Customer Login".

   3) [Step 3] The user arrived at the customer login page, as indicated by the "page_view" event with pathname "/customer/login".

   4) [Step 4] The user clicked on the username input field, but did not enter any credentials or attempt to submit the form. This is indicated by the "click" event on the input element.

   5) [Step 5] The user clicked away from the login form without logging in, as indicated by the subsequent "page_view" event with pathname "/".

   It appears that all initiated tasks were not completed, so the session was a drop-off. The user did not log in as a customer and instead navigated back to the homepage.
