 Tag: Drop-Off

   Reason: The user initiated the task of clicking on the "Customer Login" link, but did not complete the subsequent tasks such as entering a username and password. Since one of the initiated tasks was abandoned, we classify this session as a drop-off.

   1) [Step 1] The user navigated to the homepage (URL: http://localhost:5173/).
   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "Customer Login" link located at x = 633, y = 35.
   3) [Step 3] The user clicked on the input field for username (x = 451, y = 310).
   4) [Step 4] The user did not enter any text in the username field.
   5) [Step 5] The user clicked outside of the username field (x = 433, y = 320).
   6) [Step 6] The user did not click on the password input field or enter a password.
   7) [Step 7] The session ended without submitting the login form.

   I have considered all the logs in my decision making and classification of this session as a drop-off since one of the initiated tasks was abandoned (entering a username).
