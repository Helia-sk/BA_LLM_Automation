 Tag: Conversion
   Reason: The user initiated the task of logging in by clicking on the "UsernamePasswordSign In" button, and then proceeded to click on both the username and password input fields, indicating that they intended to enter their credentials. After entering their information, they clicked on the submit button, which suggests a successful login.

   User Journey:
   1) The user clicked on the "Hungry?Order delicious food from local restaurants" link (indicating they were interested in the site), but this is not part of the login process so it will not be included in the journey.
   2) The user arrived at the login page.
   3) The user clicked on the "UsernamePasswordSign In" button to initiate the login process.
   4) The user clicked on the username input field and entered their username.
   5) The user clicked on the password input field and entered their password.
   6) The user clicked on the submit button, indicating a successful login.
   All initiated tasks were completed, so this session is classified as a conversion.
