==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user initiated a task by clicking on "History", but did not complete it by viewing the details of any specific item. Instead, they clicked on "Reject All" and then left the page. This indicates that the user did not find what they were looking for or were not satisfied with their experience, leading to a drop-off.

   User Journey:
   1) [Step 1] The user navigated to the restaurant dashboard page (/restaurant/dashboard).
   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "History" link located at x=676, y=126.
   3) [Step 3] The user was presented with a list of orders in the history section.
   4) [Step 4] Instead of clicking on any specific order to view its details, the user clicked on "Reject All".
   5) [Step 5] The user did not initiate any other tasks or navigate to any other pages, indicating that they left the application without completing their intended goal. This is considered a drop-off since the user did not complete the task of viewing the details of an order in the history section.
