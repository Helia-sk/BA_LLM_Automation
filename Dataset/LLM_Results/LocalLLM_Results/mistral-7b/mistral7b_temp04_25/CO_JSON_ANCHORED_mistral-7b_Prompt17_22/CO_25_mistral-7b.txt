==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user initiated a click event on the "Menu" link, but no further events related to completing tasks were recorded. This indicates that the user may have navigated away from the page without completing any of the intended tasks.

   User Journey:
   1) [Step 1] The user accessed the web application with version 1.4.2.
   2) [Step 2] The user scrolled down the page to a position 81 pixels from the top.
   3) [Step 3] The user clicked on the "Menu" link, indicating an interest in navigating to the menu section of the web application. However, no further events related to completing tasks were recorded, suggesting that the user may have left the page without interacting with the menu. This is consistent with a drop-off scenario as the intended task (navigating to and interacting with the menu) was not completed.
