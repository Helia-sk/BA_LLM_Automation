 Tag: Drop-Off

   Reason: Although the user initiated a login process, they did not complete it by entering any credentials. Instead, they clicked on the "Sign In" button without filling out the password field, which suggests that they may have abandoned the session before completing the intended task (logging in).

   1) [Step 1] The user navigated to the restaurant's login page ("/restaurant/login").
   2) [Step 2] The user entered their username (username_length: 0, but not shown in logs) and clicked on the "Sign In" button.
   3) [Step 3] The user did not fill out the password field, instead they clicked on the "Sign In" button again without entering any credentials.
   4) [Step 4] The user clicked away from the password input field, which triggered an "input_change" event with no new value entered (finalValueLength: 1, inputValue: "[HIDDEN]").
   5) [Step 5] No further actions were taken by the user in the provided logs, suggesting that they may have abandoned the session.

   Considering all the logs provided, it seems that the user did not complete any of the initiated tasks (logging in or navigating to the dashboard), so the session was a drop-off.
