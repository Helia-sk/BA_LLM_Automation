==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off

   Reason: The user initiated a task (clicking on the "Menu" link) but did not complete any other initiated tasks. Specifically, the user clicked on the "Menu" link at step 1, then clicked on an SVG element at step 2, and finally clicked on a form at step 3, but none of these subsequent clicks were followed by any completion event (such as submitting a form or uploading an image). Since one of the initiated tasks was abandoned, we classify this session as a drop-off.

   1) [Step 1] The user navigated to the restaurant dashboard menu page.
   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on an SVG element (likely for uploading an image).
   3) [Step 3] The user clicked on a form, but did not submit it or perform any other completion event.
   Note: We considered all the logs in our decision making and found that the user initiated tasks but did not complete them, hence classifying this session as a drop-off.
