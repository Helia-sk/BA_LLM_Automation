 Tag: Drop-Off

   Reason: The user initiated a task (clicking on "Customer Login") but did not complete it. Instead, they scrolled the page and then left the website without any further interaction that could be considered as a completed task.

   1) [Step 1] User accessed the homepage of the website ("http://localhost:5173/").
   2) [Step 2] User scrolled down the homepage to view its content.
   3) [Step 3] User clicked on the "Customer Login" button.
   4) [Step 4] User scrolled again, but this time they were at a different position on the page (scrollY: 139.1999969482422).
   5) [Step 5] User continued scrolling the page without any further interaction with the website ("Customer Login" form or other elements).
   6) [Step 6] User left the website by navigating away from it.

   It is important to note that all logs were analyzed and considered in this decision-making process. The user did not complete any of the initiated tasks, so the session was classified as a drop-off.
