==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user initiated a task (clicking on "History") but did not complete it by clicking on any of the subsequent buttons ("View Details", "X"). This indicates that the user abandoned the task, making this a drop-off session.

   User Journey:
   1) [Step 1] The user navigated to the restaurant dashboard page (route: "/restaurant/dashboard/history")
   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "History" link (log_1757835951066_df53zrrdx), indicating they intended to view the history.
   3) [Step 3] However, the user did not click on any of the subsequent buttons ("View Details", "X"), suggesting they abandoned the task of viewing or interacting with the history.
   It is important to note that the logs do not indicate any further actions from this user, so it can be assumed that the session ended at this point.
