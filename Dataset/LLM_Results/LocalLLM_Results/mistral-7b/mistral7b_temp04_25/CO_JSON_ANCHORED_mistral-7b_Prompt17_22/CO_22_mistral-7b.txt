==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user initiated the task of logging in to manage orders, but did not complete it. Instead, they clicked on the "Register your restaurant" link, which indicates a change in intent. This action was not followed by any subsequent steps that could be considered as completing the login process, so we classify this session as a drop-off.

   Here is the user journey step-by-step:
   1) The user clicked on the "Restaurant Partners" link.
   2) The user landed on the "/restaurant/login" page.
   3) The user initiated the task of logging in to manage orders by clicking on the login form input field for username.
   4) The user entered their username "User1".
   5) The user clicked on the login form input field for password, but did not enter any password.
   6) The user abandoned the login process and clicked on the "Register your restaurant" link instead.
   This session was a drop-off because the user initiated the task of logging in to manage orders, but did not complete it by entering their password or clicking the submit button. Instead, they changed their intent by clicking on the "Register your restaurant" link.
