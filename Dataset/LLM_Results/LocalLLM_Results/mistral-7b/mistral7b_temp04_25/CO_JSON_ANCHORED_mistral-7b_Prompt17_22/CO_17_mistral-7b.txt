 Tag: Conversion

   Reason: The user initiated two tasks (clicking on "Restaurants" and then scrolling down to view a restaurant's details) and completed both of them by clicking on the restaurant's name and subsequently clicking the "Add to Cart" button.

   1) [Step 1] The user landed on the customer dashboard page.
   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "Restaurants" link in the navigation menu.
   3) [Step 3] The user scrolled down the page to view a specific restaurant.
   4) [Step 4] The user clicked on the image of the restaurant, which did not have an image available, but this click action does not prevent the conversion as it was not a crucial step in the process.
   5) [Step 5] The user scrolled down further to view more details about the restaurant and clicked on the "Add to Cart" button.
   6) [Step 6] The user's session ended, indicating that they completed their intended action (adding a restaurant to their cart).

   All initiated tasks were completed, so the session was tagged as a conversion. The logs were considered in their entirety to make this decision.
