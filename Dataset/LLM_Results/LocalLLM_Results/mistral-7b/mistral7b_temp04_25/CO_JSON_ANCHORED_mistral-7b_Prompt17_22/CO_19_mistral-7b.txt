==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: One of the initiated tasks (Customer Login) was clicked but no further logs indicate that the user completed the subsequent task (entering username and password). Instead, there are logs indicating navigation away from the Customer Login page.

1) [Step 1] The user navigated to the restaurant dashboard settings page ("http://localhost:5173/restaurant/dashboard/settings").
2) [Step 2] The user then clicked on the "Customer Login" link located at x=1659, y=19.
3) [Step 3] The user clicked on a blank input field for username (x=910, y=309).
4) [Step 4] No further logs indicate that the user entered a username or password and submitted the form. Instead, there is a log indicating navigation away from the Customer Login page ("http://localhost:5173/"). This suggests that the user did not complete the login process and instead navigated elsewhere on the site, indicating a drop-off.

All logs have been considered in this analysis.
