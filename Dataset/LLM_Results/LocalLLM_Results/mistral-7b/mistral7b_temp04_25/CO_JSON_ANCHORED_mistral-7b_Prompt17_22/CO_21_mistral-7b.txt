 Tag: Conversion
   Reason: The user initiated two tasks (clicking on the "Restaurant Partners" link and then interacting with the username input field) and completed both of them, indicating a successful session.
   1) [Step 1] The user navigated to the homepage ("/") from the restaurant dashboard.
   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "Restaurant Partners" link, which initiated the task of registering or logging in.
   3) [Step 3] The user then clicked on the username input field, which is typically associated with logging in, suggesting that they intended to log in rather than register a new restaurant.
   However, since the logs do not provide information about the completion of the login process, it's impossible to confirm whether the user successfully logged in or abandoned the task. Nonetheless, based on the completed tasks, this session can be classified as a conversion.
