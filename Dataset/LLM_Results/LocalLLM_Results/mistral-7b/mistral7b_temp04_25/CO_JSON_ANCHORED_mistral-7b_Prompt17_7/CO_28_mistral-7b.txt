 Tag: Drop-Off

   Reason: Although the user initiated a form submission, they did not complete it, as indicated by the "form_submit" event. However, since there are subsequent events after the form submission (such as an input change event), it suggests that the user may have encountered issues or decided to abandon the form.

   1) [Step 1] The user visited the login page of the restaurant website ("http://localhost:5173/restaurant/login").
   2) [Step 2] The user entered their username (indicated by a "form_submit" event, but no username length is provided).
   3) [Step 3] The user entered their password (indicated by an "input_change" event for the password field).
   4) [Step 4] The user clicked the "Sign In" button to submit their login details (indicated by a "click" event). However, they did not complete the form submission.
   5) [Step 5] The user made another input change in the password field (indicated by another "input_change" event), suggesting they may have attempted to correct an error or reconsidered their action.
   Since the form submission was not completed, the session can be classified as a drop-off. It's important to note that this analysis is based on the provided logs and does not consider any additional context or user behavior outside of these events.
