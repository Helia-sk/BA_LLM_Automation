 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user initiated a task (clicking on "Menu") but did not complete any of the subsequent tasks. Specifically, they clicked on the "ImageDrag image here or click to upload" area, but no further actions related to uploading an image were logged. This suggests that the user may have abandoned the process of adding or editing a menu item.

  1) The user navigated to the restaurant dashboard (URL: http://localhost:5173/restaurant/dashboard/menu).
  2) The user clicked on the "Menu" link (URL: http://localhost:5173/restaurant/dashboard/menu).
  3) The user viewed the form for adding or editing a menu item.
  4) The user clicked on the area where an image could be uploaded ("ImageDrag image here or click to upload").
  5) No further actions related to uploading an image were logged, suggesting that the user may have abandoned the process.

All initiated tasks were considered in this analysis. The user did not complete any of the tasks, so the session was classified as a drop-off.
