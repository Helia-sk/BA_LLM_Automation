 Tag: Drop-Off

   Reason: The user initiated the task of clicking on the "Customer Login" link (Log 7), but did not complete the subsequent tasks related to entering a username and password. Instead, the user left the page after clicking on the username input field (Log 5) and the password input field (Log 4).

   1) [Step 1] The user visited the homepage of the website (implied from the context).

   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "Customer Login" link, which initiated the login process.

   3) [Step 3] The user navigated to the login page and clicked on the username input field, but did not enter any username or password.

   4) [Step 4] The user left the page by clicking away from the login form, indicating that they did not complete the login process.

   I have considered all the logs in my decision-making process. The user initiated the task of logging in but did not complete it, which is why I classified this session as a drop-off.
