 Tag: Conversion
   Reason: All initiated tasks were completed. The user clicked on the "Restaurant Login" link, then clicked on the username input field, entered the username "User1", and finally clicked on the password input field (although no password was entered in this log). Since all these steps were taken, it is considered a conversion.

   User Journey:
   1) The user clicked on the "Restaurant Login" link to initiate the login process.
   2) The user clicked on the username input field to enter their credentials.
   3) The user entered the username "User1".
   4) The user clicked on the password input field (although no password was entered in this log). This step is implied as it is a necessary part of the login process.

   All the logs provided were considered. The user initiated the login process, completed entering their username, and attempted to enter their password, indicating that they intended to complete the login process. Since all steps were taken, it is considered a conversion.
