==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: Not all initiated tasks were completed. The user clicked on the "Customer Login" link, which initiated a session, but did not complete the login process by entering their username and password. Instead, they clicked on the input field for the username, but did not type anything in it or click the submit button.

   User Journey:
   1) [Step 1] The user navigated to the "Customer Login" page by clicking on the corresponding link.
   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the input field for the username, but did not type anything in it or click the submit button, suggesting they intended to enter their username but abandoned the task.
   [The user's actions indicate a drop-off as they did not complete the login process.]
