==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user initiated a task (clicking on "History") but did not complete it by clicking on any of the subsequent options ("View Details", "X"). Instead, they closed the session by clicking on another option ("X"). This indicates that the user did not complete their intended action, which is a characteristic of a drop-off.

  1) [Step 1] The user accessed the restaurant dashboard page.
  2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "History" link to view the history.
  3) [Step 3] The user clicked on the "X" button, which closed the session without further interaction with any of the options related to viewing details or completing an action within the history section.

   All initiated tasks were not completed, and one of them was abandoned (the click on "History"), which supports the classification as a drop-off. The user did not complete their intended action (viewing the history details), indicating that they left the session without engaging further.
