==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user initiated a task (scrolling through the page) but did not complete it. After scrolling to different parts of the page, the user clicked on a link to navigate to "/customer/dashboard", but there is no subsequent log indicating that they continued with another task or returned to the same page.

  1) [Step 1] The user started a session by visiting the homepage ("/customer/dashboard").
  2) [Step 2] The user scrolled through the page multiple times, but did not interact with any clickable elements other than scrolling.
  3) [Step 3] The user clicked on a link to navigate to "/customer/dashboard", but there is no subsequent log indicating that they continued with another task or returned to the same page.

   I have considered all the logs provided, and based on the absence of any completed tasks after the initial scrolling and navigation, I have classified this session as a drop-off.
