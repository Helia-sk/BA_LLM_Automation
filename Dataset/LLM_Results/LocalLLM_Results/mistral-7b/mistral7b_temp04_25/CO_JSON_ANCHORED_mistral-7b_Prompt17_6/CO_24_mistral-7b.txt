==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off

   Reason: One of the initiated tasks (uploading an image for a menu item) was abandoned, as there is no subsequent log indicating that it was completed.

   1) [Step 1] The user navigated to the restaurant dashboard page (/restaurant/dashboard/menu).
   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "ImageDrag image here or click to upload" area in the form, indicating an intent to add a new menu item.
   3) [Step 3] The user clicked on the SVG icon, which is likely intended for uploading an image, but there is no subsequent log suggesting that an image was successfully uploaded.
   4) [Step 4] The user clicked on various other elements within the form, such as the "Save Changes" and "Cancel" buttons, but did not complete any of the required fields (Name, Description, Price, Category, Available for order).
   5) [Step 5] The user left the page without performing any actions that would indicate a completed task.

   It is important to note that while the user did interact with various elements on the page, none of these interactions resulted in the completion of a task (uploading and saving a new menu item). Therefore, based on the provided logs, this session can be classified as a drop-off.
