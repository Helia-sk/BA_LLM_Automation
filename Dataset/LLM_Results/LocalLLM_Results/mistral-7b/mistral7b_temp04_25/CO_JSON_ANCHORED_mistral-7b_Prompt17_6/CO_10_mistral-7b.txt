 Tag: Conversion

   Reason: The user initiated tasks by clicking on "Balance", then "Orders", and finally "View Details" for an order. After that, the user clicked on "Orders" again, which indicates they were navigating through their orders. However, since no further actions related to abandoning the session were observed after this, we can consider it a conversion as all initiated tasks were completed.

   1) The user started by clicking on the "Balance" link (indicating they wanted to check their balance).
   2) Next, they clicked on the "Orders" link, indicating they wanted to view their order history.
   3) They then clicked on the "View Details" button for one of their orders, suggesting they were interested in checking the details of that specific order.
   4) The user again clicked on the "Orders" link, possibly to navigate through their order history or check other details. No further actions related to abandoning the session were observed after this, indicating a possible completion of their intended tasks.
