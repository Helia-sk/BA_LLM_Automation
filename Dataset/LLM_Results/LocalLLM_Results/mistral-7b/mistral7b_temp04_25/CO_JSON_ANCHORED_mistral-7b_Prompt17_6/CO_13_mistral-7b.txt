 Tag: Drop-Off

   Reason: The user initiated a task (clicking on "History") but did not complete it by clicking on the subsequent button ("View Details"). This indicates that the user abandoned the task, thus classifying this session as a drop-off.

   1) [Step 1] The user accessed the restaurant dashboard page.
   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "History" link to view the history.
   3) [Step 3] The user did not click on the "View Details" button for any of the history items, indicating that they left the page without completing their intended action.

   I have considered all the logs provided in this response. The user's interaction with the system suggests a drop-off as they initiated a task (viewing history) but did not complete it by clicking on the "View Details" button.
