==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: One of the initiated tasks (entering username and password) was abandoned, as no logs indicate that the user completed these steps.

   1) [Step 1] The user navigated to the Customer Login page by clicking on the "Customer Login" button.
   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the Username input field.
   3) [Step 3] The user clicked outside of the username input field without entering any text.
   4) [Step 4] The user clicked on the Password input field but did not enter any password.
   5) [Step 5] The user did not submit the form, indicating that they abandoned the login process.
   Note: Although the user initially navigated to the Customer Login page and performed some actions, they did not complete all the initiated tasks (entering username and password), so this session is classified as a drop-off.
