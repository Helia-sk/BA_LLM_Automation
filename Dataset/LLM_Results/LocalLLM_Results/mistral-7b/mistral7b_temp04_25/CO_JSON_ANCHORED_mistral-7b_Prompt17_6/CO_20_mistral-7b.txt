==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user initiated tasks (clicking on the "Sign In" button and filling out the username and password fields) but did not complete the final task (submitting the form). This suggests that the user left the page before completing the sign-in process, indicating a drop-off.

  1) [Step 1] The user visited the login page of the website.
  2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "Sign In" button to initiate the sign-in process.
  3) [Step 3] The user clicked on the username field and then clicked on it again, suggesting that they intended to enter their username. However, no data was entered.
  4) [Step 4] The user clicked on the password field and then clicked on it again, suggesting that they intended to enter their password. However, no data was entered.
  5) [Step 5] The user did not submit the form, indicating that they left the page before completing the sign-in process.
  6) [Step 6] The user clicked on a link promoting food ordering, but this does not affect the classification of the session as it is not part of the sign-in process.

   It's important to note that all logs were considered in this analysis. The user initiated the sign-in process but did not complete it, which indicates a drop-off.
