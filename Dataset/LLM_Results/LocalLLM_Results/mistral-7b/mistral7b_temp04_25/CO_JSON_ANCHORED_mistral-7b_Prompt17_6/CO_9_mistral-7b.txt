==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: Although the user initially visited a restaurant page (indicating an initiated task), they did not complete any further tasks such as scrolling down to view more content, clicking on any other elements like images, or navigating to another page. This indicates that the session was abandoned, hence it is classified as a drop-off.

   User Journey:
   1) [Step 1] The user initiated a session by visiting the customer dashboard.
   2) [Step 2] The user navigated to a specific restaurant page (restaurant/4).
   3) [Step 3] The user scrolled down the page to the image section but did not click on it.
   4) [Step 4] The user scrolled back up and then scrolled the page again, indicating they were reviewing the content. However, this was the last interaction recorded in the log file, suggesting that the user did not complete any further tasks or navigate to another page.
   Note: It is important to consider all logs when making a decision. In this case, since no further interactions after visiting the restaurant page were recorded, it is reasonable to classify the session as a drop-off.
