==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: One of the initiated tasks (Add Item) was abandoned, as there is no subsequent log indicating completion of this task.

   1) [Step 1] The user navigated to the restaurant's dashboard menu page (/restaurant/dashboard/menu).
   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "Add Item" button, initiating the process of adding a new item to the menu.
   3) [Step 3] The user clicked on the area where menu items are displayed, but this action did not result in any further logs related to the completion of the "Add Item" task.
   4) [Step 4] The user interacted with various elements on the page, such as dragging and clicking images and text, but these interactions do not seem to be directly related to the "Add Item" task.
   5) [Step 5] The user clicked on an SVG element without any subsequent logs indicating completion of this action or any other initiated tasks.
   It appears that all logs have been considered in this analysis, and based on the condition that if all initiated tasks are completed → Tag: Conversion, it can be seen that one of the initiated tasks (Add Item) was abandoned, leading to a classification of Drop-Off.
