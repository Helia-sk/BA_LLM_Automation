 Tag: Conversion

   Reason: The user initiated a click on the "Customer Login" link, which was followed by a click on the "Already have an account? Sign in" button. After that, the user interacted with the username input field and password input field, indicating they were attempting to log in. Since all initiated tasks (clicking the login link, clicking the sign-in button, and entering their credentials) were completed, this session can be classified as a conversion.
