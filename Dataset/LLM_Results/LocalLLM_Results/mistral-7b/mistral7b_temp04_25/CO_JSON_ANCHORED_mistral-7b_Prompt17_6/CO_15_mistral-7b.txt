 Tag: Conversion

   Reason: The user initiated a task (clicking on the "Customer Login" button) and completed it by successfully entering their username and password in the login form. This is evident from the logs showing the click event on the "Customer Login" button, followed by a series of click events within the login form, and finally a successful navigation to the dashboard page (indicated by the "page_view" log).

   1) The user navigated to the homepage ("/") from another page ("/restaurant/dashboard/settings").
   2) The user clicked on the "Customer Login" button.
   3) The user entered their username and password in the login form.
   4) The user successfully logged in, as indicated by the subsequent logs showing the click events within the login form being replaced with logs related to the dashboard page interactions.

   All the initiated tasks (navigation to the homepage and clicking on the "Customer Login" button) were completed, hence the session was a conversion. The user journey can be summarized as follows: User navigated to the homepage -> Clicked on the "Customer Login" button -> Entered username and password -> Successfully logged in. All logs were considered in this analysis.
