 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user initiated the task of clicking on the "Customer Login" link, but did not complete the subsequent steps such as entering a username and password. This indicates that the user abandoned the process before completing it.

   User Journey:
   1) [Step 1] The user navigated to the homepage of the website.
   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "Customer Login" link located at the top right corner of the page.
   3) [Step 3] The user clicked on the username input field, but did not enter any information.
   4) [Step 4] The user did not click on the password input field or submit the form.
   5) [Step 5] The user did not perform any other actions that would indicate a conversion, such as adding items to a cart or making a purchase.
   It is important to note that while the user did not complete all initiated tasks, it is still valuable to analyze the logs to identify potential issues or areas for improvement in the user experience. For example, the user may have found the login process confusing or difficult to navigate, leading to abandonment.
