==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user initiated tasks (clicking on the "Register your restaurant or log in to manage orders" link and filling out the username field) but did not complete the task by clicking the submit button for the password field. This indicates that the user abandoned the session before completing all initiated tasks.

   User Journey:
   1) The user navigated to the Restaurant Partners login page (log_1758985133183_qr0zt2rti).
   2) The user clicked on the "Register your restaurant or log in to manage orders" link, which took them to the login form (log_1758985133860_4znr19nye).
   3) The user filled out the username field with the value "User1" (log_1758985133183_ivi9skey6 and log_1758985135389_wenesuzwe).
   4) The user did not fill out or submit the password field, indicating that they abandoned the session (no corresponding logs found for this step).

   All logs have been considered in the decision-making process.
