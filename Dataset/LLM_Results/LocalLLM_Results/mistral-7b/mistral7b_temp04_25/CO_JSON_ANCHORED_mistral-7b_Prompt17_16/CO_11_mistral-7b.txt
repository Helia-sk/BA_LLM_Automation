==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user did not complete the intended task (visiting the specific restaurant page and placing an order). The logs show that the user visited the dashboard, scrolled through the list of restaurants, clicked on a restaurant, but then left without returning to the restaurant page or initiating an order.

  1) [Step 1] User opens the application (indicated by the first log entry with the URL "/customer/dashboard").
  2) [Step 2] User scrolls through the list of restaurants (indicated by multiple "scroll" events).
  3) [Step 3] User clicks on a specific restaurant (indicated by the log entry with "url": "http://localhost:5173/restaurant/[restaurant_id]"). However, there is no subsequent log entry indicating that the user returned to the restaurant page or initiated an order.
  4) [Step 4] User leaves the application (indicated by the last log entry with no URL and "url": null).

   It appears that all logs have been considered in this analysis. The user did not complete the intended task, which was to visit a specific restaurant page and place an order, so the session is classified as a drop-off.
