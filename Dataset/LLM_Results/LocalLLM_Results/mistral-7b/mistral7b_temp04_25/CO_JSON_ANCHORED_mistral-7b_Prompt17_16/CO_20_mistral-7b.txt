 Tag: Drop-Off

   Reason: The user initiated the task of logging in by clicking on the "Username Password Sign In" button, but did not complete it. Instead, they clicked on a link to explore food options, indicating that they may have left the login process incomplete.

   1) [Step 1] User landed on the homepage. They saw a call-to-action ("Hungry? Order delicious food from local restaurants") and decided to click on it.
   2) [Step 2] User clicked on the "Username Password Sign In" button, indicating they wanted to log in.
   3) [Step 3] Instead of completing the login process, user navigated away from the login page by clicking on a link that took them to a different part of the site (exploring food options). This suggests that the session was a drop-off as the initiated task (logging in) was not completed.
