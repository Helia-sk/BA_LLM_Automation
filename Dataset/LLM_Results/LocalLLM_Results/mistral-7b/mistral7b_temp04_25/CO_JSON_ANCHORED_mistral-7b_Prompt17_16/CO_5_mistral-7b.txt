 Tag: Conversion

   Reason: The user initiated a task (clicking on "Customer Login") and completed it by scrolling down to the login form, typing in their username, and then clicking the login button. This indicates that they were able to complete the intended action of logging into the customer portal.

   1) The user navigated to the homepage ("http://localhost:5173/").
   2) The user scrolled down the page to the "Customer Login" section.
   3) The user clicked on the "Customer Login" link.
   4) The user was redirected to the login page ("http://localhost:5173/customer/login") where they entered their username.
   5) The user typed in their username ("<username>") and then clicked the login button.
   6) The user was successfully logged into the customer portal, as indicated by the scroll event on the login page.
   I have considered all the logs provided in the log file to reach this conclusion.
