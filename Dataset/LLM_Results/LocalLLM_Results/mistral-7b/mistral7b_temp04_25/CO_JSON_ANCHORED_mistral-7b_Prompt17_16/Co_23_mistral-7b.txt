==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user clicked on the "Settings" link, which initiated a task. However, the subsequent logs show that the user did not complete any of the other tasks related to adding an item (clicking on the "Add" button and entering information into the input field). Therefore, since one of the initiated tasks was abandoned, we classify this session as a drop-off.

   User Journey:
   1) [Step 1] The user navigated to the restaurant dashboard page.
   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "Settings" link, initiating a task.
   3) [Step 3] The user did not complete any other tasks related to adding an item (clicking on the "Add" button and entering information into the input field).
   Since one of the initiated tasks was abandoned, we classify this session as a drop-off.
