 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user initiated a task (clicked on "Customer Login") but did not complete it, instead navigating away from the page. This indicates that the session was dropped off.

   1) [Step 1] User navigated to the restaurant dashboard settings page at http://localhost:5173/restaurant/dashboard/settings.
   2) [Step 2] User clicked on the "Customer Login" link, indicating an intention to start a new task (customer login).
   3) [Step 3] User navigated away from the customer login page at http://localhost:5173/customer/login without completing the task.
   4) [Step 4] User navigated back to the homepage at http://localhost:5173/. This suggests that the user might have intended to return to the customer login page, but the log file does not contain further information to confirm this. However, since the original task (customer login) was not completed, the session is classified as a drop-off.

The analysis is based on the initiated task (customer login) and the fact that it was not completed in the provided logs.
