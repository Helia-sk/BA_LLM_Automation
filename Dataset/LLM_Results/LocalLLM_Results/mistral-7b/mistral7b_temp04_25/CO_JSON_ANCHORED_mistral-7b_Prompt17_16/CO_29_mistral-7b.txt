   Reason: All initiated tasks in the session were completed. The user clicked on the "History" link, then clicked on a history item to view details, and finally closed the details window by clicking the "X" button. After that, the user returned to the history page and clicked the "View Details" button again for another history item.

   1) The user started on the dashboard page.
   2) The user clicked on the "History" link.
   3) The user clicked on a history item to view details.
   4) The user closed the details window by clicking the "X" button.
   5) The user returned to the history page and clicked the "View Details" button again for another history item.

   I have considered all the logs in the session, as they provide a clear sequence of actions indicating that the user initiated and completed all tasks presented during this session.
