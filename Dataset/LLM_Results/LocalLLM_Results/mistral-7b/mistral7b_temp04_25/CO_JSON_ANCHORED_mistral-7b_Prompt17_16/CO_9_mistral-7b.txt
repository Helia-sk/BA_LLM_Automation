 Tag: Conversion

   Reason: The user initiated a task (scrolling down the page) and completed it, indicating they were engaged with the content. They then clicked on an element ("No image available"), which could be considered as interacting with the restaurant's details, another task. Although there is no explicit evidence of completing a conversion action like placing an order or booking a table, the user's interaction suggests that they may have been exploring the restaurant's details further, which can be interpreted as a sign of engagement and potential intent to convert in future interactions.

   1) [Step 1] The user visited the dashboard page (http://localhost:5173/customer/dashboard).
   2) [Step 2] The user scrolled down the page, indicating they were exploring the content.
   3) [Step 3] The user scrolled to a specific restaurant's details and did not interact with any elements for a while (log at 2025-09-13T14:32:58.718Z).
   4) [Step 4] The user scrolled further down the page, suggesting they were still exploring the content (log at 2025-09-13T14:32:58.615Z).
   5) [Step 5] The user clicked on an element within the restaurant's details ("No image available"), indicating interest in the restaurant's details.
   6) [Step 6] The user continued scrolling down the page, suggesting they were still engaging with the content (log at 2025-09-13T14:32:57.591Z). This could indicate further exploration of other restaurants or details on the page.
   7) [Step 7] The user session ended, but without any evidence of a conversion action like placing an order or booking a table, it's unclear if this was the end of their interaction or if they simply moved to another part of the site to complete the conversion process. However, based on their engagement with the content, it can be inferred that they were potentially interested in the service.
