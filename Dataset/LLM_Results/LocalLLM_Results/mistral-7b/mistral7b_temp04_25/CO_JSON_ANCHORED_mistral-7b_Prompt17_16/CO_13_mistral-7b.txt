==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user initiated a task (clicked on "History") but did not complete it by clicking on any of the subsequent options like "View Details". Instead, they clicked on the "X" button which can be interpreted as an attempt to close or exit the page. This indicates that the user abandoned the task before completing it.

  1) [Step 1] The user navigated to the restaurant dashboard history page ("/restaurant/dashboard/history").
  2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "History" link to view the history of orders.
  3) [Step 3] The user did not click on any of the order details to view them, instead they clicked on the "X" button which is usually used for closing a window or exiting a page. This suggests that the user left the page without completing the intended action (viewing the order details).
  4) [Step 4] The session ended as the user did not interact with any other elements on the page after clicking the "X" button, indicating a drop-off.

   All initiated tasks were not completed, hence the tag is Drop-Off. It's important to consider all logs to the end to make an informed decision.
