==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user initiated a login process but did not complete it, as indicated by the "form_submit" event. However, they continued to interact with the page, such as clicking on buttons and changing input values, which suggests that they may have been exploring or experiencing issues with the form. However, since the login process was not completed, we cannot classify this session as a conversion.

   User Journey:
   1) [Step 1] The user navigated to the restaurant's website (URL not provided in logs).
   2) [Step 2] The user initiated the login process by clicking the "Sign In" button.
   3) [Step 3] The user entered their credentials into the username and password fields.
   4) [Step 4] The user clicked the "Sign In" button again, initiating a form submission. However, they did not complete the login process.
   5) [Step 5] The user continued to interact with the page, clicking on buttons and changing input values, but did not complete any other tasks that would indicate a successful login or further engagement with the site.
   Since the login process was not completed, we cannot definitively say what the user's next steps might have been. However, based on their continued interaction with the page, it seems likely they may have encountered issues or decided to leave the site without logging in.
