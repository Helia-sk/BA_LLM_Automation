==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user initiated a task (clicked on "History") but did not complete it by clicking on the subsequent button ("View Details"). This indicates that the user abandoned the task.

   1) [Step 1] The user navigated to the restaurant dashboard page (/restaurant/dashboard).
   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "History" link, indicating an interest in viewing the history of the restaurant.
   3) [Step 3] The user did not click on the "View Details" button for any of the history entries, suggesting that they did not find the desired information or decided to leave the page without further interaction.
   4) [Step 4] The user clicked on the "Reject" button, indicating a decision to abandon the current session.

I have considered all the logs in my analysis and classification. The user initiated a task (clicking on "History") but did not complete it, which is indicative of a drop-off.
