 Tag: Drop-Off

   Reason: The user initiated a task (clicking on the "Menu" link) but did not complete it. They clicked on multiple items within the menu form, but no submission was recorded. This indicates that the user did not successfully add, save changes, or place an order, which are all tasks associated with a conversion in this context.

   1) [Step 1] The user accessed the restaurant dashboard at "http://localhost:5173/restaurant/dashboard".
   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "Menu" link located at x=586, y=124.
   3) [Step 3] The user hovered over an image drag area (x=889, y=695), but did not interact with it.
   4) [Step 4] The user clicked on the "ImageDrag" svg element located at x=664, y=338, but no further action was recorded related to this click.
   5) [Step 5] The user clicked on various input fields within the menu form (image area, category, name, description, price, and availability), but no submission was recorded.
   6) [Step 6] The user's session ended without any further interaction.

   It is important to note that all logs have been considered in this decision-making process. The user initiated a task (clicking on the "Menu" link), but did not complete it, which classifies this session as a drop-off.
