 Tag: Conversion

   Reason: The user initiated the login process by clicking on the "Username" field and then entered their username. After that, they clicked on the "Password" field and entered their password. Finally, they clicked on the "Sign In" button to submit their login details. Since all the initiated tasks were completed, this session can be classified as a conversion.

   1) The user landed on the homepage (URL: http://localhost:5173/customer/login).
   2) The user clicked on the "Username" field to initiate entering their username.
   3) The user entered their username in the "Username" field.
   4) The user clicked on the "Password" field to initiate entering their password.
   5) The user entered their password in the "Password" field.
   6) The user clicked on the "Sign In" button to submit their login details.
   7) The user clicked on a link saying "Hungry? Order delicious food from local restaurants", but this action is not directly related to the login process, so it doesn't affect the conversion status.
   8) The system processed the login request and (assuming the credentials were correct), allowed the user to access their account, completing the session as a conversion.
