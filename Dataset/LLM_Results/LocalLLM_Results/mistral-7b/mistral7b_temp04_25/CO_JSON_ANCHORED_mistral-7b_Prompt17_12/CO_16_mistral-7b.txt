==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user initiated a task (clicking on "Customer Login") but did not complete another task related to the login process (entering username and password). This indicates that the user abandoned the session before completing all initiated tasks.

   User Journey Step-by-step:
   1) [Step 1] The user navigated to the website (URL not specified in the logs, but it's assumed as the starting point).
   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "Customer Login" link located at x=1644, y=37.
   3) [Step 3] The user clicked on the username input field (x=824, y=295), but did not enter any username.
   4) [Step 4] The user clicked on the password input field (same coordinates as the username field), but did not enter any password.
   5) [Step 5] No further actions related to the login process were recorded in the logs, indicating that the user abandoned the session.

   All the logged events were considered in the decision making process. The user initiated a task (login) but did not complete it, hence the session is classified as a drop-off.
