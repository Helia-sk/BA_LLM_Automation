 Tag: Drop-Off

   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "History" link located at x = 676, y = 126.
   3) [Step 3] The user did not click on any of the options within the history section, instead they clicked on the "Reject" button located at x = 1538, y = 298. This action indicates that they decided to leave without completing their intended action (viewing the details of a specific order or transaction).
   Note: The user did not complete any other tasks initiated during this session. Therefore, based on the conditions provided, this session can be classified as a drop-off.
