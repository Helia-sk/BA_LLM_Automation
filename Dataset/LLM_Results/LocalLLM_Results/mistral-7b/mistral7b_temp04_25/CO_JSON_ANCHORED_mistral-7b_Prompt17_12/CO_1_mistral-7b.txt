 Tag: Drop-Off

   Reason: The user initiated the task of clicking on the "Customer Login" link, but did not complete the subsequent tasks of entering a username and password. This indicates that the user abandoned the session before completing the login process.

   1) [Step 1] The user visited the homepage (URL: http://localhost:5173/).
   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "Customer Login" link located at x = 604, y = 17.
   3) [Step 3] The user navigated to the login page (URL: http://localhost:5173/customer/login).
   4) [Step 4] The user clicked on the username input field but did not enter any text, indicating that they might have intended to enter a username. However, this action was not followed by any further actions related to entering a password or submitting the form, suggesting that the user abandoned the session.
   5) [Step 5] The user clicked on the username input field again, but this action was also not followed by any further actions related to entering a password or submitting the form, confirming that the user abandoned the session.
   Note: I have considered all the logs provided in the log file for my decision making. The user did not complete all initiated tasks (entering a username and password), so the session was classified as a drop-off.
