 Tag: Conversion
   Reason: The user initiated a click on the "Restaurant PartnersRegister your restaurant or log in to manage orders" link, which led them to the login page. After that, the user clicked on the username input field and then typed something into it (indicating they are attempting to enter their username). This was followed by clicking on the password input field and typing something there as well (indicating they are attempting to enter their password). Finally, the user clicked the "Log In" button. While we cannot confirm whether the login was successful or not, the fact that the user initiated all these actions suggests they were attempting to complete the login process, which is one of the tasks required for a conversion.

  1) The user navigated to the homepage (http://localhost:5173/).
