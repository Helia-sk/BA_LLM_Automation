 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user initiated a task (scrolling down the page) but did not complete it, indicating potential interest in the content but ultimately abandoning the session. This is evident in the logs as the user scrolled down the page twice and then stopped interacting with the application.

   1) [Step 1] The user visited the homepage ("http://localhost:5173/customer/dashboard").
   2) [Step 2] The user scrolled down the page to view a restaurant (indicated by the "scroll" event).
   3) [Step 3] The user clicked on an image within the restaurant listing, but no further interaction was recorded.
   4) [Step 4] The user then scrolled down the page again, suggesting they might have been looking for more content or information about the restaurant.
   5) [Step 5] After this second scroll event, there were no subsequent interactions, indicating that the user dropped off without completing any tasks or initiating any other actions within the application.
