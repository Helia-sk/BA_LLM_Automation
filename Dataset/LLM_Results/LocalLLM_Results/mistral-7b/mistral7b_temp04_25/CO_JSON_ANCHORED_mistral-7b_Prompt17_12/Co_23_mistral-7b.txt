 Tag: Conversion

   Reason: The user initiated a task (clicking on "Settings") and then completed another task (interacted with the input field, clicked "Add", entered information into the input field, and clicked "Submit"). Since all initiated tasks were completed, this session can be classified as a conversion.

   1) [Step 1] The user navigated to the restaurant dashboard page.

   4) [Step 4] The user clicked the "Add" button.
   5) [Step 5] The user entered information into the input field.
