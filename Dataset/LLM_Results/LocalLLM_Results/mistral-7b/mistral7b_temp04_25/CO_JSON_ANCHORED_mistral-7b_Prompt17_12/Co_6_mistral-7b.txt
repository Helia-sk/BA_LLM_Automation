 Tag: Drop-Off

   Reason: The user initiated the task of navigating to the "Customer Login" page (log 9), but did not complete the subsequent tasks such as entering a username and password, which are necessary for a conversion. Instead, the user clicked on an input field for the username (log 7) and an input field for the password (not present in the logs), but did not enter any information. The user also clicked on the username input field again (log 6), suggesting that they may have been trying to correct a mistake or reconsider their action, but ultimately did not proceed with the login process.
