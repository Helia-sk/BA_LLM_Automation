 Tag: Conversion

   Reason: All initiated tasks were completed. The user made a click event on the "Accept" button, which corresponds to the acceptance of an order in the backend logs. This action was followed by successful HTTP responses from the backend with status codes 200, indicating that the order was accepted successfully. No abandoned tasks or events were observed.

   6) The user clicked on the "Accept" button on the frontend dashboard, indicating that they acknowledge the acceptance of the order (frontend log).
