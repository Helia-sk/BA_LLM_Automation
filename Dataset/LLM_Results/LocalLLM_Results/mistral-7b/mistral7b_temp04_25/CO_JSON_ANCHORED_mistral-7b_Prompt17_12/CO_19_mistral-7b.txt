==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user initiated a task (clicking on "Customer Login") but did not complete it. Instead, they navigated away from the page without performing any other actions that could be considered as part of the conversion flow.

  1) [Step 1] User navigated from the restaurant dashboard settings to the customer login page by clicking on the "Customer Login" link.
  2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the username input field, but did not enter any information or perform any other actions related to the login process.
  3) [Step 3] The user navigated away from the customer login page, as indicated by a new page view event for the homepage.

The logs provided do not show any subsequent actions that could be considered part of the conversion flow (e.g., entering correct credentials, clicking on submit button, or accessing a protected customer area). Therefore, based on the initiated and abandoned tasks, this session can be classified as a drop-off. It is essential to consider all logs to make an accurate decision.
