 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user initiated tasks by clicking on "Balance" and then "Orders", but did not complete any of those tasks. Instead, they clicked on "Orders" again and then clicked on "View Details", which suggests that the user might have been looking for more information about their orders, but did not proceed further. After that, the user closed the session by clicking on "X" (implied from no further actions).

  1) [Step 1] The user logged in to their account.
  2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "Balance" tab to check their balance.
  3) [Step 3] The user decided not to view their balance and instead clicked on the "Orders" tab.
  4) [Step 4] The user viewed their orders but did not take any further action, such as clicking on an order to see more details or making a purchase.
  5) [Step 5] The user clicked on "Orders" again, possibly to recheck something.
  6) [Step 6] The user clicked on "View Details" for one of their orders but did not proceed further.
  7) [Step 7] The user closed the session by clicking on "X".

   All initiated tasks were not completed, so the session was a drop-off. It's important to note that the user might have faced issues or found the interface confusing, which led to their drop-off. Further analysis and improvements can be made based on this information to enhance the user experience.
