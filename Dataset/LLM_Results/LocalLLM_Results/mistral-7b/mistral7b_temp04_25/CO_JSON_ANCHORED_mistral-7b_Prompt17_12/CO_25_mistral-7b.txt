 Tag: Drop-Off

   Reason: The user initiated a task (clicking on the "Menu" link) but did not complete it, as indicated by the subsequent scroll and click events that were not followed by any further interaction related to the menu items. The session ended without any further interaction with the menu page or any other part of the application.

   1) [Step 1] User accessed the restaurant dashboard page (url: http://localhost:5173/restaurant/dashboard/menu).
   2) [Step 2] User clicked on the "Menu" link (id: log_1758985428126_s76qbxnch, class name: flex items-center px-3 py-2 rounded-md text-sm font-medium whitespace-nowrap bg-orange-500 text-white).
   3) [Step 3] User scrolled down the page (id: log_1758985431599_ioqmc3uaa, class name: scroll).
   4) [Step 4] User clicked on an SVG element (id: log_1758985435886_4l55g8a0y, class name: svg).

   The user did not complete any task related to the menu items and left the page without further interaction. Therefore, this session was classified as a drop-off. It is important to note that all logs were considered in making this decision.
