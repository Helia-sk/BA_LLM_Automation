 Tag: Conversion

   Reason: The user initiated two tasks (clicking on the "Restaurant Partners" link and then entering their username), and completed both of those tasks by clicking on the "Register your restaurant or log in to manage orders" button and providing a username.

   1) [Step 1] The user navigated to the homepage ("/") from another page ("http://localhost:5173/restaurant/dashboard").
   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "Restaurant Partners" link, which led them to the login/registration page for restaurants.
   3) [Step 3] The user then clicked on the "Register your restaurant or log in to manage orders" button, indicating they wanted to register a new restaurant.
   4) [Step 4] The user entered their username and completed the registration process.

   All initiated tasks were completed, so this session is considered a conversion. I have reviewed all the logs provided to ensure that no steps were missed or overlooked in my decision making.
