 Tag: Conversion
   Reason: The user initiated a form submission (log 5), which is one of the tasks, and completed it by providing values in both the username and password fields. Although there are other logs showing clicks and input changes, they do not represent tasks that need to be completed for a conversion.

   User Journey:
   1) [Step 1] The user navigated to the restaurant login page (log 8).
   2) [Step 2] The user entered their username in the username field (not shown in logs, but implied by log 9 where the password is entered and the username field is not empty).
   3) [Step 3] The user entered their password in the password field (log 6).
   4) [Step 4] The user clicked the "Sign In" button (log 7), initiating a form submission.
   5) [Step 5] The user completed the form submission by providing valid credentials (log 5).
   After reviewing all logs, I considered every initiated task and found that they were all completed, which indicates a conversion.
