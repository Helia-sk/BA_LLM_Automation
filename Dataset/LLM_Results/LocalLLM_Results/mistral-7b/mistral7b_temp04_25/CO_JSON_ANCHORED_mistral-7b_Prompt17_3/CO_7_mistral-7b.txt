 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user initiated a task (clicking on the "Customer Login" link) but did not complete it. Instead, they clicked on the form and the input field for username, but there is no subsequent log indicating that they entered their username or password and submitted the form.

   1) [Step 1] The user navigated to the homepage of the website (indicated by the first log).
   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "Customer Login" link, which initiated a task (indicated by the fifth log).
   3) [Step 3] The user clicked on the form for username input, but there is no subsequent log indicating that they entered their username or password and submitted the form. This suggests that the user abandoned the task of logging in.
   Note: All logs were considered to make this decision. The user did not complete all initiated tasks (logging in), so the session was classified as a drop-off.
