==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user initiated a task (clicking on the "Restaurant Login" link) but did not complete it. Instead, they clicked on the "Already have an account? Sign in" button, which is not part of the intended login process. This suggests that the user may have been confused or intending to perform a different action.

  1) [Step 1] The user navigated to the Restaurant Login page (indicated by the "Restaurant Login" click event).
  2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "Already have an account? Sign in" button, which is not part of the intended login process.
  3) [Step 3] The user did not perform any further actions related to the login process.

I have considered all the logs provided, and there are no subsequent events that indicate a successful login or completion of the intended task. Therefore, I classify this session as a drop-off.
