 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: One of the initiated tasks was abandoned. The user clicked on the "View Details" button (initiated task), but there are no subsequent logs indicating that this action was completed, suggesting that the user may have left the page without finishing the intended action.

   1) [Step 1] The user accessed the restaurant dashboard history page ("History" link click).
   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on a button labeled "View Details". This represents an initiated task, but there is no subsequent log indicating that this action was completed.
   3) [Step 3] No further actions were observed in the provided logs, suggesting that the user may have left the page without finishing any other intended actions.
   Check: All the provided logs were considered for the decision-making process. The absence of subsequent logs after the "View Details" button click indicates a potential drop-off. However, it's important to note that additional information might be required to confirm this classification definitively (e.g., user behavior on other pages or sessions).
