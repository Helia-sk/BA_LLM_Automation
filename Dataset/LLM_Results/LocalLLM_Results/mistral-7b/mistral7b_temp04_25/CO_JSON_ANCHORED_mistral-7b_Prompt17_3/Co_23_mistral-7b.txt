   1) [Step 1] The user navigated to the restaurant dashboard page.
   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "Settings" link located at x = 831, y = 135.
   3) [Step 3] The user clicked on the "Add" button located at x = 821, y = 632.
   4) [Step 4] The user filled out the form to add something with the input field located at x = 824, y = 619.
   5) [Step 5] The user submitted the form by clicking on the "Add" button located at the same position as in step 3 (x = 821, y = 632).
   All initiated tasks were completed, so this session is tagged as a conversion.
