==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off

   Reason: The user initiated the task of clicking on the "Customer Login" link, but did not complete the subsequent tasks related to entering a username and password. Instead, they navigated away from the page before completing these steps.

   1) [Step 1] The user visited the homepage ("http://localhost:5173/").
   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "Customer Login" link located at x = 1644, y = 37.
   3) [Step 3] The user navigated to the login page ("http://localhost:5173/customer/login").
   4) [Step 4] The user clicked on the username input field but did not enter any data and left the page without completing the login process.

   I have considered all the logs provided, as they cover the user's interaction with the website from the homepage to the login page, but the user did not complete the login process, which meets the criteria for a drop-off.
