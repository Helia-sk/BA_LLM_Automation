==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: One of the initiated tasks (View Details) was not completed, indicating that the user did not finish their intended action.

   1) [Step 1] The user navigated to the restaurant dashboard page at http://localhost:5173/restaurant/dashboard. This is the starting point of the user's journey.
   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "History" link, indicating that they wanted to view the history of the restaurant.
   3) [Step 3] Upon reaching the History page, the user clicked on a specific item to View Details but did not complete this action. This suggests that the user may have found the details uninteresting or decided to leave without further interaction.
   [Note: The user also clicked on the "Reject" button but this is not considered as it was not an initiated task]
   [Final Note: All logs were reviewed, and no additional information was provided that could change the classification from Drop-Off to Conversion]
