==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: Not all initiated tasks were completed. The user clicked on the "Customer Login" link, but did not complete the login process as indicated by the subsequent logs showing clicks and interactions with the login form, but no corresponding "click.v1" event indicating a successful login submission.

   User Journey:
   1) [Step 1] The user navigated to the homepage of the website.
   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "Customer Login" link located at the top right corner of the page.
   3) [Step 3] The user was redirected to the login page where they clicked on the login form input field.
   4) [Step 4] The user clicked on the login form again, but did not complete the login process as indicated by the lack of a corresponding "click.v1" event for the login submission button.
   5) [Step 5] The user interacted with other elements on the login page such as the password input field and the "Forgot Password" link, but did not complete the login process.
   It appears that the user did not complete all initiated tasks, so the session was a drop-off.
