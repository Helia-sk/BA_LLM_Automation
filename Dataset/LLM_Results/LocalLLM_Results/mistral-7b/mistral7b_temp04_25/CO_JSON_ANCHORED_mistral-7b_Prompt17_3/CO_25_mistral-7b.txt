==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user initiated a task (clicking on the "Menu" link to navigate to the menu page) but did not complete any other tasks related to interacting with the menu items or submitting any form. Instead, the user scrolled and clicked on an SVG element, which does not seem to be part of the intended user journey for a conversion.

  1) [Step 1] The user accessed the restaurant dashboard page (URL: http://localhost:5173/restaurant/dashboard/menu).
  2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "Menu" link located at x=571, y=125.
  3) [Step 3] The user scrolled down the page to y=81.
  4) [Step 4] The user scrolled further down the page to y=588 and clicked on an SVG element at x=1134, y=588.

   It is important to note that all logs were considered in this decision-making process. The user did not complete any tasks related to interacting with the menu items or submitting a form, which indicates a drop-off.
