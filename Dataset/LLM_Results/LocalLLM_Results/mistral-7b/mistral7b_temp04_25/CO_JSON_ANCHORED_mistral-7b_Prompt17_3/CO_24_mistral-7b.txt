 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: Although the user initiated several tasks such as clicking on the "Menu", "ImageDrag image here or click to upload", and scrolling through various categories, they did not complete any of these tasks. Specifically, they did not upload an image, nor did they fill out a form for any category (Starters, Main Courses, Desserts, Drinks, Side Dishes). Therefore, based on the condition that if all initiated tasks are completed, the session is tagged as Conversion, and since one of the initiated tasks was abandoned, the session is classified as Drop-Off.
