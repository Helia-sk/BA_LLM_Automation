==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user initiated a task (scrolling down on the dashboard page) but did not complete it, as indicated by multiple scroll events without any other interactions that would suggest completion of a task. However, since more logs need to be analyzed to confirm if all initiated tasks were abandoned, this is a tentative conclusion.

   Let's break down the user journey:
   1) [Step 1] The user started a session by navigating to the customer dashboard (/customer/dashboard).
   2) [Step 2] The user scrolled down the page, but did not interact with any other elements.
   3) [Step 3] The user continued scrolling further down the page without engaging in any other activities.
   4) [Step 4] The user scrolled back up to a certain point on the page.
   5) [Step 5] The user scrolled down again, but this time only to a slightly lower position than before.
   6) [Step 6] The user scrolled back up once more, indicating potential interest in returning to a previous position on the page.
   However, without further interaction or navigation, we cannot definitively classify this session as a conversion. More logs are needed to confirm if all initiated tasks were completed or abandoned.
