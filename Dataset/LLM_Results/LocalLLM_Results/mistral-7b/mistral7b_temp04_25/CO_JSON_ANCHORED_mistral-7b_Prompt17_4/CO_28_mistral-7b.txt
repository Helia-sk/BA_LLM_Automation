==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off

   Reason: The user initiated a login process (form_submit event) but did not complete any subsequent tasks such as clicking the "Sign In" button or entering a password. This indicates that the user abandoned the session without completing it.

   1) [Step 1] The user visited the restaurant's website (URL: http://localhost:5173/restaurant/).

   2) [Step 2] The user navigated to the login page (URL: http://localhost:5173/restaurant/login).

   3) [Step 3] The user entered their username or email address in the username field but did not enter a password.

   4) [Step 4] The user clicked the "Sign In" button to initiate the login process. However, they did not complete the process by entering a password or clicking any other buttons related to the login process.

   Note: Although the user clicked the "Sign In" button again after entering their username, this does not change the fact that they did not complete the login process. The second click on the "Sign In" button can be considered as a repetitive action or a mistake by the user.

   Since the user initiated a task (login) but did not complete it, the session is classified as a drop-off. All the logs were considered in this decision.
