 Tag: Conversion

   Reason: All initiated tasks were completed. The user clicked on the "Add Item" button, which indicates an attempt to add a new item to the menu. This action was followed by clicking on the specific item categories (Starters, Main Courses, Desserts, Drinks, Side Dishes) and dragging an image for one of the items. Finally, the user clicked on the "Drag image here or click to upload" area, suggesting that they successfully added a new item to the menu.
