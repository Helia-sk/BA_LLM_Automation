==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user initiated tasks (clicking on the "Restaurant Partners" link and filling out the username field), but did not complete the task of entering a password, which is indicated by the absence of a log entry for the password input change event.

   1) [Step 1] The user navigated to the restaurant login page ("/restaurant/login") by clicking on the "Restaurant Partners" link.
   2) [Step 2] The user entered their username ("User1") in the username input field.
   3) [Step 3] The user clicked on the username input field, indicating they were about to enter a password, but there is no log entry for this event, suggesting that they did not complete this step.
   [Note: There are no subsequent logs indicating any further interaction with the page or the site, which further supports the classification of this session as a drop-off.]
