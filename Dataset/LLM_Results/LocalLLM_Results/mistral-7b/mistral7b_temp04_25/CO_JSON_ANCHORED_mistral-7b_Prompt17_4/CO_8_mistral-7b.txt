 Tag: Drop-Off

   Reason: The user initiated the task of clicking on the "Customer Login" link, but did not complete the subsequent tasks such as entering a username and password. This indicates that the user abandoned the process before completing it, hence classifying this session as a drop-off.

   1) [Step 1] The user navigated to the homepage of the website (URL: http://localhost:5173/).
   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "Customer Login" link located at the top right corner of the page.
   3) [Step 3] The user clicked on the username input field, indicating that they were about to enter their username. However, no further logs show that a username was actually entered.
   4) [Step 4] The user did not interact with any other elements on the page, such as the password input field or the login button.
   5) [Step 5] The session ended without any further interaction from the user.

   It is important to note that all logs were considered in this analysis. The user initiated the task of logging in but did not complete it, which meets the criteria for a drop-off.
