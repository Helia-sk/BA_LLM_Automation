 Tag: Drop-Off

   Reason: The user initiated a task (clicking on the "Customer Login" link) but did not complete it, as indicated by the subsequent logs showing clicks on the username and password input fields, but no further interaction suggesting login submission.

   1) [Step 1] User navigates to the homepage ("http://localhost:5173/").
   2) [Step 2] User clicks on the "Customer Login" link located at x=633, y=35.
   3) [Step 3] User clicks on the username input field (x=451, y=310).
   4) [Step 4] User clicks on the password input field (x=433, y=320).
   However, there is no subsequent log showing a click or interaction suggesting login submission, indicating that the user did not complete the task of logging in.

   The logs provided do not indicate any further actions taken by the user, so it cannot be determined if there were any other initiated tasks abandoned or completed. Therefore, it's important to consider all logs before making a final decision.
