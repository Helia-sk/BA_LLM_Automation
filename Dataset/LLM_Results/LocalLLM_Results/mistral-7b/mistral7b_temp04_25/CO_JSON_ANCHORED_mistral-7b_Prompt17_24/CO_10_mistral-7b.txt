 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user initiated tasks by clicking on "Balance", then "Orders", but did not complete any of these tasks. Instead, they clicked on "View Details" under Orders and eventually clicked on "Orders" again, which indicates confusion or dissatisfaction with the initial click. After that, the user closed the session by clicking on "X" (implicitly logged out).

  1) The user accessed the customer dashboard. [Reason: This is the start of the session.]
  2) The user clicked on the "Balance" link. [Reason: The user wanted to check their balance.]
  3) The user clicked on the "Orders" link. [Reason: After not finding the balance information, the user decided to check their orders instead.]
  4) The user clicked on the "View Details" button under Orders. [Reason: The user wanted more information about their orders.]
  5) The user clicked on the "Orders" link again. [Reason: The user might have been confused or dissatisfied with the information provided in the order details.]
  6) The user closed the session by clicking on "X". [Reason: The user did not complete any initiated tasks, indicating a drop-off.]

   In this log file, all initiated tasks were abandoned, so the session was classified as a drop-off. It is essential to consider every log in the analysis to ensure an accurate decision.
