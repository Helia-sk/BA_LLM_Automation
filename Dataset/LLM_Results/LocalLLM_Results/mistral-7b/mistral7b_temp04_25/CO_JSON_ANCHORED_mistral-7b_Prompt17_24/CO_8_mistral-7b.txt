==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user initiated the task of logging in as a customer, but did not complete the process by entering their username or password. This indicates that they abandoned the login process before completing it, which is considered a drop-off.

   User Journey Step-by-step:
   1) [Step 1] The user navigated to the Customer Login page on the website (log with id "log_1757773780414_vgl8l6n2s").
   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "Username" field on the login form (log with id "log_1757773797385_uwv7j47ib").
   3) [Step 3] The user clicked on the "Username" field again (log with id "log_1757773797833_std7mojhy"). This suggests that the user may have been trying to interact with the field, but did not enter any text.
   4) [Step 4] The user did not perform any further actions related to the login process, indicating that they abandoned the session (no subsequent logs related to entering a password or submitting the form were found).
