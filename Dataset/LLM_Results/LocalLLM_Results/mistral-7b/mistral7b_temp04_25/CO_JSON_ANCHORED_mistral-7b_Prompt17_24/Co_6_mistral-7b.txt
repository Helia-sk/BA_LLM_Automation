 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user clicked on the "Customer Login" link, which initiated a session. However, the user did not complete any of the subsequent tasks such as filling out the username and password fields or submitting the form. This indicates that the user abandoned the session before completing all initiated tasks.

   User Journey:
   1) [Step 1] The user navigated to the "/customer/login" page by clicking on the "Customer Login" link.
   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the username input field, indicating that they were about to enter their username.
   3) [Step 3] The user did not enter any text in the username field and instead clicked outside of it, which suggests they may have decided to abandon the login process at this point.
   4) [Step 4] The user clicked on the password input field, but again did not enter any text, indicating that they were not going to proceed with the login.
   5) [Step 5] The user did not submit the form, suggesting that they have abandoned the session without completing the login process.
