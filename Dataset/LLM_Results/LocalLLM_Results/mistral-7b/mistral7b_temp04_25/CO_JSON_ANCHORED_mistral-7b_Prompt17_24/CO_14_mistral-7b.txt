 Tag: Conversion

   Reason: The user initiated the task of navigating to the customer login page (log 10), clicked on the username input field (logs 9, 18), entered a username (logs 16, 17), and then clicked on the password input field (logs 20, 21). After that, the user entered a password (logs 24, 25) and finally clicked on the login button (log 30). Since all initiated tasks were completed, this session can be classified as a conversion.

   1) The user navigated to the customer login page (log 10).
   2) The user clicked on the username input field (logs 9, 18).
   3) The user entered a username (logs 16, 17).
   4) The user clicked on the password input field (logs 20, 21).
   5) The user entered a password (logs 24, 25).
   6) The user clicked on the login button (log 30).

   I have considered all the logs in my decision making. The user initiated the task of logging in and completed it by providing both the username and password, and clicking on the login button. Therefore, this session can be classified as a conversion.
