 Tag: Drop-Off

   Reason: The user initiated a click event on the "Menu" link, but did not complete any other tasks that could be considered as conversion events. After the click event, there are no subsequent events indicating further interaction with the application, such as form submissions or navigation to different pages.

   1) [Step 1] The user accessed the web application (web-1.4.2) on a Windows system.
   2) [Step 2] The user scrolled down the page to position (81, 0).
   3) [Step 3] The user clicked on the "Menu" link located at position (571, 125).
   4) [Step 4] No further interaction was recorded, indicating that the user did not complete any other tasks.

   Note: All logs were considered in this analysis. The absence of conversion events and the completion of only one initiated task suggest a drop-off session.
