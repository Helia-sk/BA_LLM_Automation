 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user initiated the task of logging in to manage orders, but did not complete it. Instead, they clicked on the "Register your restaurant" link, which suggests that they may have been a new user intending to register rather than log in. However, since we do not have information about whether the registration process was completed or not, we cannot confirm if this was the intended action or an abandonment of the original task.

  1) [Step 1] The user navigated to the restaurant partner's login page (indicated by log_1758985133183).
  2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the username input field, indicating they intended to enter their username (log_1758985133860).
  3) [Step 3] The user clicked away from the username input field, suggesting they may have been intending to enter a password. However, no log indicates a click on the password input field or a submission of the login form (logs _1758985135389 and following logs do not indicate a login attempt).
  4) [Step 4] The user clicked on the "Register your restaurant" link (log_1758985133183), which is not part of the intended task flow for logging in. This suggests that the user may have been a new user intending to register rather than log in, or they may have abandoned the login process.

   Since the user did not complete the intended task (logging in to manage orders) and instead initiated an action outside of the expected task flow, we classify this session as a drop-off. However, it's important to note that additional information about the registration process could change this classification if the user completed the registration process.
