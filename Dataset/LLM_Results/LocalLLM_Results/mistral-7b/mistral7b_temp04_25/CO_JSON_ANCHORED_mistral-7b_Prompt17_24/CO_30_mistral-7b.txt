 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user did not complete all initiated tasks. Although the user navigated to the "History" page, they did not click on any of the details, nor did they view any specific detail. Instead, they returned to the dashboard and eventually closed the session by rejecting a detail view.

  1) [Step 1] The user initiated a session by landing on the restaurant dashboard.
  2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "History" link in the dashboard navigation, indicating an interest in viewing past orders or events.
  3) [Step 3] Upon reaching the "History" page, the user did not interact with any of the listed details, instead choosing to return to the dashboard.
  4) [Step 4] The user rejected a detail view by clicking the 'Reject' button, signaling their intention to close the session without completing any tasks related to the history section.

   It is essential to consider all logs in the decision-making process to ensure accuracy and avoid making assumptions or guesses. In this case, since the user did not complete any initiated tasks, the session can be classified as a drop-off.
