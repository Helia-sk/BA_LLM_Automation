==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user initiated tasks such as clicking on "History", "View Details", and "X" (which might have been to close a popup or dialog), but did not complete the final task of "Add to Cart" or "Checkout". This indicates that the session was abandoned before a conversion occurred.

   User Journey:
   1) [Step 1] The user visited the restaurant dashboard page.
   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "History" link in the navigation menu.
   3) [Step 3] The user clicked on a specific history item to view its details.
   4) [Step 4] The user clicked on the "X" button, which might have closed a popup or dialog without taking any further action. This indicates that the user did not proceed with adding an item to the cart or checking out.
   Note: All logs were considered in this analysis. The user initiated tasks but did not complete the conversion process, hence the session was classified as a drop-off.
