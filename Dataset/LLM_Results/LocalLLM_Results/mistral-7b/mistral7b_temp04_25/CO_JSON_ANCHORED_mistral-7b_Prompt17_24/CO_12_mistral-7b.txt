 Tag: Conversion

   Reason: The user initiated two tasks (clicking on the "Menu" link and then clicking the "Add Item" button), both of which were completed. Therefore, this session can be classified as a conversion.

   1) [Step 1] The user navigated to the restaurant's dashboard page by clicking the "Menu" link.
   2) [Step 2] The user then clicked on the "Add Item" button, indicating an intention to add an item to the menu.
   3) [Step 3] Since no further logs suggest any abandonment of this task, it can be inferred that the user successfully added an item to the menu, completing their intended action. This session can thus be classified as a conversion.
