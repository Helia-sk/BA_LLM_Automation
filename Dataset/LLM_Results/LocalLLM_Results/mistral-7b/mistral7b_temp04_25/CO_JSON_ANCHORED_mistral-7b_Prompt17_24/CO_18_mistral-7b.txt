==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user clicked on the "Restaurant PartnersRegister your restaurant or log in to manage orders" link, indicating an intent to register or log in. However, the subsequent logs show that the user did not complete any of the initiated tasks related to registration or login. Instead, the user clicked on the username and password fields, but no input was provided, and the form was not submitted.

   User Journey:
   1) [Step 1] The user navigated to the restaurant partners' login page (indicated by the first log).
   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the username field (log with id "log_1758983087916_loj1igqdu").
   3) [Step 3] The user clicked on the password field (log with id "log_1758983087706_po7bjncib").
   4) [Step 4] The user did not provide any input in the username or password fields and did not submit the form (no logs indicate submission).
   5) [Step 5] The user clicked on a link to register or log in, which was outside the intended flow of the login process (log with id "log_1758983087044_u5c4t1nnc").
   Since the user did not complete any of the initiated tasks (login or registration), this session is classified as a drop-off.
