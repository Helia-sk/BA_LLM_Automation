==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: One of the initiated tasks (clicking on the "Customer Login" button) was not completed, indicating that the user did not proceed with the login process.

   1) [Step 1] The user navigated to the homepage ("/") from the restaurant dashboard settings page at 2025-09-27T14:18:55.683Z.
   2) [Step 2] At 2025-09-27T14:19:05.841Z, the user clicked on the "Customer Login" link, initiating the login process.
   3) [Step 3] The user then clicked on the username input field at 2025-09-27T14:19:06.939Z, but no further actions related to the login process were recorded in the log file.
   4) [Step 4] At 2025-09-27T14:19:45.841Z, the user clicked on an element with an empty id field, which might have been a navigation link or a form submit button, but no corresponding event was recorded in the log file.
   5) [Step 5] The last action recorded in the log file is a page view at 2025-09-27T14:19:55.683Z, indicating that the user remained on the homepage without performing any further actions related to the login process or initiating other tasks.
   I have considered all the logs in my analysis, and based on the information provided, it appears that the session was a drop-off as one of the initiated tasks (customer login) was abandoned.
