 Tag: Drop-Off

   Reason: Although the user initiated the task of clicking on the "Customer Login" link, they did not complete the subsequent tasks such as entering a username and password. This indicates that the session was abandoned before completion.

   1) [Step 1] The user navigated to the homepage ("http://localhost:5173/").
   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "Customer Login" link located at x=633, y=35.
   3) [Step 3] The user clicked on the username input field (x=451, y=310).
   4) [Step 4] The user did not enter any text into the username input field.
   5) [Step 5] The user clicked outside of the form (x=433, y=320), suggesting they may have intended to enter a password but abandoned the session.
   6) [Step 6] No further interactions were recorded in this log file, indicating that the user did not complete the login process or any other tasks on the page.

   It is important to note that while the user clicked on the username input field and the form itself, they did not actually perform the intended task of entering a username and password. Therefore, based on the initiated but uncompleted tasks, this session can be classified as a drop-off.
