==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user initiated a task (scrolling down to the dashboard page) but did not complete it, as indicated by subsequent scroll events without any additional interaction. However, since we have not been provided with information about other potential tasks that might constitute a conversion, we cannot definitively confirm if all initiated tasks were completed or abandoned.

   User Journey:
   1) [Step 1] The user started a new session and navigated to the customer dashboard page (indicated by log_1757774276450).
   2) [Step 2] The user scrolled down the page, but did not interact with any other elements (log_1757774275386, log_1757774274528). This could indicate that they were browsing or reading the content on the page.
   3) [Step 3] The user continued scrolling down the page (log_1757774274528), but again, did not interact with any other elements, suggesting that they may have lost interest or left the page without completing any tasks.
   Further logs would be needed to confirm if all initiated tasks were completed or abandoned, and thus classify this session as a conversion or drop-off.
