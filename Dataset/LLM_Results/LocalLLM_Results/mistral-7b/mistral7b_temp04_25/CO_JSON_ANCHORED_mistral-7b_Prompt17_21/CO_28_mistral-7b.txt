 Tag: Drop-Off

   Reason: The user initiated a login process by entering their credentials (form_submit event), but did not complete any further tasks such as clicking the "Sign In" button or navigating to the dashboard page. This indicates that the user abandoned the session after logging in, which is considered a drop-off.

   1) [Step 1] The user visited the restaurant's webpage (URL: http://localhost:5173/restaurant/).
   2) [Step 2] The user navigated to the login page (URL: http://localhost:5173/restaurant/login).
   3) [Step 3] The user entered their username and password in the respective fields.
   4) [Step 4] The user submitted the login form (form_submit event), but did not click the "Sign In" button or navigate to any other page, indicating that they abandoned the session after logging in.

   I have considered all the logs provided and made a decision based on the initiated tasks and whether they were completed or abandoned. The user initiated the login process but did not complete it, which is a drop-off.
