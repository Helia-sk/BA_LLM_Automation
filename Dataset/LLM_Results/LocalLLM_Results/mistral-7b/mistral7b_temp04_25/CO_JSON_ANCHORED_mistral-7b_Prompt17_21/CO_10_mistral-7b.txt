==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off

   Reason: The user initiated tasks by clicking on "Balance", then "Orders", but did not complete any of those tasks. Instead, they clicked on "View Details" under Orders, but there is no subsequent log indicating that they completed viewing the details or made a purchase. Finally, the user clicked on "Orders" again and then "Cart", but there are no further logs suggesting a completion of this task either. Since all initiated tasks were abandoned, the session can be classified as a drop-off.

   1) The user started by accessing the customer dashboard.
   2) Clicked on the "Balance" tab to check their account balance.
   3) Then, they navigated to the "Orders" tab to view their order history.
   4) After that, they clicked on "View Details" under one of the orders, but there's no further log to confirm if they actually viewed the details or not.
   5) The user revisited the "Orders" tab again.
   6) They also clicked on the "Cart" tab, but there are no subsequent logs indicating a completion of this task (e.g., adding an item to the cart, proceeding to checkout).
   Considered all the logs to the end, and based on the absence of any completed tasks, the session was classified as a drop-off.
