 Tag: Conversion

   Reason: The user initiated two tasks (navigating to the Restaurants page and selecting a specific restaurant) and completed both of them, indicating a successful interaction with the application.

   1) [Step 1] The user started the session on the Customer Dashboard.
   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "Restaurants" link to navigate to the Restaurants page.
   3) [Step 3] After viewing the restaurants, the user selected a specific restaurant by clicking on it.
   4) [Step 4] The user interacted with the image of the selected restaurant (indicated by the click event).
   5) [Step 5] The user clicked on the "Add to Cart" button for the selected restaurant, indicating an intention to purchase.
   6) [Step 6] The user scrolled down the page to view more details about the selected restaurant, but no further actions were recorded in the log file, suggesting that the user may have completed their intended interaction (placing the order or continuing to browse).

   It should be noted that while the log file does not contain information about the user's final action, the completion of all initiated tasks indicates a successful session and a possible conversion. However, it is essential to consider that additional data might be needed to confirm the conversion, such as whether the user completed their purchase or not.
