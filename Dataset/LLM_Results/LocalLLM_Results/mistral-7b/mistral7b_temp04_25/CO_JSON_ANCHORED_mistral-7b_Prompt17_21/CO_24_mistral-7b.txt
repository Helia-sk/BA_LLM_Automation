   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "ImageDrag image here or click to upload" area, initiating the task of uploading an image for a menu item.
   3) [Step 3] The user clicked somewhere else on the page (x: 664, y: 338), but did not complete the task of uploading an image.
   4) [Step 4] The user clicked on the "CategoryStartersMain CoursesDessertsDrinksSide Dishes" section, indicating they were exploring the menu items.
   5) [Step 5] The user clicked on the "svg" element, but it is unclear what this action corresponds to in the context of the page.
   6) [Step 6] The user clicked on the "Menu" link, suggesting they may have been trying to return to a previous page or navigate away from the site.
