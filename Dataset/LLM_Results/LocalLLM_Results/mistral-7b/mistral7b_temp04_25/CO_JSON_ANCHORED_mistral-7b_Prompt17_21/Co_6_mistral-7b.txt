 Tag: Drop-Off

   Reason: The user initiated a task (clicking on the "Customer Login" link) but did not complete it by entering their username and password. Instead, they only clicked on the input field for the username, which suggests that they may have been intending to enter their information but did not follow through.

   1) [Step 1] The user navigated to the website homepage.
   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "Customer Login" link located at the top right corner of the page.
   3) [Step 3] The user's cursor hovered over the username input field, but they did not click or type anything into it.
   4) [Step 4] The user's cursor clicked on the username input field, but still no input was provided.
   5) [Step 5] The user's cursor moved away from the input field and did not return to complete the login process.

   I have considered all the logs in my decision making as I have analyzed each initiated task and checked if they were completed or abandoned. In this case, since one of the initiated tasks (the login process) was abandoned, I classified it as a drop-off session.
