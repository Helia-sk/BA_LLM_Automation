==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off

   Reason: The user initiated a task (clicking on "Add Item") but did not complete it, indicating an incomplete action. This suggests that the user may have left the site without completing the intended action.

   1) [Step 1] User navigated to the restaurant's dashboard menu page.
   2) [Step 2] User clicked on the "Add Item" button, initiating an action to add a new item.
   3) [Step 3] User clicked on the "Saladmixvery healthy" option, which was one of the items available for addition. However, this action did not lead to the completion of adding the item.
   (The user did not complete any other initiated tasks such as uploading an image or clicking on "Starters", "Main Courses", "Desserts", "Drinks", or "Side Dishes". The user also did not click on the "Save" button, which would have finalized the addition of the item.)
   (The log does not provide evidence that the user returned to complete any other tasks after this point, suggesting a drop-off.)
