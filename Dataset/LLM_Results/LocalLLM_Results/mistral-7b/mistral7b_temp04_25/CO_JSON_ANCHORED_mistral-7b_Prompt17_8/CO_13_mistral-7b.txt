==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: One of the initiated tasks (View Details) was abandoned, indicating that the user did not complete all the intended actions.

   1) [Step 1] The user navigated to the restaurant dashboard page ("History", clicked at x:691, y:121).
   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "View Details" button (at x:1537, y:337), but then abandoned this action.
   3) [Step 3] The user clicked on the "X" button to close a UI element at x:1206, y:329.
   4) [Step 4] The user clicked on another UI element ("X") at x:1537, y:337 (the same location as "View Details"), but the context suggests it's a different element.
   5) [Step 5] The user closed the session without performing any other actions that could be considered part of the intended conversion flow.

In this log file, all initiated tasks were not completed, and one task was abandoned (View Details), which leads to classifying this session as a drop-off. It is essential to consider every log in the analysis to ensure an accurate classification.
