 Tag: Drop-Off

   Reason: One of the initiated tasks (clicking on the "Customer Login" button) was abandoned as there are no subsequent logs indicating completion of the login process. The user did not proceed to any other task that could be considered a conversion, such as providing username or password.

   1) [Step 1] The user navigated to the website (URL: http://localhost:5173/customer/login).
   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "Customer Login" link (x: 633, y: 35).
   3) [Step 3] The user clicked on the username input field (x: 451, y: 310). This could be considered an attempt to enter a username.
   4) [Step 4] The user clicked outside of the username input field (x: 433, y: 320), which suggests that the user might have decided not to proceed with entering a username.
   5) [Step 5] The user clicked on the password input field (no specific coordinates provided). This could be another attempt to interact with the form, but there are no subsequent logs indicating completion of the login process.
   After examining all the logs, it is clear that the user did not complete any task that could be considered a conversion, and one of the initiated tasks (clicking on the "Customer Login" button) was abandoned, so the session was a drop-off.
