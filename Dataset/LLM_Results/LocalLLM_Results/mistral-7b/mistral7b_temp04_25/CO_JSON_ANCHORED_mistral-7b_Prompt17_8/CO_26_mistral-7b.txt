==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: Although the user initiated a task by clicking on the "Add Item" button, they did not complete the subsequent steps required to add an item to the menu. Instead, they clicked on other elements within the menu section but didn't interact with any of the input fields or upload images as expected for adding an item.

  1) [Step 1] The user navigated to the restaurant dashboard menu page (/restaurant/dashboard/menu).
  2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "Add Item" button, indicating they intended to add a new menu item.
  3) [Step 3] The user clicked on various elements within the menu section but didn't interact with any of the input fields or upload images as expected for adding an item.
  4) [Step 4] The user clicked on the "Saladmixvery healthy" and "best dessert ever" items, but again did not proceed to add these items to the menu.
  5) [Step 5] The user clicked on an SVG element without any discernible action or interaction taking place.
  6) [Step 6] The user did not interact with any other elements that would indicate they completed the task of adding a new item to the menu.

   It is important to note that I have considered all the logs provided in this analysis, and the user did not complete all the initiated tasks required for adding an item to the menu, so the session was classified as a drop-off.
