==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: Although the user initiated a click on the "Customer Login" link, they did not complete the subsequent tasks such as entering their username and password. The user clicked on the username field but didn't provide any input, which indicates that they might have decided to leave or abandon the process at some point.

   User Journey:
   1) [Step 1] The user navigated to the website homepage (not shown in logs).
   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "Customer Login" link, which was the first initiated task.
   3) [Step 3] The user clicked on the username field but did not provide any input, indicating they might have left or abandoned the process. No further actions were logged, so it can be assumed that the user did not proceed with entering their password or submitting the login form.
