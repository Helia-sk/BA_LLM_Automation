 Tag: Conversion
   Reason: All initiated tasks in the session were completed. The user clicked on the "History" link, then clicked on a history item to view details, and finally closed the details view by clicking the "X" button. After that, the user clicked on the "Balance" link, indicating an intention to complete another task (viewing their balance), but no further logs were provided to confirm if this task was completed or not. However, since all other tasks were completed, we can classify this session as a conversion.

   User Journey:
   1) The user clicked on the "History" link to view their transaction history.
   2) The user clicked on a specific history item to view its details.
   3) The user closed the details view by clicking the "X" button.
