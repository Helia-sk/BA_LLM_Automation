 Tag: Conversion
   Reason: All initiated tasks in this session have been completed. The user navigated to the restaurant page (Session started), scrolled through the page, clicked on an image, and then scrolled again before leaving the page. Although there is no explicit action that can be considered a conversion, the fact that the user interacted with multiple elements on the page suggests they were engaged and potentially found what they were looking for.

  1) [Step 1] The user navigated to the restaurant page ("/customer/dashboard/restaurant/4") from the homepage.
  2) [Step 2] The user scrolled down the page to view the content.
  3) [Step 3] The user clicked on an image within the restaurant's details section.
  4) [Step 4] The user scrolled again, indicating they were still interacting with the page.
  5) [Step 5] The user left the page, but since all initiated tasks have been completed, this session can be considered a conversion.
