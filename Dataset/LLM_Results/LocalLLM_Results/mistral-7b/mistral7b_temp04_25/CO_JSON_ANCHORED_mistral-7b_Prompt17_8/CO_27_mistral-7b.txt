 Tag: Conversion

   Reason: All initiated tasks were completed. The user made a click event on the "Accept" button, which implies they have interacted with the order acceptance function (endpoint: orders.accept_order). This action was followed by an HTTP request and response indicating successful completion of the order acceptance operation. No further actions or events suggest that the session was abandoned.

   1) The user initiated a POST request to accept an order (/api/orders/26/accept) on the backend server using Chrome browser.
   2) The server responded with an OPTIONS request, indicating it is preparing to handle the incoming POST request.
   3) The user made another POST request to accept the order again, this time with a response from the server confirming the successful completion of the operation (status_code: 200).
   4) On the frontend, the user clicked on the "Accept" button, which triggered an event indicating that the order acceptance action was completed successfully.
   5) No further events or actions were recorded to suggest that the session was abandoned.
