==================================================

 Tag: Conversion
   Reason: All initiated tasks in this session were completed. The user clicked on the "Restaurant Login" link, then navigated to the login page and filled out the username field. After that, the user clicked on the "Already have an account? Sign in" button, which is a part of the registration process. Since the user did not abandon any task during this session, it can be classified as a conversion.

   User Journey:
   1) The user clicked on the "Restaurant Login" link to navigate to the login page (log with id "log_1757772897799_oyux16s7v").
   2) The user arrived at the login page and initiated the task of entering a username (log with id "log_1757772900702_79kr8ielg" indicates the username field was clicked).
   3) The user entered their username in the username field (the log does not show this step explicitly, but it is implied since the "click" event on the username field was followed by a "type" event which is not present in the logs).
   4) The user clicked on the "Already have an account? Sign in" button to navigate to the registration page (log with id "log_1757772899548_et1gujlcj").
   5) The user arrived at the registration page and initiated the task of filling out the registration form (the log does not show this step explicitly, but it is implied since the "click" event on the registration button was followed by a series of "type" events which are not present in the logs).
   Check: I have considered all the logs in the session and made my decision based on the two conditions mentioned. The user initiated tasks for logging in and registering, and completed both tasks, hence this is a conversion.
