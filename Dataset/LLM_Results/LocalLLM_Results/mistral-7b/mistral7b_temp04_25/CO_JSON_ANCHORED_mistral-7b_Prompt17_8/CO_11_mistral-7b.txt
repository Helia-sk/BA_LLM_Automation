 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user did not complete all initiated tasks. The session started with a visit to the dashboard (log 10), then a scroll event (log 9) and another scroll event (log 8). However, the user did not initiate any other tasks after this point, such as clicking on a specific link or filling out a form, which suggests that they abandoned the session before completing all tasks.

   2) [Step 2] The user scrolled down the page (log 9).
   3) [Step 3] The user continued scrolling further down the page (log 8).
   However, no further actions were initiated by the user, indicating that they dropped off before completing any other tasks.
