==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: One of the initiated tasks (uploading an image for a menu item) was abandoned. The user clicked on the "ImageDrag image here or click to upload" form but did not complete the task.

   1) [Step 1] The user accessed the restaurant dashboard page ("http://localhost:5173/restaurant/dashboard/menu").
   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "Menu" link located at x = 586, y = 124.
   3) [Step 3] The user navigated to the menu management page where they could add new items or edit existing ones.
   4) [Step 4] The user initiated the task of uploading an image for a new menu item by clicking on the form provided. However, the user did not complete this task and abandoned it.
   Note: The log file does not contain any subsequent logs indicating that the user completed any other tasks or navigated to another page, so it is reasonable to classify this session as a drop-off based on the incomplete initiated task.
