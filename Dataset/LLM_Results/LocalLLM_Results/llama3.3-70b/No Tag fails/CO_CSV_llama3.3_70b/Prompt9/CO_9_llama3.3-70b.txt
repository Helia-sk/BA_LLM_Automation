==================================================

This appears to be a log file containing user interaction events with a web application. Each line represents a single event, and the format is consistent across all lines.

Here's a breakdown of the information contained in each line:

1. `log_<timestamp>_<id>`: A unique identifier for the log entry, where `<timestamp>` is a Unix timestamp (in milliseconds) and `<id>` is a random string.
2. `frontend`: The type of event (in this case, all events are from the frontend).
3. `click.v1` or `scroll.v1`: The type of interaction event (either a click or scroll).
4. `session_<sessionId>_<userId>`: A unique identifier for the user session, where `<sessionId>` is a random string and `<userId>` is a random string.
5. `log_<timestamp>_<id>` (again): Another instance of the log entry ID.
6. `anonymous`: The username associated with the event (in this case, all events are from an anonymous user).
7. `/customer/dashboard/...`: The URL path where the event occurred.
8. A JSON object containing additional information about the event:
	* `app_version`: The version of the application.
	* `autofill_used`: A boolean indicating whether autofill was used (always false in this log).
	* `caps_lock_on`: A boolean indicating whether the caps lock key was on (always false in this log).
	* `client_validation_passed`: A boolean indicating whether client-side validation passed (always true in this log).
	* `component`: The component that triggered the event (always "unknown" in this log).
	* `details`: Additional details about the event, such as:
		+ `className`: The CSS class of the element that was clicked or scrolled.
		+ `id`: The ID of the element that was clicked or scrolled.
		+ `schema_version`: The version of the schema used to validate the event data.
		+ `tagName`: The HTML tag name of the element that was clicked or scrolled.
		+ `text`: The text content of the element that was clicked or scrolled.
		+ `trigger`: The type of trigger that caused the event (e.g., "click" or "scroll").
		+ `x` and `y`: The coordinates of the click event (only present for click events).
	* `event_time`: The timestamp when the event occurred (in ISO 8601 format).
	* `password_length`: The length of the password field (always 0 in this log, since no password fields are involved).
	* `perf`: An object containing performance metrics (always empty in this log).
	* `submit_trigger`: The type of trigger that caused the event (e.g., "click" or "scroll").
	* `system_noise`: A boolean indicating whether system noise was present (always false in this log).
	* `url`: The URL where the event occurred.
	* `userAgent`: The user agent string of the browser that triggered the event.
	* `username_length`: The length of the username field (always 0 in this log, since no username fields are involved).
	* `viewport`: An object containing information about the viewport:
		+ `height` and `width`: The height and width of the viewport.
