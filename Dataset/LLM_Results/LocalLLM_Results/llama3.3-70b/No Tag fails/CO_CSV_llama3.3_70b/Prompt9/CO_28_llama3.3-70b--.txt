==================================================

Tag: Conversion [The session ended with a successful order completion, as indicated by the repeated requests to `/api/orders/26/complete`].

Here's the step-by-step breakdown of the user journey:

1. The user navigated to the login page (`/restaurant/login`) and entered their password (indicated by `input_change.v1` event for password input).
2. The user clicked on the "Sign In" button (`click.v1` event with text "Sign In").
3. A form submit event (`form_submit.v2`) was triggered, indicating that the login credentials were submitted.
4. After logging in, the user navigated to the history page (`/restaurant/dashboard/history`).
5. The user clicked on a "History" link or button (`click.v1` event with text "History").
6. The user then clicked on a "View Details" button (`click.v1` event with text "View Details") to view more information about an order.
7. The user navigated through the order details and eventually reached the order completion page (`/api/orders/26/complete`).
8. Multiple requests were made to complete the order (`http_request.v1` and `http_response.v1` events for `/api/orders/26/complete`), indicating that the order was successfully completed.

Note: Although there are no explicit login and logout events, the presence of a successful form submit event for login credentials and subsequent navigation to protected pages (e.g., history and order details) suggests that the user was authenticated during this session. The repeated requests to complete the order also imply a successful conversion.
