==================================================

Tag: Conversion [The session ended with a request to `/api/orders/21/complete`, which suggests that the user completed an order, indicating a successful conversion].

Here is the step-by-step outline of the user journey:

1. The user clicked on the "History" button (`log_1757835951066_9edj3bwaz`) on the restaurant dashboard history page, navigating to this section.
2. The user then clicked on the "View Details" button (`log_1757835961979_hw4mtgead`) to view more information about a specific order or event in their history.
3. After viewing the details, the user clicked on a button that is not explicitly labeled in the logs provided but is associated with an 'X' (`log_1757835963781_2e9f53t2n`), which might indicate closing a detail view or canceling an action.
4. Following this, the user interacted with another element on the page (`log_1757835964770_mkg4r77nu`) that is labeled "Done", suggesting they were completing a task or confirming some details.
5. The frontend interactions are then followed by backend requests to retrieve order details (`/api/orders/21/details`), indicating the user's interest in completing an order.
6. Finally, the session includes multiple requests to complete an order (`/api/orders/21/complete`), which strongly suggests that the user successfully converted by completing their intended action on the website.

This journey indicates a conversion because it ends with the user apparently completing an order, as evidenced by the repeated attempts to access the order completion endpoint. The specific actions (e.g., viewing history, details, and then moving towards completion) align with a typical user flow leading to a conversion event in an e-commerce or similar context.
