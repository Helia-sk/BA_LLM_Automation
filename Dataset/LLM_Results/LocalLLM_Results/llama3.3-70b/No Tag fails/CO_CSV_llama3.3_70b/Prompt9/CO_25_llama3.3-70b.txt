==================================================

Tag: Drop-Off [The session does not show a clear indication of a conversion, such as a successful login, logout, or completion of a specific goal like making an order or adding items to cart. The user's interactions are mainly clicks and scrolls on the menu page without any conclusive action that signifies a conversion].

Here is the step-by-step outline of the user journey:

1. **Initial Request**: The user makes an initial request to `/api/menu/` (backend), which suggests they are accessing the menu section of the application.
2. **Menu Access Attempts**: There are multiple requests and responses to `/api/menu/22` and `/api/menu/`, indicating the user is likely navigating through different parts of the menu or trying to access specific menu items.
3. **Frontend Interactions**: The user interacts with the frontend, specifically on the `/restaurant/dashboard/menu` page, where they perform a click action on an element with the text "Menu" and later scroll down the page.
4. **Click on Menu Item**: There is another click event recorded, but the details of what exactly was clicked are not specified beyond it being an SVG element.
5. **No Conversion Event**: Despite these interactions, there is no clear evidence of a conversion event such as placing an order, adding items to cart, logging in, or logging out, which would typically signify that the user's session had achieved its intended goal.

Given the information provided, the user seems to be exploring the menu section without taking any definitive action that could be classified as a conversion. Therefore, this session is best categorized as a drop-off due to the lack of conclusive evidence indicating the achievement of a specific goal related to conversions.
