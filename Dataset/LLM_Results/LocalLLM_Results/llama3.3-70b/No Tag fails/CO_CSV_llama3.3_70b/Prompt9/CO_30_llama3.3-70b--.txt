==================================================

Tag: Conversion [The session ended with a "Reject" button click, indicating that the user completed an action, and there are multiple interactions with the dashboard and history pages before this action, suggesting that the user was engaged with the content].

Here is the step-by-step breakdown of the user journey:

1. The user navigated to the `/restaurant/dashboard` page at `15:20:35.792Z`, initiating a new session (`session_1758986435792_f2fzn6hdj`).
2. At `15:20:43.885Z`, the user clicked on the "History" link, navigating to the `/restaurant/dashboard/history` page.
3. The user then clicked on the "View Details" button at `15:20:45.667Z`, indicating interest in a specific order or history item.
4. At `15:20:49.152Z`, the user closed a details view by clicking the "X" button, returning to the history page.
5. The user then interacted with an unknown element ( possibly a button or link) on the history page at `15:20:49.915Z`.
6. Finally, at `15:20:52.428Z`, the user clicked the "Reject" button, which is likely related to an order or request, indicating that they completed an action and achieved their goal.
7. The backend logs show a series of HTTP requests and responses around the same time as the frontend "Reject" button click, including a reject order API call (`/api/orders/25/reject`), suggesting successful communication between the client and server for this action.

The presence of multiple interactions with the dashboard and history pages before the final "Reject" button click suggests that the user was engaged with the content and ultimately achieved their goal, leading to the classification of this session as a conversion.
