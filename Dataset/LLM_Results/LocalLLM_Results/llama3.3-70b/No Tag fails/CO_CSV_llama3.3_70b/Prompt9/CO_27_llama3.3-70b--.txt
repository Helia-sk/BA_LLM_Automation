Tag: Conversion [The session ended with an "Accept" button click on the /restaurant/dashboard page, which suggests that the user completed their intended action].

Here is the step-by-step user journey:

1. The user navigated to the /restaurant/dashboard page (log_1758985707836_pm260wx8m).
2. The user interacted with an element (likely a button or link) on the page, as indicated by a click event with a tagName of "svg" (log_1758985707836_pm260wx8m).
3. Approximately 7 seconds later, the user clicked the "Accept" button (log_1758985714781_tw6p4axzk), which suggests that they were confirming an action or decision.
4. The backend received a series of http_request and http_response events related to accepting an order (/api/orders/26/accept) around the same time as the "Accept" button click, indicating that the frontend action triggered a corresponding backend action (ids: 830728ad-7f89-4eb1-8ea7-ca32ca8aab7a, 9e39fd4f-fd72-42fa-97f5-2332c5c11a0a, 34ad601b-539f-4035-a106-7ddac540e434, 170792b6-4092-471d-8f8a-4e1f4fe981e8).
 
The presence of these events in close proximity suggests that the user successfully completed their intended action (accepting an order), which is why this session is classified as a conversion.
