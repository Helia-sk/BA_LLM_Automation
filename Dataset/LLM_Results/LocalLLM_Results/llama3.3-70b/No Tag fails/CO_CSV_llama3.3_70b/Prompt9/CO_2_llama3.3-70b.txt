==================================================

This appears to be a log file containing user interaction events with a web application, specifically a customer login page. The logs are in JSON format and contain various details about each event.

Here's a breakdown of the information contained in the logs:

1. **Event type**: Each log entry represents a specific event, such as `click.v1` (a click event) or `input_change.v1` (an input change event).
2. **Timestamp**: The timestamp of when the event occurred, in ISO 8601 format (e.g., `2025-09-13T14:10:40.076Z`).
3. **Session ID**: A unique identifier for the user's session (`session_1757771443548_7eqjj0e9b`).
4. **Log ID**: A unique identifier for each log entry (`log_1757772640076_ko6uzo7bv`).
5. **User agent**: Information about the user's browser and device (`Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/140.0.0.0 Safari/537.36`).
6. **URL**: The URL of the page where the event occurred (`http://localhost:5173/customer/login`).
7. **Viewport dimensions**: The size of the user's browser window (`height`: 695, `width`: 767).
8. **Event details**: Specific information about the event, such as:
	* For click events: `className`, `id`, `tagName`, `text`, and `x` and `y` coordinates.
	* For input change events: `finalValueLength`, `inputId`, `inputName`, `inputType`, and `inputValue`.
9. **Autofill status**: Whether the user has autofilled any form fields (`autofill_used`: false).
10. **Caps lock status**: Whether the caps lock key is enabled on the user's keyboard (`caps_lock_on`: false).
11. **Client validation status**: Whether client-side validation has been performed on the form data (`client_validation_passed`: true).

These logs can be useful for analyzing user behavior, debugging issues, and optimizing the user experience of the customer login page.
