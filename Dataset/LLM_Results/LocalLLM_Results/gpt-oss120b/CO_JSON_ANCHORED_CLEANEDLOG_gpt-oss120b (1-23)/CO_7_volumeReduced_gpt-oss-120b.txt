Prompt: Determine if the session was a drop-off or a conversion. Provide a reason for your classification. Then, outline the user journey step-by-step. Format your response as follows: Tag: Conversion||Drop-Off  [Reason]. 1) [Step 1] 2) [Step 2] 3) [Step 3] …
==================================================

**Tag: Conversion** – The session resulted in a successful order placement, evidenced by the backend `POST /api/customer/place_order` returning a **201 Created** status.

1) **Visit & interact with login page** – Frontend logs show multiple `input_change` and `click` events on `/customer/login`.  
2) **Submit login form** – Frontend `form_submit` event recorded, triggering a backend `POST /api/customer/login` which responded with **200 OK** (authentication succeeded).  
3) **Load post‑login data** – After authentication, the app fetched the user’s dashboard orders (`GET /api/customer/dashboard/orders/`, 200) and the full list of orders (`GET /api/customer/orders/`, 200).  
4) **Place an order** – User initiated a purchase, resulting in a backend `POST /api/customer/place_order` that returned **201 Created**, confirming the order was recorded.  
5) **Confirm order status** – Subsequent `GET /api/customer/orders/` calls (200) likely refreshed the order list to show the newly placed order.  

Thus, the user completed the conversion funnel by successfully logging in and placing an order.
