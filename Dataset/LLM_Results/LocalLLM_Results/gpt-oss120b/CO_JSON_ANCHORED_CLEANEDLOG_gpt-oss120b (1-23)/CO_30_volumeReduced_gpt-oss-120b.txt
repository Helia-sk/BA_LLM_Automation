Prompt: Determine if the session was a drop-off or a conversion. Provide a reason for your classification. Then, outline the user journey step-by-step. Format your response as follows: Tag: Conversion||Drop-Off  [Reason]. 1) [Step 1] 2) [Step 2] 3) [Step 3] …
==================================================

**Tag: Conversion** – The session ended with a successful `POST /api/orders/25/reject` that returned a 200 status, indicating the user completed the intended action (rejecting an order), which we treat as the conversion goal.

**User Journey:**  
1) **GET /api/orders/** – The user requested the list of orders (request logged, then a 200 JSON response of size 2802).  
2) **GET /api/orders/14/details** – The user opened the details page for order 14 (request logged, then a 200 JSON response of size 336).  
3) **POST /api/orders/25/reject** – The user submitted a rejection for order 25 (request logged, then a 200 JSON response confirming the action).  

*(Each of the above actions was preceded by an OPTIONS pre‑flight request, which also returned 200.)*
