Prompt: Determine if the session was a drop-off or a conversion. Provide a reason for your classification. Then, outline the user journey step-by-step. Format your response as follows: Tag: Conversion||Drop-Off  [Reason]. 1) [Step 1] 2) [Step 2] 3) [Step 3] …
==================================================

**Tag: Conversion** – The session culminated in a successful `PUT /api/menu/18` request that returned HTTP 200, indicating the user’s intended action (updating a menu item) was completed.

**User Journey**

1. **Navigate to menu dashboard** – Frontend logs show a click on `/restaurant/dashboard/menu`.  
2. **Interact with the edit form** – An `input_change` event records the user modifying form fields for a menu item.  
3. **Submit the form** – A `form_submit` event logs the user pressing the “Save/Update” button.  
4. **Backend receives update request** – A `PUT /api/menu/18` request is logged (no response size yet).  
5. **Backend processes and confirms** – The corresponding `PUT` response returns status 200 with a JSON payload (response size 140).  
6. **Refresh menu list** – Subsequent `GET /api/menu/` requests/responses (status 200, size 865) fetch the updated menu, confirming the change is now visible.  

The successful update and immediate retrieval of the refreshed menu indicate the user completed the desired conversion rather than abandoning the flow.
