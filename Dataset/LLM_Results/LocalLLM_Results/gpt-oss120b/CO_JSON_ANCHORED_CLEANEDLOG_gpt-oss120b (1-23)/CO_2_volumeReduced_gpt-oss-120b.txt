==================================================

**Tag: Conversion** – The backend logs show a successful `POST /api/customer/register` returning **201 Created**, indicating the user completed the intended action (registration), which qualifies as a conversion.

**User Journey:**  
1) User lands on the **/customer/login** page.  
2) User begins typing into form fields – multiple **input_change** events are recorded.  
3) User clicks on interactive elements (e.g., “Login” or “Register” button) – several **click** events are logged.  
4) User submits the form – a **form_submit** event is captured.  
5) The frontend initiates a request to the registration API (pre‑flight **OPTIONS** followed by **POST /api/customer/register**).  
6) The backend processes the request and returns **201 Created**, confirming the user’s registration (conversion).
