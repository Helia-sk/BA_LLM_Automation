Tag: Conversion [The user successfully submitted the login form, the backend returned a 200 OK for the login request, and subsequent API calls fetched opening hours, delivery areas, and orders, indicating the user proceeded past the login funnel.]  
1) User lands on **/restaurant/login** page (frontend events: clicks and input changes).  
2) User fills in credentials (input_change events) and clicks the submit button (click event).  
3) User submits the login form (form_submit event).  
4) Backend receives a **POST /api/login** request and responds with **200 OK** (login.login http_response).  
5) After authentication, the frontend makes a series of GET requests:  
   - **GET /api/settings/opening_hours** (settings.get_opening_hours) → 200 OK.  
   - **GET /api/settings/delivery_areas** (delivery.get_delivery_areas) → 200 OK.  
   - **GET /api/orders/** (orders.get_orders) → 200 OK.  
6) All data loads successfully, indicating the user has moved into the authenticated area of the application.
