==================================================

Tag: Conversion [The user successfully submitted a new menu item, which was created (HTTP 201) and then retrieved (HTTP 200), indicating the intended goal was achieved.]

1) User lands on **/restaurant/dashboard/menu** (frontend click events on the page).  
2) User fills out the menu‑item form (multiple `input_change` events).  
3) User submits the form (`form_submit` event).  
4) The frontend sends a **POST /api/menu/** request to the backend; the server responds with **201 Created** (menu item added).  
5) The frontend refreshes the menu list, issuing an **OPTIONS** pre‑flight followed by a **GET /api/menu/** request; the server returns **200 OK** with the updated list.  
6) The user sees the new item in the menu, completing the conversion.
