Prompt: Determine if the session was a drop-off or a conversion. Provide a reason for your classification. Then, outline the user journey step-by-step. Format your response as follows: Tag: Conversion||Drop-Off  [Reason]. 1) [Step 1] 2) [Step 2] 3) [Step 3] …
==================================================

**Tag: Conversion** – The session includes a `POST /api/customer/place_order` that returned **201 Created**, indicating the user successfully placed an order.  

1) **GET /api/customer/orders/** – User requests their orders list (request logged, then 200 OK response).  
2) **GET /api/customer/dashboard/orders/** – User views order history on the dashboard (request logged, then 200 OK response).  
3) **OPTIONS /api/customer/place_order** – Browser sends CORS pre‑flight request before posting the order (request logged, then 200 OK response).  
4) **POST /api/customer/place_order** – User submits a new order; server responds with **201 Created** (order successfully placed).  
5) **OPTIONS /api/customer/place_order** – Another pre‑flight request for a subsequent order attempt (request logged, then 200 OK response).  
6) **POST /api/customer/place_order** – User attempts to place another order; server responds with **400 Bad Request** (failed attempt).  

The successful 201 response in step 4 confirms a conversion despite a later failed attempt.
