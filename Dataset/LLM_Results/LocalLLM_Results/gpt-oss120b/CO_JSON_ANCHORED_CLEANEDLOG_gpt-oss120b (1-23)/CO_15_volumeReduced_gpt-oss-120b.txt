Prompt: Determine if the session was a drop-off or a conversion. Provide a reason for your classification. Then, outline the user journey step-by-step. Format your response as follows: Tag: Conversion||Drop-Off  [Reason]. 1) [Step 1] 2) [Step 2] 3) [Step 3] …
==================================================

**Tag: Conversion** – The session ends with a successful order placement (POST /api/customer/place_order returned 201 Created), indicating the user completed the purchase funnel.

**Reason:** After logging in (POST /api/customer/login → 200), the user fetched order history and the orders list, then submitted a new order which was created successfully. The presence of a 201 response confirms a conversion rather than a drop‑off.

**User Journey:**

1. **Visit login page** – Front‑end logs show input changes and clicks on `/customer/login`.  
2. **Submit login form** – `form_submit` event followed by backend POST `/api/customer/login` (200 OK).  
3. **Pre‑flight OPTIONS request** – Browser sends OPTIONS to `/api/customer/login` (200).  
4. **Load dashboard data** – GET `/api/customer/dashboard/orders/` (200) to display recent orders.  
5. **View orders list** – GET `/api/customer/orders/` (200) retrieves the full orders list.  
6. **Pre‑flight OPTIONS for order placement** – OPTIONS `/api/customer/place_order` (200).  
7. **Place a new order** – POST `/api/customer/place_order` (201 Created) – the conversion point.  
8. **Fetch order details** – GET `/api/customer/orders/25/details` (200) to show the newly created order.  
9. **Additional pre‑flight OPTIONS** – OPTIONS calls for the same endpoints (200) as part of CORS handling.  

Thus, the session progressed from login through order browsing to a successful purchase, qualifying it as a conversion.
