**User Journey**

1. **GET /api/orders/** – Retrieved the list of orders (response 200, 838 bytes).  
2. **OPTIONS /api/orders/21/complete** – Pre‑flight request for the upcoming POST (response 200).  
3. **GET /api/orders/21/details** – Viewed the details of order #21 (response 200, 332 bytes).  
4. **OPTIONS /api/orders/21/complete** – Pre‑flight request for the completion endpoint (response 200).  
5. **POST /api/orders/21/complete** – Marked order #21 as completed (response 200, 58 bytes).
