Prompt: Determine if the session was a drop-off or a conversion. Provide a reason for your classification. Then, outline the user journey step-by-step. Format your response as follows: Tag: Conversion||Drop-Off  [Reason]. 1) [Step 1] 2) [Step 2] 3) [Step 3] …
==================================================

**Tag: Conversion** [The session includes a successful POST to `/api/customer/place_order` that returned HTTP 201 (Created), indicating an order was placed.]  

1) User navigates to the login page (`/customer/login`).  
2) User enters credentials – multiple **input_change** events are recorded.  
3) User clicks the “Login” button (**click** event).  
4) User submits the login form (**form_submit** event).  
5) Backend processes the login (`POST /api/customer/login`) and returns **200 OK**.  
6) After logging in, the user accesses the dashboard order view (`GET /api/customer/dashboard/orders`) which returns **200 OK**.  
7) The user also requests the full order list (`GET /api/customer/orders`) – response **200 OK**.  
8) User initiates a purchase; an **OPTIONS** pre‑flight request is made, followed by a **POST** to `/api/customer/place_order`.  
9) Backend creates the order and responds with **201 Created**, confirming the transaction.  
10) Subsequent GET requests to the orders endpoints show the newly created order.  

These steps culminate in a completed purchase, so the session is classified as a **conversion**.
