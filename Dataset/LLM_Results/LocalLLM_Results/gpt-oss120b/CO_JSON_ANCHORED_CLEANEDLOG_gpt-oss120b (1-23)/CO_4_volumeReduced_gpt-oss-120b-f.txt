Prompt: Determine if the session was a drop-off or a conversion. Provide a reason for your classification. Then, outline the user journey step-by-step. Format your response as follows: Tag: Conversion||Drop-Off  [Reason]. 1) [Step 1] 2) [Step 2] 3) [Step 3] …
==================================================

Tag: Drop-Off [The session only contains frontend interactions on the login page (input changes, clicks, scroll, and a form submit) with no subsequent backend request indicating a successful login or navigation away, so the user did not convert.]  

1) User opens /restaurant/login (page).  
2) Performs several input_change actions (typing credentials).  
3) Clicks on fields/buttons (multiple click events).  
4) Scrolls the page ( scroll event).  
5) Submits the login form ( form_submit event).  
6) No backend response or further navigation is recorded – the session ends without a successful login, resulting in a drop‑off.
