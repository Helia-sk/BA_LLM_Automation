Prompt: Determine if the session was a drop-off or a conversion. Provide a reason for your classification. Then, outline the user journey step-by-step. Format your response as follows: Tag: Conversion||Drop-Off  [Reason]. 1) [Step 1] 2) [Step 2] 3) [Step 3] …
==================================================

Tag: Drop-Off  [No evidence of a successful login or navigation beyond the login page; only input changes and clicks were recorded, with no submission or success event.]

1) User lands on **/restaurant/login** page.  
2) User begins typing – first **input_change** event (e.g., enters email/username).  
3) User continues typing – second **input_change** event (e.g., continues email or starts password).  
4) User clicks a UI element – first **click** event (could be “show password” toggle or a field focus).  
5) User makes additional edits – two more **input_change** events (likely completing password entry).  
6) User clicks the **login/submit** button – second **click** event.  
7) User clicks another element (perhaps “forgot password” or attempts to re‑click login) – third **click** event.  

After these interactions, no further logs indicate a form submission success, redirect, or page change, so the session ends without conversion.
