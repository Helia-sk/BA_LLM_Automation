==================================================

Tag: Drop-Off [The session only contains frontend interactions on the login page (input changes, clicks, and a form submit) but no corresponding backend login request/response, indicating the user did not complete a successful login.)  
1) User lands on **/restaurant/login** page.  
2) User begins typing – first **input_change** event recorded.  
3) User clicks (e.g., to focus a field) – **click** event recorded.  
4) Additional **input_change** events as the user continues entering credentials.  
5) More **click** events (e.g., toggling password visibility or moving between fields).  
6) User triggers a **form_submit** event to attempt login.  
7) No backend **login** request/response is logged for this session, so the login was not completed → session ends in a drop‑off.
