Prompt: Determine if the session was a drop-off or a conversion. Provide a reason for your classification. Then, outline the user journey step-by-step. Format your response as follows: Tag: Conversion||Drop-Off  [Reason]. 1) [Step 1] 2) [Step 2] 3) [Step 3] …
==================================================

Tag: Drop-Off [Reason: The user successfully logged in (POST /api/customer/login → 200), but the subsequent order submission failed with a 400 Bad Request, so the purchase was never completed.]

1) User opens the login page (`/customer/login`).  
2) Front‑end logs record multiple input changes and clicks as the user enters credentials.  
3) User submits the login form (`form_submit` event).  
4) Browser sends a pre‑flight OPTIONS request to `/api/customer/login` (status 200).  
5) Backend receives the POST login request (`customer_login.login`) and returns 200 OK – authentication succeeds.  
6) User proceeds to place an order (likely after navigating to a checkout page).  
7) Browser sends a pre‑flight OPTIONS request to `/api/customer/place_order` (status 200).  
8) Backend receives the POST order request (`customer_place_order.place_order`) and returns 400 Bad Request – the order could not be processed.  
9) No further successful backend actions are logged; the session ends without a completed purchase.
