==================================================

Tag: Drop-Off [The session only contains frontend events on the login page (input changes and clicks) with no indication of a successful authentication request, navigation away from the login route, or any backend response. Hence the user did not complete the login conversion.]  

1) User opens the **/restaurant/login** page.  
2) User modifies one or more input fields (e.g., enters email/username).  
3) User clicks a button (likely “Next” or “Continue”).  
4) User makes additional input changes (e.g., enters password).  
5) User clicks again (possibly “Login”).  
6) User clicks a third time (perhaps retry or another UI element).  
7) Session ends without any backend request, status code, or navigation indicating a successful login.
