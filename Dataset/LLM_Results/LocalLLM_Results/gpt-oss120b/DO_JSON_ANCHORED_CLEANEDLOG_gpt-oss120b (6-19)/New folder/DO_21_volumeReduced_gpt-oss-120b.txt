Prompt: Determine if the session was a drop-off or a conversion. Provide a reason for your classification. Then, outline the user journey step-by-step. Format your response as follows: Tag: Conversion||Drop-Off  [Reason]. 1) [Step 1] 2) [Step 2] 3) [Step 3] …
==================================================

**Tag: Conversion** – The session includes a successful login (POST /api/login → 200) followed by authenticated requests to fetch the menu and orders, indicating the user progressed beyond the entry point and reached a functional part of the application rather than abandoning it.

**User Journey**  
1. **Visit login page** – Frontend logs show the user on `/restaurant/login`.  
2. **Enter credentials** – Multiple `input_change` events on the login form.  
3. **Submit login form** – `form_submit` event recorded.  
4. **Login request** – Backend `POST /api/login` request (`login.login`) returns 200 OK.  
5. **Navigate to dashboard** – Click events on `/restaurant/dashboard/menu` indicate the user moved to the menu view.  
6. **Load menu data** – Backend `GET /api/menu/` (`menu.get_menu_items`) returns 200 with JSON payload.  
7. **Load orders data** – Backend `GET /api/orders/` (`orders.get_orders`) returns 200 with JSON payload.  

The sequence shows the user successfully authenticated and accessed core features, qualifying this session as a conversion rather than a drop‑off.
