Prompt: Determine if the session was a drop-off or a conversion. Provide a reason for your classification. Then, outline the user journey step-by-step. Format your response as follows: Tag: Conversion||Drop-Off  [Reason]. 1) [Step 1] 2) [Step 2] 3) [Step 3] …
==================================================

**Tag: Conversion** – The session completed a successful login (`POST /api/login` returned 200) and immediately accessed protected resources (menu and orders), indicating the user progressed beyond the funnel rather than dropping off.

**User Journey**
1. **Landing on login page** – Frontend logs show activity on route `/restaurant/login`.  
2. **Entering credentials** – Multiple `input_change` events on the login page capture the user typing their username/password.  
3. **Clicking the login button** – A `click` event on `/restaurant/login` registers the user’s intent to submit.  
4. **Submitting the login form** – A `form_submit` event records the actual form submission.  
5. **Backend login request** – `POST /api/login` is received and responds with status 200 (successful authentication).  
6. **Navigating to dashboard/menu** – A `click` event on route `/restaurant/dashboard/menu` shows the user moving to the main dashboard after login.  
7. **Fetching menu data** – Backend logs a `GET /api/menu/` request returning status 200 with JSON payload (162 bytes).  
8. **Fetching orders data** – Backend logs a `GET /api/orders/` request returning status 200 with JSON payload (284 bytes).  

The sequence demonstrates a complete conversion flow: the user logged in successfully and accessed subsequent application features.
