Prompt: Determine if the session was a drop-off or a conversion. Provide a reason for your classification. Then, outline the user journey step-by-step. Format your response as follows: Tag: Conversion||Drop-Off  [Reason]. 1) [Step 1] 2) [Step 2] 3) [Step 3] …
==================================================

Tag: Conversion [The user successfully logged in, accessed their order data, and then logged out, indicating a completed conversion rather than abandoning the process.]

1) **Visit login page** – Front‑end logs show the user on route `/customer/login` (clicks and input changes).  
2) **Enter credentials** – Multiple `input_change` events record the user typing their login information.  
3) **Submit login form** – A `form_submit` event is logged, followed by a front‑end `click` on the login button.  
4) **Authenticate** – Backend receives an `OPTIONS` preflight then a `POST /api/customer/login`; response 200 confirms successful authentication.  
5) **Fetch protected data** – After login, the client sends a `GET /api/customer/orders/`; backend returns a 200 response with order data (size 781).  
6) **Logout** – The user initiates logout, triggering a `POST /api/logout`; backend responds with 200, ending the session.  

These steps demonstrate a complete user journey from login to accessing a core feature (order view) and then logging out, which qualifies as a conversion.
