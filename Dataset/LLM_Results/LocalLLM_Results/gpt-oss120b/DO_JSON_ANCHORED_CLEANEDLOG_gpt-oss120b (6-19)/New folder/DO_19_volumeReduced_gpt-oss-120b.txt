Tag: Conversion [The user successfully submitted the login form, received a 200 response, accessed protected resources (orders), and then logged out—indicating the intended conversion (successful login and activity) was achieved.]  

1) User lands on **/restaurant/login** (frontend page).  
2) User enters credentials – multiple **input_change** events are logged.  
3) User clicks the submit button – a **click** event is logged.  
4) User submits the form – a **form_submit** event is logged.  
5) Backend receives a **POST /api/login** request and returns **200** (login successful).  
6) After authentication, the user requests the orders list – a **GET /api/orders/** request returns **200** with data.  
7) User decides to end the session and triggers a logout – a **POST /api/logout** request returns **200**.  
8) Session concludes (user logged out).
