Prompt: Determine if the session was a drop-off or a conversion. Provide a reason for your classification. Then, outline the user journey step-by-step. Format your response as follows: Tag: Conversion||Drop-Off  [Reason]. 1) [Step 1] 2) [Step 2] 3) [Step 3] …
==================================================

**Tag: Conversion** – The session completed a full login‑order‑logout flow (POST /api/login 200, GET /api/orders 200, POST /api/logout 200), indicating the user achieved the intended outcome rather than abandoning the process.

**User Journey**

1. User clicks on the restaurant login page (`/restaurant/login`).  
2. User begins filling the login form – multiple `input_change` events are recorded.  
3. User submits the login form (`form_submit` on `/restaurant/login`).  
4. Browser performs an OPTIONS pre‑flight request to `/api/login` (backend response 200).  
5. Browser sends a POST request to `/api/login`; the backend returns 200 with JSON (login successful).  
6. After authentication, the app requests the orders list – an OPTIONS request to `/api/orders/` (backend response 200).  
7. Browser sends a GET request to `/api/orders/`; the backend returns 200 with the orders payload (user sees their orders).  
8. User initiates logout (implicit from later logs).  
9. Browser performs an OPTIONS pre‑flight to `/api/logout` (backend response 200).  
10. Browser sends a POST request to `/api/logout`; the backend returns 200 (logout successful).  

The sequence shows the user progressed from login through order retrieval to logout without dropping off, qualifying the session as a conversion.
