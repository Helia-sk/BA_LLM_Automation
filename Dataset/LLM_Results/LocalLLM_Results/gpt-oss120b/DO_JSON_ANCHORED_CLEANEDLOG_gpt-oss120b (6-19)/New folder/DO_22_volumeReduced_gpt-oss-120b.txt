Prompt: Determine if the session was a drop-off or a conversion. Provide a reason for your classification. Then, outline the user journey step-by-step. Format your response as follows: Tag: Conversion||Drop-Off  [Reason]. 1) [Step 1] 2) [Step 2] 3) [Step 3] …
==================================================

**Tag: Conversion** – The session includes a successful login request (`POST /api/login` returned 200) followed by activity on the dashboard (`/restaurant/dashboard/menu`) and associated API calls for menu and orders, indicating the user completed the intended action.

1) User lands on the login page (`/restaurant/login`).  
2) User interacts with the login form (clicks and input changes to enter credentials).  
3) User submits the login form (`form_submit` event).  
4) Backend processes the login (`POST /api/login`) and responds with HTTP 200.  
5) User is redirected to the dashboard menu (`/restaurant/dashboard/menu`).  
6) Dashboard loads menu data (`GET /api/menu/` → 200) and order data (`GET /api/orders/` → 200).  
7) User continues interacting with the menu page (clicks and input changes).  

The successful authentication and subsequent navigation to core app functionality constitute a conversion.
