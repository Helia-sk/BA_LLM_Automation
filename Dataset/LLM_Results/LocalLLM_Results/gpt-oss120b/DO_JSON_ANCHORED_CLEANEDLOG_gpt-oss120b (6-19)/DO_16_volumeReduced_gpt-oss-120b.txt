==================================================

Tag: Drop-Off [The session contains only frontend interactions on the login page (input changes, clicks, and a form submission) but no backend request confirming a successful login, indicating the user abandoned the process before conversion.]  

1) User lands on **/restaurant/login** page.  
2) User modifies input fields (several “input_change” events) to enter credentials.  
3) User clicks the login button (multiple “click” events).  
4) User triggers a form submission (“form_submit” event).  
5) No subsequent backend login request or successful response is recorded, so the session ends without conversion.
