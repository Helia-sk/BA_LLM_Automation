Prompt: Analyze the following log file ignore verbose logs. Determine if the session was a drop-off or a conversion. Provide a reason for your classification.
==================================================

**Classification:** Drop‑off  

**Why:**  
- The session (`session_1757763080934_tj3hw6dyl`) only contains interactions on the home page and the login page (`/restaurant/login`).  
- We see clicks on the “Restaurant Login” link, clicks into the username and password fields, and several `input_change` events (typing “dd” for username and a hidden password value).  
- **No** event that indicates a conversion is present – there is no form‑submit, “login” button click, navigation away from the login page, or any success‑type event (e.g., `login_success`, `order_complete`, `checkout_success`).  
- The last recorded action is the click on the login link, after which the user never submits the credentials.  

Because the user abandoned the flow before any conversion‑triggering action, the session is classified as a drop‑off.
