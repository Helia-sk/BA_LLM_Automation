Prompt: Analyze the following log file ignore verbose logs. Determine if the session was a drop-off or a conversion. Provide a reason for your classification.
==================================================

**Classification:** **Drop‑off**

**Why this session is a drop‑off rather than a conversion**

| Time (UTC) | Action (derived from the log) | What we see |
|------------|------------------------------|-------------|
| 12:15:32.750 | Click on the “Restaurant Partners …” link | User lands on the login page (`/restaurant/login`). |
| 12:15:34.477 | Click inside the *username* input field | Focus on the username field. |
| 12:15:35.119 | First keystroke in the username field (`d`) – debounced input | Username begins to be typed. |
| 12:15:39.057 | Blur (loss of focus) on the username field – value `d` | Username entry completed (still only one character). |
| 12:15:39.156 | Click on the **Sign In** button | Login attempt is submitted. |
| 12:15:41.998 | Blur on the password field – value hidden (`[HIDDEN]`) | Password field was touched, but no visible password length is recorded (still `0`). |
| 12:15:42.084 | Click on a page element labeled “Lieferspatz” (likely the homepage logo) | User navigates away from the login page immediately after the sign‑in click. |

**Missing evidence of a successful conversion**

* No subsequent events that indicate a successful login (e.g., navigation to a dashboard, order‑list page, or any “login_success” event).  
* No purchase‑related events (`order_placed`, `checkout_complete`, etc.).  
* The password field never registers a non‑zero length, suggesting the password was either left blank or cleared before submission.  
* The user’s next click is on the site’s logo, a typical “go back to home” action after a failed login.

Because the session ends with a login attempt that shows no successful authentication and the user immediately returns to the home page, the interaction terminates without achieving the intended goal (login → manage orders). Therefore, this session should be classified as a **drop‑off**.
