==================================================

Based on the provided logs, here's an analysis of a user's interaction with your application:

1. **User starts on the `/customer/dashboard` page:**
   - The user scrolls down (`scrollY` starts from 0 and increases) three times in quick succession (at `310.399`, `1348.800`, and `2044`), suggesting they were quickly browsing through content on the dashboard.
   - No other events logged during this time, so we assume they interacted only with scrolling.

2. **User navigates to `/customer/dashboard/restaurant/2`:**
   - The user clicks on an element with class `text-gray-400` (likely a restaurant card or link), which navigates them to the detailed restaurant page.
   - While on this page, they scroll down once (`scrollY` is 340).

3. **User interacts with restaurant details:**
   - The user clicks on an element with class `text-gray-400`, possibly another detail or action related to the restaurant (no further context provided).
   - They then click on a span element with text "No image available". This suggests there might be an issue with displaying the restaurant's image, and they clicked it perhaps to trigger a fallback mechanism or for more information.

4. **User adds restaurant to cart and goes to cart:**
   - The user clicks on a button with class `px-2 py-1 border rounded text-white bg-blue-500 hover:bg-blue-700` (likely an "Add to Cart" button), then navigates to the `/cart` page.
   - They scroll down once (`scrollY` is 340).

5. **User goes back to restaurant list and selects another restaurant:**
   - The user clicks on a link with class `text-gray-400`, likely going back to the restaurant list.
   - They then click on an `<a>` tag (likely another restaurant card or link), navigating them back to the detailed restaurant page (`/customer/dashboard/restaurant/2`).
   - Here, they scroll down once before clicking on a button with class `px-2 py-1 border rounded text-white bg-blue-500 hover:bg-blue-700`. This suggests they've selected another restaurant and added it to their cart.

6. **User navigates to `/cart`:**
   - The user clicks on an element with class `text-gray-400`, likely a link or button leading them to the `/cart` page.
   - They scroll down once (`scrollY` is 340).

7. **User views cart and proceeds to checkout:**
   - The user clicks on an `<a>` tag (likely a "Proceed to Checkout" link or button).
   - They then click on the "Cart" icon, which has class `px-2 py-1 border rounded text-white bg-blue-500 hover:bg-blue-700`. This could be either adding another item to the cart or proceeding with the current items in the cart.

From these logs, we can infer that:

- The user was browsing through restaurants and adding them to their cart.
- They encountered an issue with displaying a restaurant's image but interacted with it nonetheless.
- Their cart likely contains at least two different restaurants.
- They are currently on the `/cart` page, potentially reviewing or modifying their order before proceeding to checkout.
