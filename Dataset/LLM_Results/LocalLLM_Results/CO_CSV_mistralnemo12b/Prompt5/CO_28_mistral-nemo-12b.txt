==================================================

Based on the provided logs, here's a step-by-step analysis of user interactions and system responses:

1. **User Authentication:**
   - The user first visits the `/restaurant/login` page (not visible in logs).
   - At `15:10:49`, the user submits the login form (`form_submit.v2`) with data containing:
     - `username`: `[HIDDEN]` (assumed to be valid as no error is logged)
     - `password`: `[HIDDEN]` (also assumed to be valid)
   - After submission, there's no immediate error log or response from the server. Assuming authentication was successful.

2. **Dashboard Access:**
   - After successful login (if any), at `15:10:59`, the user clicks on the "History" link (`click.v1`) to navigate to the `/restaurant/dashboard/history` page.
   - The server responds with a HTTP 304 Not Modified status code (`http_response`), indicating that the client already has the current version of the requested resource.

3. **User Interactions with History Page:**
   - Once on the history page:
     1. At `15:11:09`, the user clicks on a link to view details of order ID `17` (`click.v1`), triggering an API request to `/api/orders/17/details`.
         - The server responds with a HTTP 200 OK status code and JSON data containing order details (`http_response`).
     2. At `15:11:34`, the user clicks on a "Back" button (`click.v1`) to return to the history page.
   - Continuing interaction with the history page:
     1. At `15:12:09`, the user clicks on a link to view details of order ID `18` (`click.v1`), triggering another API request to `/api/orders/18/details`.
         - The server responds with a HTTP 404 Not Found status code (`http_response`), suggesting that either the order doesn't exist or there's an issue accessing its details.
     2. At `15:13:39`, the user clicks on a "Close" button (`click.v1`) to dismiss the error message likely caused by the previous HTTP 404 response.

4. **Order Completion:**
   - After handling the error, at `15:16:27`, the user completes an order (ID `19`)` through API `/api/orders/complete`.
     - The server responds with a HTTP 200 OK status code (`http_response`), indicating successful order completion.

Throughout these interactions, there are no explicit error messages logged or displayed to the user. This suggests that the frontend is handling potential errors (like the HTTP 404) gracefully without disrupting the overall user experience. However, it's crucial for backend developers to ensure appropriate error handling and meaningful error responses to improve system reliability.

Additionally, there are several `http_response` logs without corresponding frontend interaction logs. These might be due to automatic refreshing or polling of data by the client-side application. It would be helpful to differentiate between user-triggered API requests and automated ones in the logs for better analysis.
