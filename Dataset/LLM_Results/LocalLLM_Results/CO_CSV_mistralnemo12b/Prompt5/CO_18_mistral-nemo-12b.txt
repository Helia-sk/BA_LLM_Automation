3. **User interacts with the username field:**
   - Clicks on the input field (log_1758983087916_loj1igqdu)
     - Timestamp: 2025-09-27T14:24:47.916Z

5. **User submits the login form:**
   - Enters and submits an empty password field (log_1758983089343_m4g10pdyh)
     - Timestamp: 2025-09-27T14:24:49.344Z

From these logs, we can infer that the user navigated to the login page, entered "User1" as the username but left the password field empty before submitting the form. The application then likely responded with a validation error or redirected them due to incomplete credentials (not shown in the provided logs).
