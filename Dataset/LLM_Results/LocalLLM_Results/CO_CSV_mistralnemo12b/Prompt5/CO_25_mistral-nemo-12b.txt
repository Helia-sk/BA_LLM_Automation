==================================================

**Tag:** Drop-Off

**Reason:** The user's journey ends after navigating to the menu page without any further interaction or backend requests.

**User Journey:**

1. **Click on 'Menu' Link**
   - A frontend click event occurred at `2025-09-27T15:03:48.126Z` with details:
     ```
     {
       "app_version": "web-1.4.2",
       "autofill_used": false,
       ...
       "text": "Menu",
       ...
     }
     ```

2. **Navigate to Menu Page**
   - The user navigated to the menu page (`/restaurant/dashboard/menu`), indicated by the change in URL and timestamp (`2025-09-27T15:03:48.467Z`).
   ```
   log_6f337f4b-6339-4cfc-a064-6ac31d4ac78d
   ```

3. **Scroll on Menu Page**
   - A frontend scroll event occurred at `2025-09-27T15:03:51.599Z`.
     ```
     {
       ...
       "trigger": "scroll",
       ...
     }
     ```

4. **Click on Menu Item**
   - Another frontend click event happened at `2025-09-27T15:03:55.886Z`, suggesting the user interacted with a menu item.
     ```
     {
       ...
       "x": 1134,
       "y": 588,
       ...
     }
     ```

However, after this interaction:
- There are no more frontend events recorded (e.g., no further clicks or scrolls).
- No backend requests were made after the initial navigation to the menu page (`/api/menu/`), suggesting no API calls for fetching menu details or performing any actions on the selected item.

Since there's no follow-up action or request after the user clicked on a menu item, it can be classified as a drop-off. The session ends without converting into a further action like viewing menu details or adding items to the cart.
