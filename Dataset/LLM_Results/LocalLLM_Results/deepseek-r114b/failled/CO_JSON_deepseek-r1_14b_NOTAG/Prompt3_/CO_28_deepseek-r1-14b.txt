Alright, let me try to figure out how to approach this problem. The user provided a JSON array of events from what seems like a web application's frontend logs. Each event has details about user interactions, such as clicks and form submissions.

First, I need to understand the structure of each event. They have fields like "attempt_id", "browser_id", "content_length", etc., and the "details" section varies depending on the event type—clicks, form submits, or input changes.

I think the main goal is to classify these events based on their types. So, I should categorize each event into one of three types: click, form submission, or input change. 

Looking at the first few entries:

- The first event has "event_name" as "click". It's a sign-in button click.
- The second is also a click but seems to be on some other element with text "Sign In".
- There are events where "schema_version" is "form_submit.v2", which indicates form submissions. These likely correspond to when the user submits their login credentials.
- Then there are input changes, like when the password field loses focus, which triggers an event.

I should go through each event and assign the correct classification based on the "event_name" or "schema_version". For example, events with "click" in "event_name" will be classified as click events. Those with "form_submit" in "schema_version" are form submissions, and those with "input_change" are input changes.

I also notice that some events have additional details like coordinates (x,y) or form elements. These might not affect the classification but provide context about where the user clicked or what field was changed.

So, my plan is to iterate through each event in the JSON array, check the relevant fields for the type of interaction, and classify them accordingly into click, form submit, or input change events.

Certainly! Below is the classification of each event based on its type:

### 1. Click Event
- **Description**: This event records a mouse click action by the user, typically on a button or link.
- **Example**:
  ```json
  {
    "event_name": "click",
    "details": {
      "schema_version": "click.v1",
      "tagName": "BUTTON",
      "text": "Sign In",
      "trigger": "click"
    }
  }
  ```

### 2. Form Submit Event
- **Description**: This event captures when a user submits a form, such as logging in.
- **Example**:
  ```json
  {
    "event_name": "form_submit",
    "details": {
      "schema_version": "form_submit.v2",
      "formAction": "http://localhost:5173/restaurant/login",
      "formMethod": "get"
    }
  }
  ```

### 3. Input Change Event
- **Description**: This event tracks changes in input fields, such as typing or losing focus.
- **Example**:
  ```json
  {
    "event_name": "input_change",
    "details": {
      "schema_version": "input_change.v1",
      "inputId": "password",
      "inputType": "password"
    }
  }
  ```

### Summary of Classifications:

| Event ID                       | Event Type       |
|-------------------------------|-----------------|
| log_1758985849132_sm9gb6j5r   | Click           |
| log_1758985849134_vaj1bttsz   | Form Submit     |
| log_1758985849032_pt9psc4kp   | Input Change    |
| log_1758985859153_6rhgxqztt   | Click           |
| log_1758985849134_5na5ry90h   | Form Submit     |
| log_1758985849132_se2my4qmv   | Click           |
| log_1758985859153_6rhgxqztt   | Click           |
| ...                           | ...             |

Each event is classified based on its type, which helps in understanding user interactions and improving the application's usability.
