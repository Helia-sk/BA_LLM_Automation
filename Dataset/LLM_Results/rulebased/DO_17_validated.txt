==================================================

Tag: Drop-Off [User interacted with the login page but didn't complete the login process].
1) The user clicked on the "Restaurant Partners" span, indicating interest in the restaurant partners section.
2) The user then clicked on the form and other elements on the login page, showing intent to log in.
3) However, despite interacting with the username input field and typing "User" and then completing it to "User1" (though not explicitly shown, the progression from "User" to "User1" suggests an attempt to enter credentials), there is no record of the user submitting the form or completing the login process.
