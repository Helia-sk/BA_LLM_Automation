==================================================

Tag: Drop-Off [User interacted with the login page but didn't complete the login process].
1) The user clicked on the "Restaurant Partners" link, indicating interest in logging in or registering.
2) The user then clicked on the username input field, suggesting an intention to start the login process.
3) However, despite entering a username ("User1") and interacting with the password field, the user ultimately clicked the "Register your restaurant or log in to manage orders" link again and then the login button without completing the login, indicating a drop-off in the conversion funnel.
