==================================================

Tag: Drop-Off [User interacted with the login page but didn't complete the login process].
1) The user clicked on the "Customer Login" link, indicating an intention to log in.
2) The user then clicked on the username input field and entered a username ("User1"), showing progress in the login process.
3) However, after entering the username and interacting with the password field (as indicated by clicks and input changes), there's no evidence of a successful login submission or completion, suggesting a drop-off during the login attempt.
