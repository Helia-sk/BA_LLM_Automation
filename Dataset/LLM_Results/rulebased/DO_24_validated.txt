==================================================

Tag: Drop-Off [User interacted with the login page but didn't complete the login process].
1) The user clicked on the "Restaurant Partners" span, indicating interest in the restaurant partners program.
2) The user then clicked on the username input field, suggesting an intention to log in.
3) However, despite entering a username ("User1") and interacting with the password field, the user ultimately clicked the "Sign In" button without completing the login process, as there is no record of a successful login or any subsequent actions that would indicate a completed conversion.
