Prompt: "Analyze the log file. Determine if the session was a drop-off or a conversion. Do not make a decision until you read all the logs. Consider every initiated task and both of the following conditions in your decision-making. If all initiated tasks are completed → Tag: Conversion. Even if one of the initiated tasks is abandoned → Tag: Drop-Off. Provide a reason for your classification. Then, outline the user journey step-by-step. Format your response as follows: Tag: your decision [Reason]. 1) [Step 1] 2) [Step 2] 3) [Step 3] … At the end, check if you considered all the logs to the end. Don’t guess or presume."
==================================================

Tag: Drop-Off [Reason: The session shows an initiated task related to form submission that was not completed due to missing required fields and lack of final confirmation.]

1) [User navigated to the menu page by clicking on the "Menu" link.]
2) [User interacted with the form by clicking on various input fields multiple times.]
3) [User changed input in a number field, entering a value of "0.04".]
4) [User clicked the "Save Changes" button, which initiated a form submission.]
5) [Form submission was attempted, but it seems the task was not completed successfully due to missing required fields ("isAvailable": false) as indicated in the form submission log.]

After reviewing all logs, the session indicates that the user did not successfully complete the task initiated (form submission), resulting in a drop-off.
