Prompt: "Analyze the log file. Determine if the session was a drop-off or a conversion. Do not make a decision until you read all the logs. Consider every initiated task and both of the following conditions in your decision-making. If all initiated tasks are completed → Tag: Conversion. Even if one of the initiated tasks is abandoned → Tag: Drop-Off. Provide a reason for your classification. Then, outline the user journey step-by-step. Format your response as follows: Tag: your decision [Reason]. 1) [Step 1] 2) [Step 2] 3) [Step 3] … At the end, check if you considered all the logs to the end. Don’t guess or presume."
==================================================

**Tag: Drop-Off [Reason: An initiated task, namely checking orders via `/api/orders/`, was not completed, indicating a drop-off.]**

1) **[Step 1]** The user starts at the login page and interacts with the username input field, typing "User1" and submitting the form (`/restaurant/login`).
2) **[Step 2]** A successful login request is logged (`/api/login`), suggesting the user has logged in.
3) **[Step 3]** The user navigates to the dashboard and clicks on a profile link (`/restaurant/dashboard/profile`).
4) **[Step 4]** The user makes changes to their profile (input changes and scroll actions).
5) **[Step 5]** The user attempts to view orders (`/api/orders/`), but there is no completion log for this request, indicating it was abandoned.
6) **[Step 6]** The user logs out (`/api/logout`).

The logs have been reviewed to the end.
