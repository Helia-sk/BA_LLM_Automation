Prompt: "Analyze the log file. Determine if the session was a drop-off or a conversion. Do not make a decision until you read all the logs. Consider every initiated task and both of the following conditions in your decision-making. If all initiated tasks are completed → Tag: Conversion. Even if one of the initiated tasks is abandoned → Tag: Drop-Off. Provide a reason for your classification. Then, outline the user journey step-by-step. Format your response as follows: Tag: your decision [Reason]. 1) [Step 1] 2) [Step 2] 3) [Step 3] … At the end, check if you considered all the logs to the end. Don’t guess or presume."
==================================================

Tag: Drop-Off [Reason: There is evidence of an abandoned initiated task as the session involves logging in, viewing orders, and logging out without completing any transactional or conversion action like placing an order.]

1) The user navigated to the login page (`/restaurant/login`), clicked on input fields, and entered credentials.
2) The user submitted the login form and successfully logged in, evidenced by the `/api/login` requests and responses.
3) After logging in, the user navigated through the dashboard (`/restaurant/dashboard`) and accessed the profile page (`/restaurant/dashboard/profile`).
4) The user interacted with the profile page by scrolling, clicking, and changing inputs, but there is no evidence of task completion on this page.
5) The user navigated to view orders (`/api/orders/`), but there is no indication of completing any orders or related transactions.
6) Finally, the user logged out of the session (`/api/logout`).

The session was analyzed to the end. No additional logs were overlooked.
