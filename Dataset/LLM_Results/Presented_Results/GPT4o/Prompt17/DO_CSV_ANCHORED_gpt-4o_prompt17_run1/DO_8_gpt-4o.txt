Even if one of the initiated tasks is abandoned → Tag: Drop-Off. Provide a reason for your classification. Then, outline the user journey step-by-step. Format your response as follows: Tag: your decision [Reason]. 1) [Step 1] 2) [Step 2] 3) [Step 3] … At the end, check if you considered all the logs to the end. Don’t guess or presume."

**User Journey**:
1) **Login Page**: User navigated to the customer login page and entered their username and password. 
2) **Dashboard**: After successful login, the user was directed to the customer dashboard.
3) **Restaurant Selection**: The user browsed through restaurants, specifically looking at "Res_name_1" and "My_res".
4) **Adding Items**: The user added items to their cart from two different restaurants.
5) **Logout**: The user clicked the logout button and logged out of the session.

**Log Analysis Completion**: All logs have been considered until the end. The user's actions indicate that they started a shopping process but did not complete a purchase, instead choosing to logout. Hence, it is tagged as a drop-off.
