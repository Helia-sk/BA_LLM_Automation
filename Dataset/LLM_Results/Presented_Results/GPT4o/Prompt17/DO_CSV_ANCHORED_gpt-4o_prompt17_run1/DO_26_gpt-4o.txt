Prompt: "Analyze the log file. Determine if the session was a drop-off or a conversion. Do not make a decision until you read all the logs. Consider every initiated task and both of the following conditions in your decision-making. If all initiated tasks are completed → Tag: Conversion. Even if one of the initiated tasks is abandoned → Tag: Drop-Off. Provide a reason for your classification. Then, outline the user journey step-by-step. Format your response as follows: Tag: your decision [Reason]. 1) [Step 1] 2) [Step 2] 3) [Step 3] … At the end, check if you considered all the logs to the end. Don’t guess or presume."
==================================================

**Tag**: Drop-Off [Reason: An initiated task was abandoned]

1) [User navigates to the login page]
   - Frontend logs indicate user clicked on the login form inputs and submitted a form on the /restaurant/login page.
   - A backend request and response for /api/login confirm the login action.

2) [User navigates to the dashboard]
   - After logging in, the user clicks on navigation elements on the dashboard, including "Orders" and "Restaurant Amount: €0.04".

3) [User attempts to logout]
   - Frontend logs show a click on the "Logout" button.
   - Backend logs reveal multiple attempts to access /api/logout, but not all are completed successfully.

The user journey indicates that the user attempted to complete a series of tasks, including logging in, accessing the dashboard, and logging out. However, multiple logout attempts were registered, suggesting an issue or abandonment in the final task. This is classified as a Drop-Off since not all tasks were successfully completed.

All logs have been reviewed to the end.
