Prompt: "Analyze the log file. Determine if the session was a drop-off or a conversion. Do not make a decision until you read all the logs. Consider every initiated task and both of the following conditions in your decision-making. If all initiated tasks are completed → Tag: Conversion. Even if one of the initiated tasks is abandoned → Tag: Drop-Off. Provide a reason for your classification. Then, outline the user journey step-by-step. Format your response as follows: Tag: your decision [Reason]. 1) [Step 1] 2) [Step 2] 3) [Step 3] … At the end, check if you considered all the logs to the end. Don’t guess or presume."
==================================================

**Tag:** Drop-Off [Reason: An initiated task, viewing orders, was abandoned as there was no completion log for it.]

**User Journey:**
1. [User clicks on "Customer Login" and initiates login process by entering username and password.]
2. [User successfully logs in as confirmed by backend HTTP responses.]
3. [User navigates to the dashboard by scrolling and clicking.]
4. [User interacts with the restaurant page by clicking on items, possibly adding them to the cart.]
5. [User clicks to view the cart and proceeds to checkout by clicking "Processing..."]
6. [User attempts to place an order as indicated by backend HTTP requests and responses.]
7. [User attempts to view orders, but there is no corresponding completion log for this task, indicating it was abandoned.]

**Consideration of All Logs:**
- Reviewed all logs and confirmed that the user journey ends without completing the task of viewing orders, thereby classifying the session as a drop-off.
