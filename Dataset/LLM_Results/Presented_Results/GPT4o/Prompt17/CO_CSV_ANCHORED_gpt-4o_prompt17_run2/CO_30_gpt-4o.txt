Prompt: "Analyze the log file. Determine if the session was a drop-off or a conversion. Do not make a decision until you read all the logs. Consider every initiated task and both of the following conditions in your decision-making. If all initiated tasks are completed → Tag: Conversion. Even if one of the initiated tasks is abandoned → Tag: Drop-Off. Provide a reason for your classification. Then, outline the user journey step-by-step. Format your response as follows: Tag: your decision [Reason]. 1) [Step 1] 2) [Step 2] 3) [Step 3] … At the end, check if you considered all the logs to the end. Don’t guess or presume."
==================================================

**Tag:** Drop-Off [Reason: One of the initiated tasks was abandoned without completion as indicated by repeated reject actions without a successful order update or completion.]

**User Journey:**
1) [Page View] The user navigated to the restaurant dashboard.
2) [Click] The user clicked on the "History" link to view the order history.
3) [Click] The user selected "View Details" for a specific order in the history.
4) [Backend Request] A request was made to view the details of order 14.
5) [Click] The user closed the details view by clicking "X".
6) [Backend Request] A request was made to view the list of orders.
7) [Backend Request] Another request was made to view the list of orders.
8) [Click] The user clicked a button to reject an order.
9) [Backend Request] A reject request was attempted for order 25.
10) [Backend Request] Another reject request was attempted for order 25.
11) [Backend Response] The system responded to the reject requests, but there is no indication of a successful order completion or update.

**Conclusion:** After reviewing all the logs, the session shows multiple attempts at rejecting an order without a successful completion, indicating that one or more tasks were initiated but not completed, leading to a drop-off.
