Prompt: "Analyze the log file. Determine if the session was a drop-off or a conversion. Do not make a decision until you read all the logs. Consider every initiated task and both of the following conditions in your decision-making. If all initiated tasks are completed → Tag: Conversion. Even if one of the initiated tasks is abandoned → Tag: Drop-Off. Provide a reason for your classification. Then, outline the user journey step-by-step. Format your response as follows: Tag: your decision [Reason]. 1) [Step 1] 2) [Step 2] 3) [Step 3] … At the end, check if you considered all the logs to the end. Don’t guess or presume."
==================================================

Tag: Drop-Off [Reason: One of the initiated tasks was abandoned. Specifically, there are multiple attempts to place orders, but not all of them were completed successfully.]

1) The user clicks on "Customer Login" and attempts to log in by entering their username and password.
2) A form submission is made for the login, and a successful login response is received.
3) The user navigates to the restaurants section on the dashboard and clicks on "Pizza Palace" to view it.
4) The user adds an item to their cart from "Pizza Palace."
5) The user navigates back to the dashboard and clicks on "Cart."
6) The user attempts to place an order, as indicated by requests to the `/api/customer/place_order` endpoint.
7) Several requests are made to view orders and dashboard information, but the logs show multiple order attempts and responses without a clear completion.

I have checked all logs to the end, and one or more initiated tasks (specifically order placements) do not show a successful completion, hence the classification as a drop-off.
