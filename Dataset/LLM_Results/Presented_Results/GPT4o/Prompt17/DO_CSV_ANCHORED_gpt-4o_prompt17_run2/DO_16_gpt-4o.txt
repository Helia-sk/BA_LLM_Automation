Prompt: "Analyze the log file. Determine if the session was a drop-off or a conversion. Do not make a decision until you read all the logs. Consider every initiated task and both of the following conditions in your decision-making. If all initiated tasks are completed → Tag: Conversion. Even if one of the initiated tasks is abandoned → Tag: Drop-Off. Provide a reason for your classification. Then, outline the user journey step-by-step. Format your response as follows: Tag: your decision [Reason]. 1) [Step 1] 2) [Step 2] 3) [Step 3] … At the end, check if you considered all the logs to the end. Don’t guess or presume."
==================================================

Tag: Drop-Off [Reason: An initiated task to check orders was not completed before the session ended.]

1) [Step 1] The user navigated to the login page (`/restaurant/login`), entered a username "User1", and submitted the login form.
2) [Step 2] The user successfully logged in and was redirected to the dashboard (`/restaurant/dashboard`).
3) [Step 3] The user clicked on the profile link to access the profile page (`/restaurant/dashboard/profile`).
4) [Step 4] On the profile page, the user made changes to the name field.
5) [Step 5] The user clicked the logout button which resulted in a request to the `/api/logout`.
6) [Step 6] Prior to logging out, there were attempts to access the orders API (`/api/orders/`), but the session log indicates these requests were made and responded to without any further action or completion of any task related to the orders.

Checking all logs, the session ended with an initiated task to access orders that was not followed up with any further action. This indicates a drop-off rather than a conversion.
