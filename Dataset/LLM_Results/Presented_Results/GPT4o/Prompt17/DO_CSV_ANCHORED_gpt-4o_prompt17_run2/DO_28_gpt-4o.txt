Prompt: "Analyze the log file. Determine if the session was a drop-off or a conversion. Do not make a decision until you read all the logs. Consider every initiated task and both of the following conditions in your decision-making. If all initiated tasks are completed → Tag: Conversion. Even if one of the initiated tasks is abandoned → Tag: Drop-Off. Provide a reason for your classification. Then, outline the user journey step-by-step. Format your response as follows: Tag: your decision [Reason]. 1) [Step 1] 2) [Step 2] 3) [Step 3] … At the end, check if you considered all the logs to the end. Don’t guess or presume."
==================================================

Tag: Drop-Off [Reason: One of the initiated tasks, specifically the "/api/orders" request, was abandoned as there was no corresponding response recorded for an initiated request, indicating it was not completed.]

User Journey:
1) The user navigated to the "/restaurant/dashboard" and clicked on the "Orders" button.
2) The user then clicked on the "Settings" button, navigating to "/restaurant/dashboard/settings".
3) Multiple interactions occurred on the Settings page, including clicks and input changes, particularly involving time input and select dropdowns.
4) The user submitted changes on the settings page, as indicated by the form submission event.
5) The user navigated back to the "Orders" section, as indicated by HTTP requests to "/api/orders".
6) However, one of the orders-related requests did not have a corresponding response, indicating an abandoned task.

All logs have been considered to ensure an accurate classification.
