Prompt: "Analyze the log file. Determine if the session was a drop-off or a conversion. Do not make a decision until you read all the logs.

Even if one of the initiated tasks is abandoned → Tag: Drop-Off. Provide a reason for your classification. Then, outline the user journey step-by-step. Format your response as follows: Tag: your decision [Reason]. 1) [Step 1] 2) [Step 2] 3) [Step 3] … At the end, check if you considered all the logs to the end. Don’t guess or presume."

1) **Login Attempt**: The user clicked on "Customer Login" and entered login details (username and password) and submitted the form. The login was successful as indicated by the `http_response` with status code 200 for the endpoint `/api/customer/login`.

3) **Place Order**: The user initiated an order placement by clicking the "Processing..." button on the cart page. The order was successfully placed as indicated by the `http_response` with status code 201 for the endpoint `/api/customer/place_order`.

4) **Order History and Customer Orders**: The user then checked the order history and customer orders. Both requests were successful as indicated by the `http_response` with status code 200 for endpoints `/api/customer/dashboard/orders/` and `/api/customer/orders/`.
