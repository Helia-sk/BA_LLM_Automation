Prompt: "Analyze the log file. Determine if the session was a drop-off or a conversion. Do not make a decision until you read all the logs. Consider every initiated task and both of the following conditions in your decision-making. If all initiated tasks are completed → Tag: Conversion. Even if one of the initiated tasks is abandoned → Tag: Drop-Off. Provide a reason for your classification. Then, outline the user journey step-by-step. Format your response as follows: Tag: your decision [Reason]. 1) [Step 1] 2) [Step 2] 3) [Step 3] … At the end, check if you considered all the logs to the end. Don’t guess or presume."
==================================================

Tag: Conversion [Reason: All initiated tasks were completed successfully, as indicated by the POST request to add a menu item and the corresponding 201 status code response, which signifies successful creation.]

1) [Step 1] The user navigates to the menu page by clicking on the "Menu" link.
2) [Step 2] The user clicks on the "Add Item" button to add a new menu item.
