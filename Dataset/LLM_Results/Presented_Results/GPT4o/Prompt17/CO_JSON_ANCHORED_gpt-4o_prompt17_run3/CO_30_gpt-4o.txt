Prompt: "Analyze the log file. Determine if the session was a drop-off or a conversion. Do not make a decision until you read all the logs. Consider every initiated task and both of the following conditions in your decision-making. If all initiated tasks are completed → Tag: Conversion. Even if one of the initiated tasks is abandoned → Tag: Drop-Off. Provide a reason for your classification. Then, outline the user journey step-by-step. Format your response as follows: Tag: your decision [Reason]. 1) [Step 1] 2) [Step 2] 3) [Step 3] … At the end, check if you considered all the logs to the end. Don’t guess or presume."
==================================================

Tag: Drop-Off [Reason: One of the initiated tasks, "orders.reject_order", was completed, but no subsequent tasks were initiated or completed that would indicate a conversion. The session primarily involved rejecting an order, which does not constitute a conversion.]

1) [Step 1] Page view of the restaurant dashboard is initiated.
2) [Step 2] User navigates to the "History" section by clicking the "History" button.
3) [Step 3] User views order details by clicking "View Details" in the history section.
4) [Step 4] User closes the "View Details" modal by clicking the "X" button.
5) [Step 5] User initiates an order rejection by clicking the "Reject" button on the dashboard.
6) [Step 6] An HTTP OPTIONS request is made to the endpoint "/api/orders/25/reject" to check available request methods.
7) [Step 7] A successful HTTP POST request is made to the endpoint "/api/orders/25/reject" to reject the order, receiving a status code of 200, indicating completion of the rejection task.

All logs have been considered, and the session does not include any conversion-related tasks beyond the rejection of an order.
