Prompt: "Analyze the log file. Determine if the session was a drop-off or a conversion. Do not make a decision until you read all the logs. Consider every initiated task and both of the following conditions in your decision-making. If all initiated tasks are completed → Tag: Conversion. Even if one of the initiated tasks is abandoned → Tag: Drop-Off. Provide a reason for your classification. Then, outline the user journey step-by-step. Format your response as follows: Tag: your decision [Reason]. 1) [Step 1] 2) [Step 2] 3) [Step 3] … At the end, check if you considered all the logs to the end. Don’t guess or presume."
==================================================

Tag: Drop-Off [Reason: The user initiated multiple tasks, including logging in and logging out, but the task of adding items to the cart was not completed with a purchase or checkout process. The user journey shows interactions with the cart without a final conversion.]

1) [User clicked "Customer Login" and submitted the login form]
2) [Backend POST request to /api/customer/login was successful with status code 200]
3) [User navigated to different restaurant pages and added items to the cart]
4) [User navigated to the cart page]
5) [User clicked "Logout" button on the cart page]
6) [Backend POST request to /api/logout was successful with status code 200]

All log entries have been considered to the end. There is no evidence of a checkout or purchase process, indicating a drop-off in the user journey.
