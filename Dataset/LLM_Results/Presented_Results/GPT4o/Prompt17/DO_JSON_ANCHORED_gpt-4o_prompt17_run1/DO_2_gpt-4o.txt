Prompt: "Analyze the log file. Determine if the session was a drop-off or a conversion. Do not make a decision until you read all the logs. Consider every initiated task and both of the following conditions in your decision-making. If all initiated tasks are completed → Tag: Conversion. Even if one of the initiated tasks is abandoned → Tag: Drop-Off. Provide a reason for your classification. Then, outline the user journey step-by-step. Format your response as follows: Tag: your decision [Reason]. 1) [Step 1] 2) [Step 2] 3) [Step 3] … At the end, check if you considered all the logs to the end. Don’t guess or presume."
==================================================

Tag: Drop-Off [Reason: The session contains two initiated tasks: clicking on "Customer Login" and "Restaurant Login." Neither of these tasks is completed as there are no further logs indicating successful login or continuation beyond the login page.]

1) [Step 1] User visits the homepage and scrolls slightly (scroll event at "http://localhost:5173/").
2) [Step 2] User continues to scroll on the homepage (scroll event at "http://localhost:5173/").
3) [Step 3] User clicks on "Customer Login" (click event at "http://localhost:5173/customer/login").
4) [Step 4] User clicks on "Restaurant Login" (click event at "http://localhost:5173/restaurant/login").

All logs have been considered, and no further actions are recorded beyond the clicks on the login options, indicating that the tasks were not completed.
