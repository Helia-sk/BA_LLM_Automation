Prompt: "Analyze the log file. Determine if the session was a drop-off or a conversion. Do not make a decision until you read all the logs. Consider every initiated task and both of the following conditions in your decision-making. If all initiated tasks are completed → Tag: Conversion. Even if one of the initiated tasks is abandoned → Tag: Drop-Off. Provide a reason for your classification. Then, outline the user journey step-by-step. Format your response as follows: Tag: your decision [Reason]. 1) [Step 1] 2) [Step 2] 3) [Step 3] … At the end, check if you considered all the logs to the end. Don’t guess or presume."
==================================================

Tag: Conversion [Reason: All initiated tasks were completed successfully within the session, specifically the login and logout processes. There were no abandoned tasks.]

1) User navigated to the login page (`http://localhost:5173/restaurant/login`) and clicked to enter the username field.
2) User entered the username "User1" and proceeded to the password field.
3) User entered a password and submitted the login form. The backend processed the login request resulting in a successful login (HTTP 200).
4) User navigated to the dashboard and clicked on "History" to view order details.
5) User clicked "View Details" to see specific order details, which were successfully retrieved (HTTP 200).
6) User closed the details view by clicking the "X" button.
7) User clicked "Logout" and the system processed the logout request successfully (HTTP 200).

All steps are accounted for, and all initiated tasks (login, viewing orders, and logout) were completed successfully, confirming the session as a conversion.
