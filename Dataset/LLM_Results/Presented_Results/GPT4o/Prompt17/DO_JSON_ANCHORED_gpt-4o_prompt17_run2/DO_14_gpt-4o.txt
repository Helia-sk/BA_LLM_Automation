Prompt: "Analyze the log file. Determine if the session was a drop-off or a conversion. Do not make a decision until you read all the logs. Consider every initiated task and both of the following conditions in your decision-making. If all initiated tasks are completed → Tag: Conversion. Even if one of the initiated tasks is abandoned → Tag: Drop-Off. Provide a reason for your classification. Then, outline the user journey step-by-step. Format your response as follows: Tag: your decision [Reason]. 1) [Step 1] 2) [Step 2] 3) [Step 3] … At the end, check if you considered all the logs to the end. Don’t guess or presume."
==================================================

Tag: Drop-Off [Reason: The initiated login task was abandoned as there is no evidence of form submission or navigation to a different page after entering username and password.]

User Journey:
1) [Step 1] User clicked on "Restaurant Login" link to navigate to the login page.
2) [Step 2] User clicked on the username input field.
3) [Step 3] User typed "dd" into the username field (captured twice: debounced input and blur).
4) [Step 4] User clicked on the password input field.
5) [Step 5] User entered a password (captured twice: debounced input and blur).
6) [Step 6] User clicked on "Lieferspatz" element, which seems unrelated to completing the login.

I have reviewed all the logs to ensure no further actions were taken that indicate task completion.
