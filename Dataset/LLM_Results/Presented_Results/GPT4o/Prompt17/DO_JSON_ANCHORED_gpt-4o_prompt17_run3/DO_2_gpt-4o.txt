Prompt: "Analyze the log file. Determine if the session was a drop-off or a conversion. Do not make a decision until you read all the logs. Consider every initiated task and both of the following conditions in your decision-making. If all initiated tasks are completed → Tag: Conversion. Even if one of the initiated tasks is abandoned → Tag: Drop-Off. Provide a reason for your classification. Then, outline the user journey step-by-step. Format your response as follows: Tag: your decision [Reason]. 1) [Step 1] 2) [Step 2] 3) [Step 3] … At the end, check if you considered all the logs to the end. Don’t guess or presume."
==================================================

**Tag**: Drop-Off [Reason: The session included attempts to access both "Restaurant Login" and "Customer Login" but there is no indication that either login was completed. No tasks were confirmed as completed.]

1. [Step 1] User scrolls on the homepage (URL: http://localhost:5173/).
2. [Step 2] User continues scrolling on the homepage.
3. [Step 3] User clicks on "Customer Login" (URL: http://localhost:5173/customer/login).
4. [Step 4] User clicks on "Restaurant Login" (URL: http://localhost:5173/restaurant/login).

**Consideration**: All logs have been reviewed to the end. There is no evidence of task completion, such as successful login or further navigation after login attempts, thus classifying the session as a Drop-Off.
