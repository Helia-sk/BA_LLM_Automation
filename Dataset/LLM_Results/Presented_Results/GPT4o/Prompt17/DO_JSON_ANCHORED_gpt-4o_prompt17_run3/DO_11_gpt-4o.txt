Prompt: "Analyze the log file. Determine if the session was a drop-off or a conversion. Do not make a decision until you read all the logs. Consider every initiated task and both of the following conditions in your decision-making. If all initiated tasks are completed → Tag: Conversion. Even if one of the initiated tasks is abandoned → Tag: Drop-Off. Provide a reason for your classification. Then, outline the user journey step-by-step. Format your response as follows: Tag: your decision [Reason]. 1) [Step 1] 2) [Step 2] 3) [Step 3] … At the end, check if you considered all the logs to the end. Don’t guess or presume."
==================================================

Tag: Drop-Off [Reason: The session initiated tasks related to logging in, viewing customer orders, and logging out. While the login and order viewing tasks were completed, the logout process wasn't fully completed as indicated by the sequence of logs. The logout request was initiated, but since the logout is a critical task that wasn't completed successfully, this session is considered a drop-off.]

1) [Step 1] User clicks on "Customer Login" and navigates to the login page.
2) [Step 2] User enters the username "User1".
3) [Step 3] User enters a password and submits the login form.
4) [Step 4] Backend logs confirm a successful login via a POST request to `/api/customer/login`.
5) [Step 5] User navigates through the dashboard, scrolling and clicking through different sections such as restaurants and orders.
6) [Step 6] User requests to view customer orders, which is successfully completed as confirmed by the GET request to `/api/customer/orders/`.
7) [Step 7] User clicks on "Logout" to initiate the logout process.
8) [Step 8] An OPTIONS request is made to `/api/logout`, followed by a POST request, indicating an attempt to log out.
9) [Step 9] Although a POST request to `/api/logout` is logged with a 200 status code, the sequence of logs and the importance of the logout task suggest the session did not conclude with a proper logout.

Check: All logs have been considered up to the end.
