Prompt: "Analyze the log file. Determine if the session was a drop-off or a conversion. Do not make a decision until you read all the logs. Consider every initiated task and both of the following conditions in your decision-making. If all initiated tasks are completed → Tag: Conversion. Even if one of the initiated tasks is abandoned → Tag: Drop-Off. Provide a reason for your classification. Then, outline the user journey step-by-step. Format your response as follows: Tag: your decision [Reason]. 1) [Step 1] 2) [Step 2] 3) [Step 3] … At the end, check if you considered all the logs to the end. Don’t guess or presume."
==================================================

Tag: Drop-Off [Reason: An initiated task was abandoned as indicated by multiple reject requests.]

1) The user lands on the restaurant dashboard page as seen in the page view event.
2) The user clicks on the "History" link to view order history.
3) The user clicks "View Details" on an order in the history.
4) The user clicks a button with "X" to potentially close a modal or cancel an action.
5) The user clicks a non-interactive area (SVG icon), possibly navigating within the dashboard.
6) The user clicks the "Reject" button, which triggers multiple backend requests to reject an order.
7) Multiple backend requests to reject an order are made, indicating a possible retry or multiple attempts to complete the action. However, the presence of multiple reject requests suggests that the task was not completed successfully in one go, indicating a drop-off.

All logs were considered to the end, and a decision was made based on the presence of multiple reject requests, suggesting that the task was not completed as intended.
