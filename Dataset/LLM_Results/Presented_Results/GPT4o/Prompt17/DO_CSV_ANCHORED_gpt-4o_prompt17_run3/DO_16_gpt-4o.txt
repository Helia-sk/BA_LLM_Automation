Prompt: "Analyze the log file. Determine if the session was a drop-off or a conversion. Do not make a decision until you read all the logs. Consider every initiated task and both of the following conditions in your decision-making. If all initiated tasks are completed → Tag: Conversion. Even if one of the initiated tasks is abandoned → Tag: Drop-Off. Provide a reason for your classification. Then, outline the user journey step-by-step. Format your response as follows: Tag: your decision [Reason]. 1) [Step 1] 2) [Step 2] 3) [Step 3] … At the end, check if you considered all the logs to the end. Don’t guess or presume."
==================================================

**Tag**: Drop-Off [Reason: The session indicates that the user initiated an order retrieval task by accessing `/api/orders/`, but there is no evidence of any further action to complete an order, such as a purchase or checkout. Therefore, the session did not result in a conversion.]

**User Journey:**

1) **Login Attempt**
   - User interacts with the login page by entering the username and password.
   - A form submission event for login is recorded, indicating a login attempt.

2) **Successful Login**
   - The backend logs show a successful login request and response.

3) **Access Orders**
   - User accesses the orders page, initiating a task to possibly view past or pending orders.

4) **Logout**
   - User logs out, as indicated by the `/api/logout` requests and responses.

**Consideration of All Logs:**
- All logs have been thoroughly analyzed from the login process, interaction with the orders page, and eventual logout without any conversion action. Therefore, the session is tagged as a drop-off due to the incomplete task related to conversion.
