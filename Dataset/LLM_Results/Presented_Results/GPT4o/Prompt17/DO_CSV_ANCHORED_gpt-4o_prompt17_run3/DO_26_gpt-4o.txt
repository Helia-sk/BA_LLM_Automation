Prompt: "Analyze the log file. Determine if the session was a drop-off or a conversion. Do not make a decision until you read all the logs. Consider every initiated task and both of the following conditions in your decision-making. If all initiated tasks are completed → Tag: Conversion. Even if one of the initiated tasks is abandoned → Tag: Drop-Off. Provide a reason for your classification. Then, outline the user journey step-by-step. Format your response as follows: Tag: your decision [Reason]. 1) [Step 1] 2) [Step 2] 3) [Step 3] … At the end, check if you considered all the logs to the end. Don’t guess or presume."
==================================================

Tag: Drop-Off [Reason: The user initiated a task related to viewing orders, but there is no evidence that the user actually interacted with or completed any order-related actions beyond accessing the orders page. The session ends with a logout request, indicating an abandonment of any potential task related to order management.]

1) User navigates to the login page and fills in the username and password fields.
2) User submits the login form.
3) Backend logs confirm a successful login via the `/api/login` route.
4) User navigates to the restaurant dashboard.
5) User clicks on the "Orders" button to view orders.
6) Backend logs show two requests to the `/api/orders/` endpoint, suggesting the user accessed the orders page.
7) User clicks on "Restaurant Amount: €0.04" on the dashboard, possibly checking financial details.
8) User logs out of the session, as evidenced by clicks on the "Logout" button and the associated backend `/api/logout` request and response.

I have considered all the logs to the end.
