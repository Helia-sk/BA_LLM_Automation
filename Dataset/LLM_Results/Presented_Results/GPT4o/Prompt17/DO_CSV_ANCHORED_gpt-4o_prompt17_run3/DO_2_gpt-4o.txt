2) [Click on "Customer Login"] - The user clicks on the "Customer Login" link, indicating an intention to log in as a customer.
3) [Click on "Restaurant Login"] - The user then clicks on the "Restaurant Login" link, indicating a change in intention or interest in logging in as a restaurant.

All logs have been considered to the end, and no further actions or completions of tasks were recorded after the clicks on login links.
