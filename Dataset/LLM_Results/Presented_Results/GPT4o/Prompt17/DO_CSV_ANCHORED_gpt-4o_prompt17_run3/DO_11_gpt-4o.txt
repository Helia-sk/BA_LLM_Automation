Prompt: "Analyze the log file. Determine if the session was a drop-off or a conversion. Do not make a decision until you read all the logs. Consider every initiated task and both of the following conditions in your decision-making. If all initiated tasks are completed → Tag: Conversion. Even if one of the initiated tasks is abandoned → Tag: Drop-Off. Provide a reason for your classification. Then, outline the user journey step-by-step. Format your response as follows: Tag: your decision [Reason]. 1) [Step 1] 2) [Step 2] 3) [Step 3] … At the end, check if you considered all the logs to the end. Don’t guess or presume."
==================================================

**Tag**: Drop-Off [Reason: There was an initiated task to view customer orders, but it was abandoned as the session ended with a logout without completing any purchase.]

**User Journey:**

1) **Login Attempt**: User navigates to the login page, fills in the username "User1", and submits the login form.
2) **Login Success**: Backend logs confirm the login request and response.
3) **Dashboard Navigation**: User navigates through the customer dashboard.
4) **Restaurant Browsing**: User clicks on restaurants and interacts with restaurant pages, possibly adding items.
5) **View Orders**: User tries to view their orders by navigating to the orders section.
6) **Logout**: User clicks the logout button and logs out of the session.

The journey shows that while the user initiated viewing orders, they did not complete any purchase or task related to it before logging out, indicating a drop-off.

All logs have been considered up to the last entry, and no initiated tasks were completed fully, leading to a drop-off classification.
