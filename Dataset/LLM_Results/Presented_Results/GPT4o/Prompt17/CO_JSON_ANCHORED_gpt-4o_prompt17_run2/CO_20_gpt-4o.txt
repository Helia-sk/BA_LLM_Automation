1) [Step 1] The user navigated to the login page and filled in the username field with "User1". They then clicked on the password field and entered a password. This was followed by clicking the "Sign In" button and submitting the login form. The login attempt was successful, as indicated by the subsequent HTTP response with a status code of 200.
