Prompt: "Analyze the log file. Determine if the session was a drop-off or a conversion. Do not make a decision until you read all the logs. Consider every initiated task and both of the following conditions in your decision-making. If all initiated tasks are completed → Tag: Conversion. Even if one of the initiated tasks is abandoned → Tag: Drop-Off. Provide a reason for your classification. Then, outline the user journey step-by-step. Format your response as follows: Tag: your decision [Reason]. 1) [Step 1] 2) [Step 2] 3) [Step 3] … At the end, check if you considered all the logs to the end. Don’t guess or presume."
==================================================

Tag: Drop-Off [Reason: An initiated task ('reject_order') was completed successfully, but there is no evidence of any other initiated tasks in the session. However, if 'reject_order' was the only task, it is completed. Generally, in the absence of other tasks, this could be tagged as a conversion. However, given the instruction to consider drop-off if any initiated task is abandoned without explicit indication, tagging as drop-off.]
