==================================================

Tag: Drop-off [Reason: The session does not show any clear conversion event such as a purchase or sign-up completion; it primarily consists of interactions with the menu page without further engagement indicative of a conversion.]

1) [Step 1: The session begins with a click event on the "Menu" link, indicating the user's initial interaction with the restaurant dashboard menu page.]
2) [Step 2: The user scrolls the menu page, which suggests browsing through the available menu options.]
3) [Step 3: Another click event is logged, but it is a click on an SVG element with no further details, indicating potential exploration but not a conversion.]
4) [Step 4: Multiple backend HTTP requests and responses are logged for the menu API, indicating the retrieval of menu information, but no subsequent actions are taken that would suggest a conversion.]
