==================================================

Tag: Drop-off [The session did not lead to a successful order placement or clear conversion activity.]

1) The session begins with a series of frontend events indicating a user attempting to log in on a restaurant login page. The user inputs a username and password and clicks the "Sign In" button.

2) Subsequent backend events show HTTP requests and responses related to the login and order API endpoints. However, the sequence does not end with any clear indication of a successful order placement or conversion activity.

3) No definitive interaction post login or order confirmation is present, suggesting the session ended without achieving a conversion goal.
