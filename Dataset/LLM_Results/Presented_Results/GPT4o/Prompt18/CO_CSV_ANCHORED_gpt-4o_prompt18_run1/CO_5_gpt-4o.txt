==================================================

Tag: Conversion [The session includes a successful login and multiple actions indicating a completed order process, followed by a logout action.]

1) [Step 1: User logs in] 
   - User navigates to the login page and successfully submits the login form.
   - Evidence: Frontend log "form_submit.v2" for the login page followed by corresponding backend logs for login requests and responses.

2) [Step 2: User places an order]
   - User navigates through the dashboard, adds items to the cart, and proceeds to place an order.
   - Evidence: Backend logs indicating requests and responses to the "/api/customer/place_order" endpoint, along with frontend logs showing interactions with the cart and processing actions.

3) [Step 3: User logs out]
   - User navigates to logout, indicating the end of their session.
   - Evidence: Backend logs for "/api/logout" requests and responses, along with frontend click logs on the logout button.

The sequence of actions suggests that the user completed a transaction, indicating a conversion rather than a drop-off.
