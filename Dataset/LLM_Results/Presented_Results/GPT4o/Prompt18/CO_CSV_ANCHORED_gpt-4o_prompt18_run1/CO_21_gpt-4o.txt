==================================================

Tag: Drop-off [The session ended with a logout without a meaningful conversion action.]

1) **Page View**: The session begins with a page view on the homepage ("/").
   
2) **Navigation to Login**: The user clicks on a link for "Restaurant Partners" and navigates to the login page ("/restaurant/login").

3) **Login Attempt**: The user enters their username and password on the login page and submits the login form.

4) **Profile Page Interaction**: After a successful login, the user navigates to their profile page ("/restaurant/dashboard/profile"), makes some input changes, and submits a form to save changes.

5) **Logout**: The session concludes with a logout action, as indicated by the click event on the "Logout" button and the subsequent API request to "/api/logout".

Despite the profile updates, the session ends with a logout, and there is no indication of a purchase or other conversion action, leading to the determination of a drop-off.
