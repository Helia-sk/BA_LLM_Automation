==================================================

Tag: Conversion [The session includes a successful login and an attempt to place an order, which suggests a conversion rather than a drop-off.]

1) **Login Process:** 
   - The session begins with a series of interactions related to logging in. The user enters a username and password, submits the login form, and receives a successful login response.
   
2) **Order Interaction:**
   - After logging in, the user interacts with their dashboard, views order details, and navigates to the cart.
   - The user clicks on "View Details" and "Cart" buttons, indicating interest in their order and potential purchase.
   
3) **Order Placement:**
   - The session continues with the user making a request to place an order (`/api/customer/place_order`), followed by a response, indicating the order placement process was initiated.

Overall, these steps indicate the user successfully logged in and attempted to place an order, which are key indicators of a conversion.
