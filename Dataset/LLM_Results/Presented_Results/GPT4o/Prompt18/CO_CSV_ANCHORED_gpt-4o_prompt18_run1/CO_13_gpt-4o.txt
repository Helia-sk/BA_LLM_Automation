==================================================

Tag: Conversion [The session includes a backend API request to complete an order, indicating a successful transaction.]

1) A series of backend `http_request` and `http_response` events leading up to the `/api/orders/21/complete` endpoint suggest that an order completion process was initiated and successfully completed.
2) The frontend logs show user interaction with the dashboard, including clicks on "View Details" and "Done," which might correlate with reviewing and finalizing an order.
3) The presence of the `/api/orders/21/details` endpoint in the log could indicate that the user reviewed the order details before completion.
4) The sequence of events and endpoints accessed aligns with typical conversion behavior involving order processing and completion.
