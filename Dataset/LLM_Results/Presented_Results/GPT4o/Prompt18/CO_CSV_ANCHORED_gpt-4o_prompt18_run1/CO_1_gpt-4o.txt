==================================================

Tag: Drop-off [Reason: The session did not complete the login process successfully due to missing password input.]

1) [Step 1: The user clicked on the "Customer Login" option, which indicates an intention to login.]
2) [Step 2: The user clicked on the username input field and entered the username "User1".]
3) [Step 3: The user clicked on the password input field and started entering a password, but only one character was registered.]
4) [Step 4: The user clicked the "Sign In" button, submitting the form.]
5) [Step 5: The backend received a login request and responded, but the details do not indicate a successful login conversion. Specifically, the password length was 0, suggesting the password was not correctly entered or captured during the submission process.]
