==================================================

Tag: Drop-off [The session ended without any indication of a successful conversion or completion of a meaningful process, such as a purchase or registration.]

1) [The session involved multiple interactions on the login page, including form inputs and clicks, suggesting an attempt to log in or register.]
2) [However, there is no evidence in the logs of a successful login or registration event, such as a confirmation response or redirection to a dashboard.]
3) [The latest logged event is a scroll on the dashboard, which implies the user was browsing but did not complete any conversion-related action.]
4) [Backend logs show API requests related to orders and registration, but these are not directly linked to the frontend session, and no successful transaction or registration confirmation is evident.]
