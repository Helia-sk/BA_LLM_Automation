==================================================

Tag: Conversion [The session indicates successful engagement and action completion by the user, transitioning from login to logout.]

1) [Step 1: User Interaction] The session begins with user interaction on the login page where the user fills in the username and password fields, clicks the "Sign In" button, and submits the login form. This is captured by multiple "input_change" and "click" events logged at timestamps around "2025-09-13T11:54:08.000Z" to "2025-09-13T11:54:10.000Z".

2) [Step 2: Successful Login] The backend logs a successful login attempt with a "POST" request to the "/api/customer/login" endpoint, receiving a 200 status code, indicating a successful login. This event is logged at "2025-09-13T13:54:10.974056".

3) [Step 3: Dashboard Navigation] The user navigates through the dashboard, interacting with various elements such as clicking on "Restaurants", "Cart", and adding items, as evidenced by "click" and "scroll" events around "2025-09-13T11:54:20.000Z" to "2025-09-13T11:54:35.000Z".

4) [Step 4: Logout] The user eventually clicks the "Logout" button, which generates a "click" event at "2025-09-13T11:54:39.852Z". This action is followed by a backend "POST" request to the "/api/logout" endpoint, resulting in a 200 status code, indicating a successful logout as recorded at "2025-09-13T13:54:40.507064".

The sequence of events shows that the user successfully logged in, interacted with the application, and logged out, completing a full session cycle, hence marking it as a conversion.
