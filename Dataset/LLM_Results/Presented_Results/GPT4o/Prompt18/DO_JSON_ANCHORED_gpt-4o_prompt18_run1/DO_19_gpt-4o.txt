==================================================

**Tag: Conversion [Reason: The session shows a successful login followed by successful API requests, and ends with a logout, indicating a complete user session from login to logout.]**

1) [Step 1: Login] - The user initiates a login process, as evidenced by the `login.login` endpoint. The login process includes input events for username and password, and culminates in a successful HTTP POST request with a 200 response status code at the `/api/login` endpoint.
2) [Step 2: API Requests] - After logging in, the user makes GET requests to the `/api/orders/` endpoint (as seen in the `orders.get_orders` events), which are completed successfully with a 200 response status code. This indicates that the user is interacting with the application to view order details.
3) [Step 3: Logout] - The session concludes with a logout action. A click event on a "Logout" button is captured, followed by a successful HTTP POST request to the `/api/logout` endpoint with a 200 response status code.

This sequence of events indicates a complete session where the user logs in, interacts with the application, and then logs out, thus constituting a conversion rather than a drop-off.
