==================================================

Tag: Drop-off [Reason: The session consists of navigation events without any form submission or successful login, indicating that the user did not complete a conversion action.]

1) [Step 1: The session starts with a scroll event on the homepage, indicating user interaction but no conversion action.]
2) [Step 2: Another scroll event occurs, showing continued browsing but still no conversion action.]
3) [Step 3: A click event on the "Customer Login" link suggests an intention to log in, but there is no subsequent login submission or success recorded.]
4) [Step 4: A click event on the "Restaurant Login" link indicates further navigation, yet again, there’s no evidence of a completed login or any form submission.]
