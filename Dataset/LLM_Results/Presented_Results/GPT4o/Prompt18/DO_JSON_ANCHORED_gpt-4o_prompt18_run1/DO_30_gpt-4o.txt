==================================================

Tag: Conversion [The session involves actions that suggest a successful transaction or intended outcome, such as accepting an order followed by a logout, indicating task completion.]
1) [Step 1: The session starts with interactions on the restaurant dashboard menu, including adding items and making input changes.]
2) [Step 2: The user clicks on the "Accept" button on the restaurant dashboard, triggering an order acceptance request to the backend (`orders.accept_order`).]
3) [Step 3: The server responds with a status code of 200, indicating successful acceptance of the order.]
4) [Step 4: The user navigates and interacts with the menu again, possibly reviewing or adding more items.]
5) [Step 5: The user initiates a logout sequence by clicking the "Logout" button, resulting in a successful logout response from the server with a status code of 200.]

This sequence of events, particularly the successful order acceptance followed by a logout, suggests that the session ended with a conversion.
