==================================================

Tag: Conversion [The session appears to be a successful conversion as it ends with a logout action after a series of interactions indicating a completed user journey.]

1) [Step 1: Customer Login]
   - A login attempt is made with a username and password, followed by a successful login indicated by the HTTP response with status code 200 for the `/api/customer/login` endpoint. 
   - Event details include form submission and input changes for username and password fields.

2) [Step 2: Browsing and Adding Items]
   - The user navigates through various sections of the customer dashboard, including visiting restaurants and adding items to the cart. This is reflected in multiple click and scroll events on restaurant pages, order pages, and cart pages.

3) [Step 3: Viewing Orders]
   - The user views the customer orders, shown by the `cus_orders.get_customer_orders` endpoint with a successful HTTP response.

4) [Step 4: Logout]
   - The session concludes with the user logging out, as shown by the `http_request` and `http_response` events for the `/api/logout` endpoint with a status code of 200, indicating a successful logout.

These steps collectively indicate that the user successfully logged into the system, performed actions typical of a conversion (such as adding items and possibly placing an order), and then logged out, completing the session.
