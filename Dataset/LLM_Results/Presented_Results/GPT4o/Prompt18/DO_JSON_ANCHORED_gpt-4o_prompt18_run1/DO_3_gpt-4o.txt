==================================================

Tag: Drop-off [Reason: The session contains multiple input events indicating an attempt to log in but lacks any indication of a successful form submission or redirection to another page, suggesting the user did not complete the login process.]

1) [Step 1: The user clicked on the "Customer Login" link, indicating the start of a login attempt.]
2) [Step 2: The user clicked on the username field and entered text, indicating they began filling out the login form.]
3) [Step 3: The user clicked on the password field and entered text, completing the form fields necessary for login.]
4) [Step 4: The events end after input changes to the password field, with no submission or redirection event logged, implying the user did not complete the login process.]
