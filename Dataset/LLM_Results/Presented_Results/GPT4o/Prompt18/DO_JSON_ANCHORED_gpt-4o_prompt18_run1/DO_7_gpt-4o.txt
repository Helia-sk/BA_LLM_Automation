==================================================

Tag: Conversion [Reason: The session includes a successful login followed by a successful logout, indicating a complete cycle of user engagement.]

1) The user initially interacted with the login page by entering a username and password and submitting the form (`event_name`: `input_change`, `click`, `form_submit` on `/customer/login`).
2) A successful login occurred, as indicated by the `http_response` event with a `status_code` of 200 on the `/api/customer/login` endpoint.
3) The session continues with interactions on the dashboard page, including clicks and scrolls (`event_name`: `click`, `scroll` on `/customer/dashboard/restaurant/3`).
4) The user clicked the logout button, which is followed by a `http_request` and `http_response` with a `status_code` of 200 on the `/api/logout` endpoint, indicating a successful logout.
