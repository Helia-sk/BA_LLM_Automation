2) [Step 2: User submitted the login form]
   - Event: "form_submit" on the login page.
   - Timestamp: "2025-09-13T12:19:07.829Z".
   
3) [Step 3: Successful login response]
   - Event: "http_response" with status code 200 for the login endpoint.
   - Timestamp: "2025-09-13T14:19:08.433436".
   
4) [Step 4: User initiated viewing orders]
   - Event: "http_request" and "http_response" for the orders endpoint.
   - Timestamps: "2025-09-13T14:19:08.808041" and "2025-09-13T14:19:09.080882".
   
5) [Step 5: User logged out]
   - Event: "click" on the "Logout" button, followed by "http_request" and "http_response" for the logout endpoint.
