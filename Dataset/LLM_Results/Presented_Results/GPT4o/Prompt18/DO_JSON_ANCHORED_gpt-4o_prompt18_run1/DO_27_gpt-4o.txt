==================================================

Tag: Conversion [The session ended with a successful logout, which indicates a completed action or goal.]

1) [Step 1: User Login]
   - The user initiated a login request.
   - Log entries indicate a successful login with a `POST` request to `/api/login` (status code 200).

2) [Step 2: User Activity]
   - The user viewed order details and navigated through the order history.
   - Several `GET` requests to `/api/orders/` and `/api/orders/14/details` returned successfully (status code 200).

3) [Step 3: Logout]
   - The user clicked the "Logout" button, triggering a `POST` request to `/api/logout`.
   - The logout request was successful, as indicated by the `http_response` log with status code 200. 

This sequence of actions, from logging in to successfully logging out, constitutes a complete session, ending with a conversion (successful logout).
