==================================================

Tag: Drop-off [The session did not result in a meaningful conversion such as placing an order or completing a transaction. The session primarily involved fetching settings and orders and ended with a logout action.]

1) [The session began with a series of interactions related to logging in, including inputting a username and password, followed by a successful login request (`POST /api/login`) with a 200 status code.]
2) [The session continued with several `GET` requests to retrieve orders and settings such as opening hours and delivery areas. All these requests were successful, indicating the user was likely browsing information.]
3) [The session concluded with a `POST /api/logout` request resulting in a 200 status code, indicating the user logged out without performing any further actions that would constitute a conversion like placing an order.]
