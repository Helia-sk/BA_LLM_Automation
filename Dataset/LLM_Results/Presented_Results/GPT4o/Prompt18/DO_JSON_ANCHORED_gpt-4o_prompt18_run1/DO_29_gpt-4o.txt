2) [Step 2: The user performs actions related to updating menu items, which is evidenced by the HTTP requests and responses for updating menu items with successful status codes (200).]
3) [Step 3: The session concludes with a logout request and response, indicating the user has completed their intended activities and ended the session, which is typical of a conversion where the user has completed their tasks and signed out.]
