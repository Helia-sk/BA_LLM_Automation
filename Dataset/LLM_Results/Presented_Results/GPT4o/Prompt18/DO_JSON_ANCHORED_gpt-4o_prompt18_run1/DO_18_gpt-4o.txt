2) [Step 2: A login attempt is made with a POST request to the /api/login endpoint, which is successful with a 200 status code.]
3) [Step 3: After logging in, the user accesses the orders page twice, as indicated by the GET requests to /api/orders/, both returning successful 200 responses.]
4) [Step 4: The user logs out with a POST request to the /api/logout endpoint, which is also successful with a 200 status code, completing the session.]
