2) The user navigated to the restaurant login page and successfully logged in (indicated by the form submission event).
3) After logging in, the user navigated to the restaurant dashboard and the menu.
4) The user interacted with the menu by clicking inputs and buttons, including an "Add Item" button.
5) However, the session concluded with a "Cancel" button click on the menu page, indicating the user did not proceed with a conversion action such as placing an order.
