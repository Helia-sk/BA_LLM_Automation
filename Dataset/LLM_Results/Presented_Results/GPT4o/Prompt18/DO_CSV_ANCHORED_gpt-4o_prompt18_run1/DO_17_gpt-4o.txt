==================================================

Tag: Drop-off [The session ended with a logout without completing any significant conversion events such as adding to cart, checking out, or making a purchase.]

1) [Step 1: The session began with user interactions on the login page, including entering credentials and submitting the form.]
2) [Step 2: The user successfully logged in and navigated to the profile page on the dashboard.]
3) [Step 3: The user edited a profile description field and clicked the logout button shortly after.]
4) [Step 4: The backend logs confirm a successful logout request and response.]

The sequence of events indicates that the user logged in, viewed the dashboard, edited a profile description, and then logged out without engaging in further actions that would qualify as a conversion.
