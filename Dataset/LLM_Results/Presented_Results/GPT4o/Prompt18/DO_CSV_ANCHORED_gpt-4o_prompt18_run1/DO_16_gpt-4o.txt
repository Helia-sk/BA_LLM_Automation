==================================================

Tag: Drop-off [Reason: The session ends with a logout request, indicating the user left the session without completing a purchase or conversion.]

2) The user successfully logs in and navigates to the profile page, as indicated by clicks and input changes on the profile page.
3) The session involves interactions with the profile page, including input changes and clicks, suggesting the user was updating or reviewing their profile.
4) The session concludes with a logout event, as seen from multiple `/api/logout` requests and responses, showing the user intentionally ended their session without any conversion-related actions like making a purchase.
