==================================================

Tag: Drop-off [Reason: The session involved user interactions primarily around profile and order page activities without any indication of a successful conversion action like completing a purchase. The session concluded with a logout request, suggesting the user did not engage in actions typical of a conversion.]

1) The session starts with a click on "Restaurant Partners" to access a login page.
2) The user enters a username and a password and submits the login form.
3) Successful login is implied as subsequent actions are on a secured dashboard/profile page.
4) The user performs several clicks and scrolls on the profile/dashboard page.
5) The session includes input changes, possibly indicating profile updates, but no significant conversion event like an order placement is evident.
6) The session ends with a click on a "Logout" button, followed by a backend logout request.

Overall, the session shows user engagement on the platform but lacks a clear conversion event.
