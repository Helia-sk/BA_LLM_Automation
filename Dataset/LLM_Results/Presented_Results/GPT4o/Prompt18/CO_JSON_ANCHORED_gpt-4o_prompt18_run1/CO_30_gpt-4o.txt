==================================================

Tag: Drop-off [The session involved rejecting an order, which is not considered a conversion in typical e-commerce or service contexts.]

1) [Step 1: Initial page view] The session started with a page view of the restaurant dashboard at "2025-09-27T15:20:35.792Z".
2) [Step 2: Navigation to history] The user navigated to the history page by clicking on a "History" link or button at "2025-09-27T15:20:43.885Z".
3) [Step 3: Interaction with history page] The user clicked on the "View Details" button on the history page at "2025-09-27T15:20:45.667Z".
4) [Step 4: Viewing order details] The user viewed the details of a specific order, as indicated by the GET request to "/api/orders/14/details" that returned a 200 status code at "2025-09-27T17:20:45.683670".
5) [Step 5: Navigating back to dashboard] The user closed the details view by clicking "X" and returned to the dashboard at "2025-09-27T15:20:49.152Z".
6) [Step 6: Order rejection] The user clicked the "Reject" button on the dashboard at "2025-09-27T15:20:52.428Z", which triggered a POST request to "/api/orders/25/reject" that returned a 200 status code at "2025-09-27T17:20:52.767127".

The sequence of events indicates that the primary action taken was the rejection of an order, which signals a drop-off rather than a conversion.
