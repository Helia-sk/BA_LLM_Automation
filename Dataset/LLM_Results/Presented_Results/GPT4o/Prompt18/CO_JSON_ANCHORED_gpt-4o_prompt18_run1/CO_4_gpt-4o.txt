==================================================

Tag: Conversion [Reason: The session includes a successful user registration followed by order retrieval, indicating user engagement and transaction completion.]

1) [Step 1: User Interaction] The session starts with user interactions on a login form, including form submissions and input changes, suggesting an attempt to either log in or register.
2) [Step 2: Registration] A POST request to the `/api/register` endpoint with a status code of 201 indicates a successful registration event at `2025-09-13T16:15:28.275981`.
3) [Step 3: Order Retrieval] Subsequent GET requests to the `/api/orders/` endpoint with a status code of 200 confirm successful order retrieval at `2025-09-13T16:15:28.679417` and `2025-09-13T16:15:28.956947`.
4) [Conclusion] The sequence of registration followed by order retrieval suggests a conversion, as the user completed a key action (registration) and proceeded to interact with the order system.
