==================================================

Tag: Conversion [Reason: The sequence of logs indicates a successful order acceptance process, as confirmed by the 200 status code in the final HTTP response event.]

1) [Step 1: A click event is logged at "2025-09-27T15:08:34.781Z" on the frontend, indicating a user interaction with the "Accept" button on the dashboard.]
2) [Step 2: An OPTIONS HTTP request is made to the "/api/orders/26/accept" endpoint at "2025-09-27T17:08:34.782990", likely checking the server capabilities.]
3) [Step 3: An OPTIONS HTTP response follows immediately at "2025-09-27T17:08:34.791257" with a status code of 200, confirming server readiness.]
4) [Step 4: A POST HTTP request is made to the same endpoint "/api/orders/26/accept" at "2025-09-27T17:08:34.803680". This is the actual attempt to accept the order.]
5) [Step 5: A POST HTTP response is received at "2025-09-27T17:08:34.819804" with a status code of 200, indicating that the order acceptance was successful and thus a conversion.]
