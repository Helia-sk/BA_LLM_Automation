==================================================

Tag: Conversion [The session involved a successful customer registration process, as indicated by the 201 status code in the HTTP response for the customer registration endpoint.]

1) [Step 1: User Interaction]
   - The user begins interacting with the registration form by entering input data such as username, first name, last name, street address, postal code, and password. There are multiple input change events logged, showing the user filling out the form fields.

2) [Step 2: Form Submission]
   - The user clicks the "Create Account" button, which triggers the form submission. This action is captured in the log with a click event on the button.

3) [Step 3: Backend Processing and Response]
   - An HTTP request is made to the `/api/customer/register` endpoint using the POST method, as logged with the "http_request" event.
   - The backend processes this request, resulting in an "http_response" event with a status code of 201, which indicates that the customer registration was successful and the resource was created.

4) [Step 4: Successful Completion]
   - The successful status code (201) confirms the conversion, as this code is typically used to indicate the successful creation of a resource in response to a POST request.
