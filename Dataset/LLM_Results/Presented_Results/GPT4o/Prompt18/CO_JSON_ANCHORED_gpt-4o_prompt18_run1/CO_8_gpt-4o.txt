==================================================

Tag: Conversion [The session resulted in a successful order placement.]

1) [Step 1: User logs in successfully]
   - The user attempts multiple logins, with a successful login on a POST request to `/api/customer/login` with status code 200 at timestamp `2025-09-13T16:30:08.106958`.

2) [Step 2: User places an order]
   - The user navigates to the order placement endpoint `/api/customer/place_order` with a POST request, resulting in a successful order placement with status code 201 at timestamp `2025-09-13T16:31:00.804070`.

3) [Step 3: User checks order history]
   - Following the order placement, the user checks their order history with a GET request to `/api/customer/dashboard/orders/` with status code 200 at timestamp `2025-09-13T16:31:01.147049`.

The session clearly follows a path of login, order placement, and checking the order history, indicating a successful conversion.
