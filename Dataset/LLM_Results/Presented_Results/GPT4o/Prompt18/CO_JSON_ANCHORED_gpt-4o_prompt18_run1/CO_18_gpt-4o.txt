==================================================

Tag: Conversion [The session shows a series of interactions leading up to a successful logout, indicating task completion rather than abandonment.]

1) The user starts by logging in:
   - `http_request` to `/api/login` with method `POST` at `2025-09-27T16:24:51.031714`.
   - Successful `http_response` from `/api/login` with status `200` at `2025-09-27T16:24:51.314326`.

2) The user interacts with the menu:
   - `http_request` to `/api/menu/` with method `GET` at `2025-09-27T16:24:56.398403`.
   - Successful `http_response` from `/api/menu/` with status `200` at `2025-09-27T16:24:56.419032`.
   - Further interactions with adding a menu item:
     - `http_request` to `/api/menu/` with method `POST` at `2025-09-27T16:25:38.875379`.
     - Successful `http_response` from `/api/menu/` with status `201` at `2025-09-27T16:25:38.903068`.

3) The user logs out:
   - `http_request` to `/api/logout` with method `POST` at `2025-09-27T16:25:43.904626`.
   - Successful `http_response` from `/api/logout` with status `200` at `2025-09-27T16:25:43.926089`.

The sequence of events indicates the user successfully completed their intended actions, logging in, interacting with the menu, and logging out, which constitutes a conversion.
