3) [Step 3: Order Placement] The critical step of conversion was the order placement at "2025-09-27T16:14:27.679867" with a "POST" request to the endpoint "/api/customer/place_order", which received a successful "http_response" with status code 201.

4) [Step 4: Order History and Confirmation] Finally, the user checked their order history, confirming the transaction through "GET" requests to "/api/customer/orders/" and "/api/customer/dashboard/orders/" with successful responses (status code 200).

These steps collectively indicate that the session was a conversion, characterized by successful login, browsing, order placement, and confirmation via order history checks.
