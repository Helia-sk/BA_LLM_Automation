==================================================

Tag: Conversion [The session involved marking an order as completed, indicated by a successful HTTP POST request with a 200 status code response.]

1) [Step 1] The session begins with requests related to retrieving orders and order details, as seen in the `GET` requests to `/api/orders/` and `/api/orders/21/details`. These requests return a 200 status code indicating successful retrieval of order information.

2) [Step 2] The session proceeds with an `OPTIONS` request to `/api/orders/21/complete`, followed by a `POST` request to the same endpoint. The `OPTIONS` request is a preflight request often used in CORS scenarios to check what HTTP methods are supported by the server.

3) [Step 3] The `POST` request to `/api/orders/21/complete` endpoint, which is meant to mark an order as completed, returns a 200 status code, indicating that the order was successfully completed.

This sequence of events demonstrates a successful transaction flow, starting with viewing orders and culminating in marking an order as completed, which is a clear indication of a conversion.
