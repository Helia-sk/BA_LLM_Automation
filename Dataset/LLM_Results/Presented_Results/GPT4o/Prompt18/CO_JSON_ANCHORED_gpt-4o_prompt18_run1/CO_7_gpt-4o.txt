==================================================

Tag: Conversion [The session includes a successful order placement, indicating a conversion event.]

1) **Login Attempt**: The session begins with a login attempt. A POST request to "/api/customer/login" is followed by a 200 status code response, indicating a successful login.
   
2) **Browsing and Interaction**: The user navigates through the dashboard, visiting various sections like "restaurant" and "cart", and interacts with elements (e.g., adding items to the cart).

3) **Order Placement**: A POST request to "/api/customer/place_order" is observed, followed by a 201 status code response, which indicates a successful order placement.

4) **Order Confirmation**: Subsequent GET requests to "/api/customer/orders/" with 200 status codes suggest the user is reviewing their orders, confirming the order placement.

The sequence of events, particularly the successful order placement, confirms this session as a conversion.
