==================================================

Tag: Conversion [The session involved a successful deletion of a menu item, which is considered a backend action completion.]

1) [The session starts with a sequence of GET requests to retrieve menu items, which were successful, indicated by status code 200. This is likely to view the current state of the menu.]
2) [An OPTIONS request for updating a menu item was made, which is often used to check the communication options available on the server.]
3) [A DELETE request was successfully executed to delete a menu item, with a status code 200 indicating successful completion of this action, thus confirming a conversion event as it represents a change in the state of the application.]
