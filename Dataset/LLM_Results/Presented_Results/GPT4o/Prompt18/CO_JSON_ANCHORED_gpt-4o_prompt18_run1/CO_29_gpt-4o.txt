==================================================

Tag: Conversion [Reason: The session includes successful API requests with responses indicating changes have been made to settings, such as updating opening hours and adding delivery areas, with status codes 200 and 201.]

1) [Step 1: Analyze the sequence of events leading to the conversion.]
   - The session involves several API requests and responses.

2) [Step 2: Identify key actions indicating conversion.]
   - A POST request to `/api/settings/opening_hours/batch_update` returns a 200 status code, indicating successful update of opening hours.
   - A POST request to `/api/settings/delivery_areas` returns a 201 status code, indicating successful addition of a delivery area.

3) [Step 3: Confirm the intentions and actions of the session.]
   - The frontend logs show clicks and form submissions related to settings changes, supporting the backend API responses that indicate settings have been updated.

Overall, the combination of the successful backend API responses and the corresponding frontend actions strongly indicate a conversion session where settings were updated successfully.
