==================================================

Tag: Drop-off [The session ended with a logout action without any conversion-related activity such as purchasing or completing a transaction.]

1) [Step 1] The session starts with the user viewing the login page and interacting with the login form inputs, indicating an attempt to log in.
2) [Step 2] The user successfully logs in, as evidenced by the POST request to the login endpoint receiving a 200 response.
3) [Step 3] After logging in, the user accesses the orders page, shown by the GET requests to the orders endpoint, both receiving 200 responses.
4) [Step 4] The user navigates to their profile page and interacts with various form inputs, including saving changes, which indicates engagement with the profile section.
5) [Step 5] Finally, the user logs out, as indicated by the POST request to the logout endpoint receiving a 200 response, marking the end of the session.

The absence of any transaction or conversion-related activities after the user logs in and views the orders page suggests that the session was a drop-off rather than a conversion.
