==================================================

Tag: Conversion [The session includes a successful login, followed by actions indicating interaction with the dashboard, and finally a logout event, indicating a complete user flow.]

1) [Step 1: Customer Login]
   - The session starts with a customer login attempt, with successful input of username and password, followed by a "Sign In" button click.
   - Corresponding backend logs confirm a successful login with a `POST` request to `/api/customer/login` and a `200` status code.

2) [Step 2: User Interaction]
   - After logging in, the user interacts with the dashboard, specifically the menu section. This includes clicking, input changes, and form submissions indicating menu item additions.
   - Backend logs show `POST` requests to `/api/menu/` with `201` status codes, confirming the addition of menu items.

3) [Step 3: Logout]
   - The session ends with a logout action, where a "Logout" button is clicked.
   - The backend logs confirm the logout with a `POST` request to `/api/logout` and a `200` status code, indicating a successful logout.

Overall, the sequence of events from login to logout, including interaction with the dashboard, suggests a completed and successful user session, which can be classified as a conversion.
