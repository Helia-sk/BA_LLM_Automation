1) **User navigates to login page** (`2025-09-13T12:19:01.704Z`)
   - User interacts with the login page, clicking and inputting text.

2) **User logs in** (`2025-09-13T14:19:08.433436`)
   - The user submits login credentials and logs in successfully.

3) **User views orders** (`2025-09-13T14:19:09.080882`)
   - The user makes a GET request to view orders, receiving a successful response.

4) **User logs out** (`2025-09-13T14:19:19.205480`)
   - The user initiates a logout process and receives a successful response, ending the session. 

The session flow indicates that the user logged in, viewed some order-related information, and then logged out. However, there is no indication of a conversion event, such as making a purchase or completing a form submission that would constitute a successful conversion.
