5) **Click**: The user clicks the "Sign In" button.
6) **Form Submit**: The login form is submitted.
7) **HTTP Request/Response**: The login endpoint is accessed (`/api/login`), and a 200 status code indicates a successful login.
8) **Click**: The user navigates to the dashboard (`http://localhost:5173/restaurant/dashboard`).
9) **Click**: The user clicks to view the menu (`http://localhost:5173/restaurant/dashboard/menu`).
10) **Click**: The user clicks "Add Item" on the menu page.
11) **Input Change**: The user inputs a text value "Hi".

15) **Input Change**: The user interacts with a textarea but does not enter any text.
16) **Click**: The user clicks a "Cancel" button, possibly indicating a decision not to proceed with a transaction.

The session primarily involves navigation and interactions with the menu, but lacks any indication of a completed transaction or conversion action (such as placing an order), leading to the classification as a drop-off.
