2) Backend POST request to `/api/orders/27/accept`, with a successful HTTP response (status code 200), confirming the order acceptance.
3) Click on "Menu" to navigate to the restaurant's menu dashboard.
4) Several interactions with the menu dashboard, including adding or attempting to add items (e.g., clicking on "Add Item").
5) Click on "Logout" button on the dashboard.
