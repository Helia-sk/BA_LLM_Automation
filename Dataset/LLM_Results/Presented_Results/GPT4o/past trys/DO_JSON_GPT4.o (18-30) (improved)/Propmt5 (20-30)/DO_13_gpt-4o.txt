1) User navigates to the homepage (`/`).
2) User clicks on a link to order food, which redirects to the login page (`/customer/login`).
3) User enters the username "User1" and a password, then submits the login form.
4) Successfully logs in, receiving a 200 HTTP response for `/api/customer/login`.
5) User clicks on "Restaurants" from the dashboard view.
6) User browses restaurant number 2, scrolling and adding items to the cart.
7) User navigates to restaurant number 7, scrolling and adding more items to the cart.
8) User clicks to view their cart.
9) User logs out by clicking the "Logout" button on the cart page.
10) Receives a successful logout response with a 200 HTTP status code from `/api/logout`. 

The user journey indicates browsing and adding items to the cart but lacks any action indicating a final purchase or order placement, leading to a classification of drop-off.
