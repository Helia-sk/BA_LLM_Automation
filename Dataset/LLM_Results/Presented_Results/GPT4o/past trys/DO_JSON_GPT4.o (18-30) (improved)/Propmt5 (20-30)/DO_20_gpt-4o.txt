3) User clicks on the password input field and enters a password.
4) User clicks "Sign In" to submit the login form.

6) User navigates to the dashboard and clicks "Menu" to view menu items.
7) User clicks "Add Item" to add an item to the menu.
8) User clicks "Cancel," indicating a potential intention to abandon the action.
