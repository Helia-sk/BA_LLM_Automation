1. **Form Submit (Login Page)**: The user clicks the username input field on the login page and enters "User1" as the username and a password, completing the form submission by clicking the "Sign In" button.
2. **Login Request**: The login form submission triggers a backend POST request to the `/api/login` endpoint, which is successfully processed with a 200 status code.
3. **Navigate to Profile**: The user navigates to the profile page by clicking on a "Profile" link from the dashboard.
4. **Profile Page Interactions**: The user interacts with the profile page by clicking and changing input fields, including updating the name field to "mybestresnew".
5. **Logout Click**: The user clicks a "Logout" button on the profile page.
6. **Logout Request**: A backend POST request to the `/api/logout` endpoint is triggered by the logout action, successfully completing with a 200 status code.
7. **Order Viewing**: The user views orders by triggering GET requests to the `/api/orders/` endpoint, both requests successfully returning 200 status codes.

All major tasks (login, interaction with profile, viewing orders, and logging out) were initiated and completed successfully, resulting in a full conversion.
