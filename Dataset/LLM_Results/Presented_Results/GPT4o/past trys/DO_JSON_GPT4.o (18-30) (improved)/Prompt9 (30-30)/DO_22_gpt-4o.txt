==================================================

Tag: Mixed Session || [Reason: The session included both completed tasks (successful login and viewing orders) and incomplete tasks (adding a menu item with no confirmation of completion)].

1. User navigates to the homepage (page_view event at timestamp 2025-09-13T12:28:17.602Z).
2. User clicks "Restaurant Login" (click event at timestamp 2025-09-13T12:28:33.269Z).

6. User submits login form (form_submit event at timestamp 2025-09-13T12:28:37.814Z).
7. Successful login is confirmed (http_response event at timestamp 2025-09-13T14:28:38.736100).
8. User accesses orders (http_request and http_response events between 2025-09-13T14:28:39.110465 and 2025-09-13T14:28:39.381856).
9. User navigates to the menu page (click event at timestamp 2025-09-13T12:28:41.033Z).
10. User interacts with input fields (click and input_change events at timestamps 2025-09-13T12:28:49.790Z to 2025-09-13T12:28:54.633Z).
11. User attempts to add an item to the menu (click event at timestamp 2025-09-13T12:28:54.733Z).
12. User cancels the action (click event at timestamp 2025-09-13T12:28:58.769Z).
13. User retrieves menu items (http_request and http_response events between 2025-09-13T14:28:41.363050 and 2025-09-13T14:28:41.640283).

In this session, the initial tasks such as logging in and checking orders were completed successfully, but the task of adding an item to the menu was not confirmed as completed. Hence, the session is classified as mixed.
