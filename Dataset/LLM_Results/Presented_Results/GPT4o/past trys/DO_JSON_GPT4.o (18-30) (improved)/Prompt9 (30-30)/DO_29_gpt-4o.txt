1. The user starts by clicking on "Orders" at the restaurant dashboard.
2. The system processes a request to get orders (`/api/orders/`) and successfully returns a response with status code 200.
3. The user then clicks on "Menu" to navigate to the menu section.
4. The system processes a request to get menu items (`/api/menu/`) twice, successfully returning a response with status code 200 both times.
5. The user interacts with the menu by clicking, inputting, and making changes.
6. The user submits a form to update a menu item, triggering the `menu.update_menu_item` endpoint.
7. The system processes the update menu item request (`/api/menu/18`) and successfully returns a response with status code 200.
8. The user clicks the "Logout" button.
9. The system processes the logout request (`/api/logout`) and successfully returns a response with status code 200. 

All tasks (viewing orders, updating menu items, and logging out) were completed without any indication of abandonment, leading to a classification of the session as a conversion.
