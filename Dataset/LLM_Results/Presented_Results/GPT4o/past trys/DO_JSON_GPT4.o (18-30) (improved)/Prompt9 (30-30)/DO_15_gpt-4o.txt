Tag: Drop-Off || The session involved an attempt to log in, but the user did not complete the login process as the password was not provided.

1. The user clicked on the "Restaurant Partners" link, which likely navigated them to the restaurant login page.
2. The user clicked into the username input field and typed a single character ("d").
3. The user blurred out of the username field, leaving the input value unchanged.
4. The user clicked the "Sign In" button, attempting to submit the login form.
5. The password field was left empty, as indicated by the input change event for the password field showing a final value length of 0. 
6. Finally, the user clicked on a "Lieferspatz" element, but this was not linked to completing any task. 

The session was a drop-off because the login was not completed due to missing password input.
