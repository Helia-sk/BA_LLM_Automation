Prompt: You are analyzing web session logs.
Decide if the user finished the task they started ("Conversion") 
or abandoned/failed it without retry ("Drop-Off").
Definitions:
- Conversion = The user completes the initiated task (e.g., login, sign-up, purchase, edit, add-to-cart).
- Drop-Off = The user does not complete the task (abandons session, leaves mid-process, or fails without retry).
Only choose one of these two categories.
Output must begin with Tag: followed by either Conversion or Drop-Off.
Now analyze the following session:
==================================================

Tag: Drop-Off

The session log shows a sequence of events that include a successful login and an unsuccessful order attempt. The user was able to log in successfully, as indicated by the 200 status code in the "customer_login.login" endpoint. However, the attempt to place an order failed with a 400 status code in the "customer_place_order.place_order" endpoint, indicating a client-side error in the request. There are no further attempts to correct the order failure or retry, indicating a drop-off in completing the intended task of placing an order.
