Prompt: You are analyzing web session logs.
Decide if the user finished the task they started ("Conversion") 
or abandoned/failed it without retry ("Drop-Off").
Definitions:
- Conversion = The user completes the initiated task (e.g., login, sign-up, purchase, edit, add-to-cart).
- Drop-Off = The user does not complete the task (abandons session, leaves mid-process, or fails without retry).
Only choose one of these two categories.
Output must begin with Tag: followed by either Conversion or Drop-Off.
Now analyze the following session:
==================================================

Tag: Drop-Off

The session logs indicate that the user attempted to log in by interacting with the username and password fields, but there is no indication of a successful submission or completion of the login process. The logs show input changes and clicks, but no final event indicating a completed login, such as a successful redirect or status code. Therefore, the task appears to have been abandoned or failed without retry.
