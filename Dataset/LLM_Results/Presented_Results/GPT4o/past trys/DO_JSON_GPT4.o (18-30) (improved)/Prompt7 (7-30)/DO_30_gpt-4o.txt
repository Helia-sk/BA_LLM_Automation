Prompt: You are analyzing web session logs.
Decide if the user finished the task they started ("Conversion") 
or abandoned/failed it without retry ("Drop-Off").
Definitions:
- Conversion = The user completes the initiated task (e.g., login, sign-up, purchase, edit, add-to-cart).
- Drop-Off = The user does not complete the task (abandons session, leaves mid-process, or fails without retry).
Only choose one of these two categories.
Output must begin with Tag: followed by either Conversion or Drop-Off.
Now analyze the following session:
==================================================

Tag: Conversion

The session logs indicate that the user completed multiple tasks successfully. The key actions include:

1. **Logout**: The user initiated a logout request and received a successful HTTP 200 response, indicating the logout was successful.

2. **Order Acceptance**: The user accepted an order, which was confirmed with a successful HTTP 200 response.

These actions show that the user completed their intended tasks, leading to a conclusion of "Conversion."
