Prompt: You are analyzing web session logs.
Decide if the user finished the task they started ("Conversion") 
or abandoned/failed it without retry ("Drop-Off").
Definitions:
- Conversion = The user completes the initiated task (e.g., login, sign-up, purchase, edit, add-to-cart).
- Drop-Off = The user does not complete the task (abandons session, leaves mid-process, or fails without retry).
Only choose one of these two categories.
Output must begin with Tag: followed by either Conversion or Drop-Off.
Now analyze the following session:
==================================================

Tag: Conversion

The session logs show a sequence of events indicating a successful login and subsequent logout. The sequence includes form submission for login, a successful HTTP response indicating login completion, navigation activities, and a successful logout request. This indicates that the user completed the login task they initiated, followed by browsing and logging out, which constitutes a "Conversion."
