Prompt: You are analyzing web session logs.
Decide if the user finished the task they started ("Conversion") 
or abandoned/failed it without retry ("Drop-Off").
Definitions:
- Conversion = The user completes the initiated task (e.g., login, sign-up, purchase, edit, add-to-cart).
- Drop-Off = The user does not complete the task (abandons session, leaves mid-process, or fails without retry).
Only choose one of these two categories.
Output must begin with Tag: followed by either Conversion or Drop-Off.
Now analyze the following session:
==================================================

Tag: Conversion

The session indicates that several tasks were completed successfully:
1. The user viewed orders, menu items, and updated a menu item with successful HTTP 200 responses.
2. The user also logged out successfully with a 200 status code response for the logout action.

These actions suggest that the user completed their intended tasks, leading to a conversion.
