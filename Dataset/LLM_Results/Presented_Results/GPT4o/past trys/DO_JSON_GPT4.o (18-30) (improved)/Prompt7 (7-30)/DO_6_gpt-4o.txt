Prompt: You are analyzing web session logs.
Decide if the user finished the task they started ("Conversion") 
or abandoned/failed it without retry ("Drop-Off").
Definitions:
- Conversion = The user completes the initiated task (e.g., login, sign-up, purchase, edit, add-to-cart).
- Drop-Off = The user does not complete the task (abandons session, leaves mid-process, or fails without retry).
Only choose one of these two categories.
Output must begin with Tag: followed by either Conversion or Drop-Off.
Now analyze the following session:
==================================================

Tag: Drop-Off

The session shows that the user interacted with the login page by entering some input in the fields and clicking a button, but there is no indication of a successful completion of a task such as a login or sign-up. The session lacks any evidence of a response from the server or a status code indicating success. Therefore, it is categorized as a "Drop-Off."
