Tag: Conversion [The session includes an API call to accept an order, suggesting the user successfully completed an action indicative of a conversion.]

1) **User Dashboard Interaction**: The session begins with a click event on the restaurant dashboard, specifically on an element identified as an SVG. This suggests the user was navigating or interacting with the dashboard, possibly to view details or options related to orders.

2) **Order Acceptance Click**: The user clicks a button labeled "Accept" on the restaurant dashboard. This indicates intent to accept an order, a common conversion action in systems where orders can be managed or fulfilled.

3) **Backend Order Acceptance Request**: A backend HTTP request is logged for the route `/api/orders/26/accept`. This confirms the frontend action (button click) initiated a backend process to accept an order.

4) **Backend Order Acceptance Response**: A backend HTTP response is logged for the same route, `/api/orders/26/accept`. The presence of a response indicates the server processed the acceptance request, likely confirming the order acceptance was successful.

Overall, the sequence of frontend and backend events points to the successful completion of an order acceptance, hence a conversion.
