==================================================

Tag: Drop-Off [Reason: The user journey only includes interactions with the menu, and there is no evidence of a transaction or significant engagement beyond viewing the menu.]

1) The user began their session with a click event on the "Menu" link, as indicated by the frontend click event at `2025-09-27T15:03:48.126Z`. This click navigated them to the `/restaurant/dashboard/menu` page.
   
2) The user performed a scroll action on the menu page, as indicated by the frontend scroll event at `2025-09-27T15:03:51.599Z`. This suggests the user was browsing or reviewing the menu content.

3) The user then clicked on an element within the menu page at `2025-09-27T15:03:55.886Z`. The details do not specify a significant action like adding an item to a cart or proceeding to checkout.

4) Backend logs show multiple API requests and responses related to `/api/menu/` and `/api/menu/22` around `2025-09-27T17:03:48` to `2025-09-27T17:03:56`. These logs indicate backend activity to retrieve menu information but do not show any further transactions or actions that could lead to a conversion.

Overall, the log data suggests the session was focused on browsing the menu without any further engagement indicative of a conversion, such as placing an order or signing up.
