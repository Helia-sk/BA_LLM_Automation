==================================================

Tag: Conversion [The session includes a successful login followed by actions indicative of continued engagement and interaction with the application.]

1) [The user initiates a session by navigating to the login page (`/customer/login`) and interacts with the login form by filling in the username and password fields.]
2) [A form submission occurs, indicating a login attempt, which is successful as the subsequent logs show actions within the application dashboard.]
3) [The user navigates through different parts of the application, such as visiting different restaurants (`/customer/dashboard/restaurant/2` and `/customer/dashboard/restaurant/6`) and interacting with the cart (`/customer/dashboard/cart`).]
4) [The session includes multiple interactions with the interface, such as clicks and scroll events, and ends with a logout action (`/api/logout`). This sequence of events suggests a conversion as the user successfully logged in and engaged with the application.]
