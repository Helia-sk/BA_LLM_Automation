==================================================

**Tag**: Drop-Off [Reason: The session does not contain any event indicating a successful login or any further navigation beyond the login page, suggesting the user did not proceed with the conversion.]

1) **Click on 'Customer Login'**: At `2025-09-13T11:41:35.638Z`, the user clicks on the "Customer Login" link, directing them to the login page (`/customer/login`).
   
2) **Click on 'Username' Input Field**: At `2025-09-13T11:41:37.593Z`, the user clicks on the username input field to enter their username.

3) **Input Username**: At `2025-09-13T11:41:39.210Z`, the user begins typing their username, "dkjhf", into the input field, with the event triggered by debounced input. The same input action is confirmed at `2025-09-13T11:41:39.767Z` when the user moves focus away from the username field (trigger: blur).

4) **Click on 'Password' Input Field**: At `2025-09-13T11:41:39.845Z`, the user clicks on the password input field to enter their password.

5) **Input Password**: At `2025-09-13T11:41:40.920Z`, the user begins typing their password, which is hidden, and the input action is triggered by debounced input. This action is confirmed again at `2025-09-13T11:41:47.425Z` when the user moves focus away from the password field (trigger: blur).

The session does not include a submission of the login form or any indication of successful login, so the session is classified as a drop-off.
