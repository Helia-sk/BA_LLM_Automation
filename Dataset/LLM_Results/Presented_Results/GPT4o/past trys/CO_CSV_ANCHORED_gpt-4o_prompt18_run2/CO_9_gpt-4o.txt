==================================================

Tag: Conversion [The session includes a sequence of actions that demonstrates the user successfully placing an order.]

1) [Step 1] The session begins with the user navigating through the customer dashboard and exploring different sections, such as restaurants and orders (e.g., logs with URLs like `/customer/dashboard`, `/customer/dashboard/restaurant/4`, `/customer/dashboard/restaurant/5`).

2) [Step 2] The user adds an item to the cart (e.g., log with URL `/customer/dashboard/restaurant/8` and text "Added").

3) [Step 3] The user views the cart (e.g., logs with URL `/customer/dashboard/cart`), indicating an intent to purchase.

4) [Step 4] Backend logs show requests and responses for placing an order (`/api/customer/place_order`), indicating that the user completed the purchase process.

Overall, the session's flow from browsing to placing an order indicates a conversion event.
