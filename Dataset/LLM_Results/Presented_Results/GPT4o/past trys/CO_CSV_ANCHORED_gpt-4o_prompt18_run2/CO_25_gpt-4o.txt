==================================================

Tag: Drop-off [The session primarily consists of interactions with the menu API without a clear conversion action such as a purchase or form submission. The user navigated the menu but did not proceed to a conversion endpoint.]

1) [Step 1] The session starts with backend requests and responses related to the menu API, indicating the user is browsing the menu: 
   - Requests and responses to `/api/menu/22` and `/api/menu/`.
   
2) [Step 2] The frontend logs show user interactions like clicking and scrolling on the menu page:
   - Click events at `/restaurant/dashboard/menu` with no significant conversion action such as a form submission.
   
3) [Step 3] No subsequent actions indicating a conversion are logged. The session lacks any transaction or checkout events, marking it as a drop-off.
