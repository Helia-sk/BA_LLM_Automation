==================================================

Tag: Conversion [Reason: The session contains successful form submissions indicating user engagement and completion of intended actions.]

1) [Step 1: The session includes multiple `click` events on buttons labeled "Submit Changes" and "Add," indicating user interaction with the form.]
2) [Step 2: The session also contains `form_submit` events, which indicate that the user submitted forms successfully.]
3) [Step 3: The details of the `form_submit` events show that client validation passed, suggesting that the submissions were valid and processed as intended.]
4) [Step 4: The sequence of events suggests a logical flow from form interaction to submission, characteristic of a conversion process.]
