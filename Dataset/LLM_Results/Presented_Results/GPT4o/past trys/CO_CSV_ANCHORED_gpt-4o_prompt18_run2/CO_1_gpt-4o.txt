==================================================

Tag: Drop-off [User interaction with the login form was initiated but failed to complete the login process successfully.]

1) [Step 1] The user navigated to the login page and clicked on "Customer Login" as indicated by the frontend click event at `2025-09-13T14:07:52.157Z`.
2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the username input field and entered data (`User1`) in two steps, as documented by the input_change events at `2025-09-13T14:07:55.335Z` and `2025-09-13T14:07:56.229Z`.
3) [Step 3] The user clicked on the password input field and attempted to enter a password, as shown by the input_change events at `2025-09-13T14:07:56.342Z` and `2025-09-13T14:07:57.966Z`.
4) [Step 4] Further input for the password was made, indicated by the input_change event at `2025-09-13T14:08:21.777Z`.
5) [Step 5] The user submitted the form, as captured by the form_submit event at `2025-09-13T14:08:21.913Z`.
6) [Step 6] A backend request for login was made at `2025-09-13T16:08:22.233323`, followed by a corresponding response at `2025-09-13T16:08:22.472442`.

Reason: The session did not achieve a conversion due to the absence of any successful login confirmation or further navigation beyond the login attempt. The backend response suggests that the login request might not have been successful, potentially due to incorrect credentials or other issues.
