==================================================

Tag: Conversion [The session indicates a successful order placement.]

1) The session begins with interactions on the customer dashboard, including clicks and scrolls, which suggest the user is navigating the platform.
2) The user then clicks on the "Restaurants" link, indicating interest in viewing restaurant options.
3) Subsequent clicks on the restaurant page and the "Added" button suggest the user is adding items to their cart.
4) The user navigates to the cart page, where they interact with input fields, likely adjusting order details or providing additional information.
5) A click event labeled "Processing..." on the cart page suggests the user is completing the order process.
6) Backend logs confirm the user placed an order through the `/api/customer/place_order` endpoint, followed by requests to the `/api/customer/orders/` endpoint, likely to fetch the order details or confirmation.

This sequence of actions strongly indicates a conversion, as the user successfully placed an order.
