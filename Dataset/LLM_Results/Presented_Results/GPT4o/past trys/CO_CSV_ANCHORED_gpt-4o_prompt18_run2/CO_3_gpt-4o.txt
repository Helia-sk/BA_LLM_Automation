Tag: Conversion [The session details indicate a successful login attempt followed by API interactions typical of a user successfully completing an order.]

1) The user clicks on "Restaurant Login" link and navigates to the login page.
2) The user inputs a username and password on the login form and submits it.
3) The backend logs show successful HTTP requests and responses for the "/api/login" endpoint, indicating a successful login.
4) Following the login, there are multiple HTTP requests and responses to the "/api/orders/" endpoint, suggesting the user is interacting with the ordering system after logging in, which implies a conversion.
