==================================================

Tag: Drop-off [The session did not result in a conversion, as the user did not complete the intended action of creating an account or placing an order. The user only interacted with the login form and navigated to different sections without a successful submission.]

1) The user navigated to the '/restaurant/login' page and interacted with the login form by entering values in the username, name, description, street, postal code, and password fields. Several input changes were detected.
2) The user clicked the 'Create Account' button on the '/restaurant/login' page but did not proceed with a full form submission that would indicate a successful account creation or login.
3) There were no backend events or API calls related to a successful registration or order placement in this session, indicating the user's journey ended without a conversion.
