Tag: Conversion [The session includes requests and responses related to completing an order, indicating a successful transaction process.]

1) The session includes multiple backend logs related to `/api/orders/21/complete`, which suggests an order completion process.
2) There are HTTP request and response pairs indicating communication between the client and server to complete the order.
3) No evidence of failed transactions or navigation away from the order completion process is present.
4) The session appears to culminate in a successful order completion, hence a conversion.
