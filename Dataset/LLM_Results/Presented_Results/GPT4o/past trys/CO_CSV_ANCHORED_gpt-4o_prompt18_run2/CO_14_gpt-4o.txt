==================================================

Tag: Conversion [The session ended with a successful order placement.]

1) The session begins with a user logging in (`/customer/login`).
2) The user navigates to the customer dashboard (`/customer/dashboard`).
3) The user visits a specific restaurant page (`/customer/dashboard/restaurant/9`) and interacts with it, as indicated by multiple "click" events with the text "Added," suggesting items are being added to a cart.
4) The user navigates to their cart (`/customer/dashboard/cart`) and interacts with it.
5) The backend logs indicate a request to place an order (`/api/customer/place_order`) followed by a successful response, confirming that the order was placed.
6) Additional interactions with the orders page (`/api/customer/orders/`) suggest the user was viewing their order history or confirmation. 

The sequence of events indicates a successful conversion, as the user completes the transaction by placing an order.
