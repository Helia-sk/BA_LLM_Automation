Tag: Conversion [The session includes a sequence of actions that indicate an order acceptance, which is typically considered a conversion event.]

1) [Step 1: The session starts with a frontend click event on the "/restaurant/dashboard" page. This interaction involves a button click, which likely initiates a backend process to accept an order.]
   - Log ID: log_1758985714781_tw6p4axzk
   - Event Name: click
   - Route: /restaurant/dashboard
   - Details: Button click with text "Accept".

2) [Step 2: A backend request is made to the "/api/orders/26/accept" endpoint. This shows that the frontend click initiated a request to accept an order.]
   - Log ID: 830728ad-7f89-4eb1-8ea7-ca32ca8aab7a
   - Event Name: http_request
   - Route: /api/orders/26/accept

3) [Step 3: A backend response is received for the "/api/orders/26/accept" endpoint. This implies that the request was processed successfully, completing the order acceptance process.]
