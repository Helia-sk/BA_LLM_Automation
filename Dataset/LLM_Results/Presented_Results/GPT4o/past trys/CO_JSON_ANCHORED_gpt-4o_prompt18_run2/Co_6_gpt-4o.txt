==================================================

Tag: Conversion [The session resulted in a successful order placement, indicating a conversion.]

1) **Login Attempt**: The session begins with a login attempt where a user inputs their credentials and successfully logs in, as indicated by the `POST` request to `/api/customer/login` with a `200` status code. This sets the stage for further actions by an authenticated user.
   
2) **Browsing and Adding to Cart**: The user navigates through the dashboard, views a restaurant, and adds items to the cart. This is reflected in the series of `click` and `scroll` events on the restaurant and cart pages. Actions such as clicking "Added" on the restaurant page suggest items are being added to the cart.

3) **Placing an Order**: The user proceeds to place an order, as evident from the `POST` request to `/api/customer/place_order` with a `201` status code. This indicates that the order was successfully created, marking a key conversion event in the session.

4) **Order Confirmation and History Check**: Following the order placement, the session includes `GET` requests to fetch `order_history` and `customer_orders`, both returning `200` status codes. This suggests the user is confirming the order and reviewing their order history, solidifying the conversion status of the session.
