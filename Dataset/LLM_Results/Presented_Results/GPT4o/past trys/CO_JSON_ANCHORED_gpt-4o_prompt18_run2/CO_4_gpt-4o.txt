==================================================

Tag: Conversion [The log file indicates that a user registration occurred, which typically signifies a conversion.]

1) [Step 1: User Interaction] The session begins with a user navigating and interacting with the login page, entering information such as username and password. This is evidenced by multiple input change events and clicks on input fields and buttons.
2) [Step 2: Account Creation] The user then clicks on "Create Account" on the login page, which triggers a form submission event with all the required fields filled.
3) [Step 3: Registration Request] This submission leads to a POST request to the "/api/register" endpoint, as seen in the backend log entries with the method "POST".
4) [Step 4: Successful Registration] The server responds to the registration request with a status code 201, indicating successful account creation, which is a significant conversion event.
5) [Step 5: Further Activity] After registration, the user proceeds to interact with the orders API as shown by the GET requests to "/api/orders/" with successful 200 status codes. This suggests continued engagement post-conversion.
