2) [Step 2: Browse and Add to Cart] - The user navigates through a restaurant page and interacts with the cart, as seen in the frontend logs (`/customer/dashboard/restaurant/9` and `/customer/dashboard/cart`).
3) [Step 3: Place Order] - The session includes a successful order placement at the endpoint `/api/customer/place_order` with a 201 status code, indicating a conversion.
