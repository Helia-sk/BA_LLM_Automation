==================================================

Tag: Conversion [The session includes a successful order completion, indicated by a POST request to mark an order completed followed by a 200 status code response].

1) **Step 1**: A series of GET requests retrieve the order list and order details, which are common precursors to making a decision about an order.
   - GET `/api/orders/` with a 200 response.
   - GET `/api/orders/21/details` with a 200 response.

2) **Step 2**: The session includes an OPTIONS request to the endpoint `/api/orders/21/complete`, which typically precedes an actual POST request to the same endpoint.
   - OPTIONS `/api/orders/21/complete` followed by a 200 response.

3) **Step 3**: A POST request to the endpoint `/api/orders/21/complete` is made, which is confirmed by a subsequent 200 response indicating that the order completion was successful.
   - POST `/api/orders/21/complete` with a 200 response, indicating a successful order completion.

This sequence of actions confirms that the session resulted in a successful conversion.
