==================================================

Tag: Conversion [The session resulted in a successful update to a menu item, as indicated by the HTTP 200 status code in the backend logs.]

1) **Frontend Interaction**: Multiple user interactions are logged on the frontend, including clicks and form submissions on the menu dashboard. These interactions suggest the user was actively engaging with the menu.

2) **Form Submission**: The frontend logs show a form submission event, which indicates the user attempted to save changes to a menu item. This is supported by the click event on the "Save Changes" button.

3) **Backend Processing**: The backend logs show a sequence of HTTP requests and responses related to the menu endpoint. Specifically, a PUT request to update a menu item is logged, followed by a 200 status code response, confirming the update was successful.

4) **Successful Update Confirmation**: The backend response with a status code of 200 indicates that the update operation was completed successfully, which constitutes a conversion in this context.
