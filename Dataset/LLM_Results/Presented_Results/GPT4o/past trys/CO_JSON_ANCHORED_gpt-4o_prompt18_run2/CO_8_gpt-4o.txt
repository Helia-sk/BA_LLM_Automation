Tag: Conversion [The session shows a successful customer order placement, indicating a conversion.]

1) **Login Attempt**: The session starts with multiple login attempts, which includes both failed and successful attempts. The successful login is indicated by a `POST /api/customer/login` request with a `200` status code timestamped at `2025-09-13T16:30:08.106958`.

2) **Browsing Activity**: After logging in, the user navigates through the dashboard, checking orders and cart details. This is evident from the `GET /api/customer/orders/` and `GET /api/customer/dashboard/orders/` requests.

3) **Order Placement**: The session includes a critical action where the user places an order. This is confirmed by the `POST /api/customer/place_order` request, which results in a `201` status code at `2025-09-13T16:31:00.804070`, indicating successful order placement.

Therefore, the presence of a successful order placement marks this session as a conversion.
