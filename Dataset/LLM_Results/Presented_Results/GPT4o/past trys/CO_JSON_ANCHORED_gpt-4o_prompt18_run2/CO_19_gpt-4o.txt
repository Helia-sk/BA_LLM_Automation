Tag: Conversion [The session shows a successful sequence of interactions leading to a logout, indicating the user completed their intended actions.]

1) [Step 1] The session begins with the user viewing the restaurant dashboard and engaging in various actions, such as adding items to the menu. This is evidenced by multiple "click" and "form_submit" events related to adding menu items.
   
2) [Step 2] The user continues to interact extensively with the menu and inputs specific details, such as item names and categories, as indicated by "input_change" events. This suggests active engagement and successful navigation through the interface.

3) [Step 3] The session logs include a successful "POST" request to the `/api/menu/` endpoint, with a response status code of 201, indicating that items were successfully added to the menu. This is a key indicator of conversion, as it suggests the user achieved a primary goal of the application.

4) [Step 4] The session concludes with a "click" event on the "Logout" button, followed by a "POST" request to the `/api/logout` endpoint, which receives a response with a status code of 200. This confirms that the user completed their session by logging out, further supporting the conclusion of a successful conversion.
