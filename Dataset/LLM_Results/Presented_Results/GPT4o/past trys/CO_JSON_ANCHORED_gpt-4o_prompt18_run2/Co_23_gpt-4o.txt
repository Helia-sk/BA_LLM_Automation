==================================================

Tag: Conversion [The session resulted in successful updates and additions, which indicates user actions were completed as intended.]

1) **User Interaction**: The session started with a user clicking through the frontend settings interface, with several clicks and input changes logged, such as selecting settings options and entering data.
2) **Form Submission**: The user submitted changes via the frontend, as seen in the form submit logs.
3) **Backend Processing**: The backend logs show successful HTTP requests and responses for updating opening hours and adding delivery areas. Specifically, the following actions were successful:
   - A POST request to the `/api/settings/opening_hours/batch_update` endpoint resulted in a `200` status, indicating a successful update of opening hours.
   - A POST request to the `/api/settings/delivery_areas` endpoint resulted in a `201` status, indicating a successful addition of a delivery area.
4) **Response Confirmation**: The status codes `200` for updates and `201` for additions confirm that the changes made by the user were processed successfully, indicating a conversion rather than a drop-off.
