==================================================

Tag: Conversion [The session includes a complete sequence of actions leading up to a successful order placement, followed by a logout, indicating a successful transaction or conversion.]

1) **Login Attempt:**
   - A series of logs show a user attempting to log in via the `/api/customer/login` endpoint. 
   - The sequence of events includes input changes for the username and password fields, followed by a form submission.
   - The backend logs confirm a successful login with a `POST` request resulting in a `200` status code response.

2) **Order Placement:**
   - After logging in, the user navigates through the dashboard and selects items to add to the cart.
   - The user proceeds to place an order using the `/api/customer/place_order` endpoint.
   - The logs capture a `POST` request for order placement, which results in a successful `201` status code, confirming that the order was placed successfully.

3) **Order History Verification:**
   - The user checks their order history via the `/api/customer/dashboard/orders/` endpoint.
   - The backend logs confirm successful retrieval of order history with `GET` requests returning a `200` status code.

4) **Logout:**
   - Finally, the user logs out of the session using the `/api/logout` endpoint.
   - The logs show a `POST` request to the logout endpoint, confirmed by a `200` status code, indicating a successful logout.

This sequence of actions—from login, order placement, checking order history, to logout—demonstrates a successful conversion in the session.
