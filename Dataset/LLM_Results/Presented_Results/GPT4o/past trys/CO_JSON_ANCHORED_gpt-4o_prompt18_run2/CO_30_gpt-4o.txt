==================================================

Tag: Conversion [The session successfully executed an order rejection, which is a completed action indicative of a conversion.]

1) [Step 1: The session begins with a page view on the restaurant dashboard, indicating the user's entry point into the application.]

2) [Step 2: The user navigates through the dashboard and history sections, as evidenced by multiple click events on various buttons, such as "History," "View Details," and closing actions.]

3) [Step 3: The user performs a significant action by clicking the "Reject" button, triggering a backend process to reject an order, as seen in the logs with the "orders.reject_order" endpoint.]

4) [Step 4: The backend processes the order rejection request, with corresponding HTTP request and response logs showing a status code of 200, confirming successful execution of the order rejection.]

5) [Step 5: The log sequence indicates that the intended action (order rejection) was completed without any errors, marking this session as a conversion rather than a drop-off.]
