==================================================

Tag: Conversion [Reason: The session included a series of actions that suggest a completed process, starting from login and leading to a successful logout.]

1) **Login Attempt**: The session started with a user logging in successfully. This is indicated by the series of logs related to the login process, including the submission of login credentials and a successful 200 HTTP response for the login POST request.
   
2) **Order Viewing**: After logging in, the user navigated to view customer orders. This is evidenced by GET requests to the `/api/customer/orders/` endpoint, which returned successful 200 HTTP responses, suggesting the user was able to view their orders.

3) **Navigation and Interaction**: The user interacted with the application by clicking through various parts of the customer dashboard, such as viewing restaurants and adding items to the cart. This is shown by a series of frontend click events on buttons labeled "Added" and navigation events.

4) **Logout**: The session concluded with a logout action. This is confirmed by the HTTP POST request to the `/api/logout` endpoint, which was successful with a 200 HTTP response status, indicating the user ended their session properly.

Overall, this sequence of events from login to logout, including interactions and order viewing, suggests a complete session cycle, which is indicative of a conversion rather than a drop-off.
