==================================================

Tag: Conversion [The session includes a successful login followed by accessing various settings and performing actions before logging out, indicating user engagement and task completion.]

1) [Step 1: Login] 
   - A login request is made at "2025-09-13T14:30:23.306406" with a POST request to "/api/login".
   - A successful login response is received at "2025-09-13T14:30:23.640507" with a status code of 200.

2) [Step 2: Interaction with the Application] 
   - After logging in, the user accesses several endpoints related to orders and settings, such as "/api/orders/", "/api/settings/delivery_areas", and "/api/settings/opening_hours".
   - These interactions indicate that the user is actively engaging with the application, possibly managing settings or viewing orders.

3) [Step 3: Logout]
   - The session ends with a logout request at "2025-09-13T14:30:43.814272" and a successful logout response at "2025-09-13T14:30:43.829027" with a status code of 200.

Overall, the sequence of events shows a complete user session from login to logout, with meaningful interaction in between, indicating a conversion rather than a drop-off.
