==================================================

Tag: Conversion [Reason: The session includes a successful login followed by user activity such as browsing restaurants and adding items, concluding with a logout, indicating a complete user journey.]

1) [Step 1: The session starts with a login attempt.]
   - The user navigates to the login page and submits login credentials.
   - `Event Name: form_submit` with route `/customer/login` indicates a login form submission.
   - Matched with a backend response `Event Name: http_response` with status code `200` for `/api/customer/login` confirming a successful login.

2) [Step 2: User engages with the application after login.]
   - The user browses through different sections of the dashboard.
   - Events such as `click` and `scroll` indicate active engagement with the dashboard and specific restaurants.
   - `GET` requests to `/api/customer/orders/` show the user checking their orders.

3) [Step 3: The session ends with a logout.]
   - The user clicks on the "Logout" button, as indicated by the `click` event with the text "Logout".
   - This triggers a `POST` request to `/api/logout` with a successful `http_response` status code `200`, confirming the session ended with a logout. 

Overall, the sequence of login, browsing, and logout suggests the session was a conversion, as the user completed a typical journey through the application.
