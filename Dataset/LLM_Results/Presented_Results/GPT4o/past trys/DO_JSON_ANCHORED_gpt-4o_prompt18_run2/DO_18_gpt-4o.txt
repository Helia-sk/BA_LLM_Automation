==================================================

Tag: Drop-off [Reason: The session shows a series of interactions leading to a successful login and subsequent logout, but there is no indication of a conversion event such as a purchase or another specific goal completion.]

1) [Step 1: User initiates login process by interacting with the login page and submitting credentials.]
   - Events: `input_change` for username and password, followed by `form_submit`.

2) [Step 2: Successful login response is received.]
   - Event: `http_response` with status code 200 for the `/api/login` endpoint.

3) [Step 3: User navigates through the dashboard and profile sections.]
   - Events: Multiple `click` and `scroll` events on the dashboard and profile routes.

4) [Step 4: User logs out.]
   - Event: `http_request` and `http_response` for the `/api/logout` endpoint with status code 200.

5) [Conclusion: The session ends without any further interactions indicating a conversion. The session trajectory suggests exploration and logout without engaging in any conversion activities.]
