==================================================

Tag: Conversion [The session shows a successful login and subsequent actions indicating user engagement with the platform.]

1) [Step 1] User navigates to the login page and begins interacting: Several interactions, such as clicks and input changes, are logged on the login form.
2) [Step 2] User submits the login form: A form submission event indicates the user has entered data to log in.
3) [Step 3] Successful login: An HTTP POST request to the `/api/login` endpoint returns a 200 status code, indicating a successful login.
4) [Step 4] User checks orders: The user makes GET requests to the `/api/orders/` endpoint, with successful responses indicating they are viewing their orders.
5) [Step 5] User logs out: The user clicks a logout button, and a POST request to the `/api/logout` endpoint returns a 200 status code, indicating a successful logout.

These steps collectively indicate that the user successfully logged in, interacted with the service (viewed orders), and logged out, characterizing the session as a conversion.
