==================================================

Tag: Drop-off [Reason: The session ends with a logout action without any conversion-related activity following it.]

1) [Step 1: The session begins with navigation through the dashboard and accessing the menu and orders.]
   - Multiple `GET` requests to `/api/orders/` and `/api/menu/` with successful `200` status code responses indicate the user is browsing orders and menu items.

2) [Step 2: The user attempts to update a menu item.]
   - A `PUT` request to `/api/menu/18` with a `200` status code response indicates the menu update was successful.

3) [Step 3: The session ends with a logout action.]
   - A `POST` request to `/api/logout` with a `200` status code response indicates the user logged out successfully.
   - The preceding frontend event is a click on the "Logout" button, confirming the user's intention to end the session. 

There are no events indicating a conversion, such as a completed purchase or form submission leading to a conversion, before the logout. Therefore, this session is classified as a drop-off.
