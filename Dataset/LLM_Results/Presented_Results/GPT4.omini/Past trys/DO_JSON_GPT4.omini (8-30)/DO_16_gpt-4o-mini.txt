Tag: Conversion [The session culminated in a successful login, indicating a conversion rather than a drop-off.]

1) User navigates to the login page (`/restaurant/login`).
2) User interacts with the username input field, entering "User1" (event logged as `input_change`).
3) User interacts with the password input field, entering a password (event logged as `input_change`).
4) User clicks the "Sign In" button to submit the login form, triggering a `click` event.
5) The login request is processed, and a successful response (status code 200) is received, confirming the conversion.
6) The user is redirected or remains logged in, as indicated by the successful login response.
7) User subsequently accesses the orders page (`/api/orders/`) to view their orders (status code 200 confirms successful retrieval of orders).
8) The user logs out by clicking the "Logout" button, triggering a logout request (`/api/logout`), which is also successfully processed (status code 200). 

The sequence of actions demonstrates that the user completed the login process and viewed orders, ultimately indicating a conversion as they engaged with the application successfully.
