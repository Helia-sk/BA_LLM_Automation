==================================================

Tag: Drop-Off [The session ends with a 400 status code on the order placement, indicating a failure to complete the conversion process.]

1) User navigates to the login page and submits login credentials (username: "User1", password).
2) The login attempt is successful, as indicated by the 200 status code response.
3) User then interacts with the dashboard, specifically the cart, by adding an item (indicated by clicks and input changes).
4) After interacting with the cart, user attempts to place an order (POST request to `/api/customer/place_order`).
5) The order placement attempt returns a 400 status code, indicating a bad request and failure to convert the session into a completed order. 

This sequence concludes without a successful conversion, as the user did not complete the order placement due to the error encountered.
