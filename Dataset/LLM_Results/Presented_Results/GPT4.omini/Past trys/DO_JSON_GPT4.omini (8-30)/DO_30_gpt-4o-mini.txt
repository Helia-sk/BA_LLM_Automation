**Tag: Drop-Off [The user logged out without completing any significant actions or transactions.]**

**User Journey Step-by-Step:**
1) The user accessed the menu dashboard at `http://localhost:5173/restaurant/dashboard/menu`.
2) The user interacted with the dashboard by clicking the "Add Item" button multiple times, indicating an intention to modify the menu.
3) The user input text in a textarea but did not appear to complete a form or submit any data.
4) The user clicked the "Logout" button, which led to an API request to `/api/logout`.
5) The logout request was processed successfully with a 200 status code, indicating the user ended their session without any further actions or conversions. 

The sequence of actions indicates a user who engaged with the application but did not proceed to any meaningful conversion actions (like placing an order or completing a purchase) and ultimately chose to log out, signifying a drop-off in the user journey.
