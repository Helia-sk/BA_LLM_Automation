Tag: Drop-Off [The user did not complete the login process, as there are no logs indicating a successful login or submission of the login form.]

1) **User clicks on the "Customer Login" button** - Timestamp: 2025-09-13T11:41:35.638Z
2) **User enters their username** - The username input is recorded with the value "dkjhf" - Timestamp: 2025-09-13T11:41:39.767Z
3) **User blurs (clicks away from) the username input** - This action is logged, indicating that the user moved away from the username field - Timestamp: 2025-09-13T11:41:39.767Z
4) **User clicks on the password input field** - This action is logged, indicating that the user is now focused on entering their password - Timestamp: 2025-09-13T11:41:39.845Z
5) **User enters their password** - The password input is recorded with a length of 9 characters (value is hidden) - Timestamp: 2025-09-13T11:41:40.920Z
6) **User blurs the password input field** - This action indicates that the user has completed their input for the password - Timestamp: 2025-09-13T11:41:47.425Z

At this point, although the user has input both a username and password, there are no logs indicating a form submission or a redirection to a different page indicating a successful login. Thus, the session results in a drop-off.
