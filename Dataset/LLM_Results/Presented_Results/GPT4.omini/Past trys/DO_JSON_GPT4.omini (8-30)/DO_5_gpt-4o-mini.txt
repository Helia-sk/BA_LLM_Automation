Tag: Drop-Off [The session did not complete the login process as no successful authentication occurred.]

1) User navigates to the login page at `/customer/login`.
2) User clicks on the username input field.
3) User inputs the username "hi" (recorded as an input change).
4) User clicks on the password input field.
5) User attempts to input a password, but the password field is empty (finalValueLength is 0).
6) User clicks the "Sign In" button, but since no password was entered, the login attempt was incomplete.
7) User scrolls through the login page.
8) User interacts with a call-to-action button which leads to another page, but does not complete the login process.

Throughout the session, the user engaged with the login page but failed to enter valid credentials (username and password) for a successful login. Therefore, the session is classified as a drop-off.
