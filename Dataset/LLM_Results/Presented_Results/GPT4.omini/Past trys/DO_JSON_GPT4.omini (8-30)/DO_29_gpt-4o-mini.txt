Tag: Conversion [The session involved a sequence of actions that culminated in a logout, indicating that the user completed their interaction and likely achieved their goal.]

1) The user accessed the menu page (GET request to `/api/menu/`).
2) The user retrieved menu items successfully (HTTP response 200).
3) The user viewed and interacted with the menu (multiple GET requests to `/api/menu/`).
4) The user updated a menu item (PUT request to `/api/menu/18`).
5) The user received a response confirming the update (HTTP response 200).
6) The user clicked the "Save Changes" button, indicating confirmation of the updates.
7) The user submitted the changes through a form submit action.
8) The user then clicked the "Logout" button, triggering the logout process.
9) The logout request was sent (POST request to `/api/logout`).
10) The user received a successful logout response (HTTP response 200), indicating the session ended successfully. 

This sequence of actions suggests that the user completed their intended tasks (menu update and subsequent logout), leading to a conversion.
