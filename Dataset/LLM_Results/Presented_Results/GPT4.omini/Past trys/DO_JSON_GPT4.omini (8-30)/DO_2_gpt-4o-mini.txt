1) User arrived at the home page ("/") and began scrolling.  
2) User scrolled down the page, indicating some level of engagement with the content.  
3) User clicked on the "Customer Login" link, which led to the customer login page ("/customer/login").  
4) User then clicked on the "Restaurant Login" link, leading to the restaurant login page ("/restaurant/login").
