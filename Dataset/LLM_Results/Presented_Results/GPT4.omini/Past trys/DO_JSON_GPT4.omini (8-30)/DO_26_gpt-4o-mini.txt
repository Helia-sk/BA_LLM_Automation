Tag: Conversion||The session resulted in a series of successful logins and order retrievals, indicating that the user completed their intended actions.

1) User navigated to the login page and clicked on the "Sign In" button.
2) User entered the username "User1" and the password, triggering input changes and events for both fields.
3) User submitted the login form, which was successful, as indicated by the HTTP response with a status code of 200.
4) After logging in, the user accessed the orders page, retrieving their order information successfully as indicated by multiple GET requests to the "/api/orders/" endpoint, each returning a 200 status code.
5) The user then logged out successfully, completing the session with another POST request to the "/api/logout" endpoint, which also returned a 200 status code.

Overall, the user's journey indicates they successfully logged in, accessed their orders, and logged out, confirming a conversion rather than a drop-off.
