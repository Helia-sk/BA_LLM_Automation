==================================================

Tag: Drop-Off [The session does not show any evidence of a user successfully logging in or completing an action beyond the login page.]

1) User accesses the login page at `/customer/login`. 
2) User interacts with the username input field by clicking on it (input change event triggered).
3) User enters a username ("hi") into the username input field (input change event triggered).
4) User clicks on the "Sign In" button (click event triggered), attempting to log in.
5) There are no further events recorded after the "Sign In" button click, indicating that the session ended without a successful login or conversion action. 

The absence of a successful login event or a follow-up action confirms the session as a drop-off.
