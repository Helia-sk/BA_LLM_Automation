Tag: Conversion [The user successfully logged in and accessed their profile page.]

1) The user navigated to the login page (`/restaurant/login`).
2) The user entered the username (`User1`) and password (hidden input).
3) The user submitted the login form.
4) The user was redirected and successfully logged in, accessing the profile page (`/restaurant/dashboard/profile`).
5) The user clicked on the "Profile" button on their dashboard.
6) The user interacted with various elements on the profile page, including scrolling and input changes.

This sequence indicates that the user completed the login process and engaged with their profile, which constitutes a conversion rather than a drop-off.
