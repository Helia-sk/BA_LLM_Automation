2) The user clicked on a link to the restaurant login page (timestamp: 12:15:32).
3) The user clicked on the username input field (timestamp: 12:15:34) and began typing the username "d" (timestamp: 12:15:35).
4) The user completed the username input change (timestamp: 12:15:39).
5) The user clicked on the password input field (timestamp: 12:15:39) and entered a password (details hidden).
