Tag: Drop-Off [The session ends with a logout event without completing a purchase or any conversion activity.]

1) User visits the homepage and scrolls down.
2) User clicks on a button labeled "Hungry? Order delicious food from local restaurants."
3) User is directed to the login page and interacts with the login form:
   - Enters username ("User1").
   - Enters password (hidden).
   - Submits the login form.
4) User successfully logs in (no direct logged event confirming login success, but the sequence implies it).
5) User navigates to the customer dashboard and views the cart.
6) User interacts with the cart dashboard and logs out.

The session ends with a logout event, indicating that the user did not complete any conversion action such as placing an order or completing a purchase. This is why it is classified as a drop-off.
