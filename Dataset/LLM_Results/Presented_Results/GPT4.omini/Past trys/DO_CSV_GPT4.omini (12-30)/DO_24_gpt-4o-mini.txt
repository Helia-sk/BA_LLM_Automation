Tag: Conversion||User completed the login and navigated to settings.

1) User navigated to the login page (`/restaurant/login`) and clicked the "Sign In" button after entering their credentials.
2) User successfully logged in and was redirected to the dashboard.
3) User clicked on the "Settings" button in the dashboard, indicating engagement with the platform.
4) User interacted with the settings, including viewing and potentially modifying delivery areas and opening hours before logging out.
