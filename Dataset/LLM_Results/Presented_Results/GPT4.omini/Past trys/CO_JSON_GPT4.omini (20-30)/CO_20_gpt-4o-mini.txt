Tag: Conversion||[The user successfully logged in, placed an order, and completed the session.]

1) User clicks on the "Sign In" button on the login page.
2) The user enters their username ("User1") and password, and submits the login form.
3) User is authenticated with a 200 OK response from the login API.
4) User navigates to the customer dashboard.
5) User views their order history and customer orders, receiving 200 OK responses for those requests.
6) User places an order through the "place order" API, which returns a 201 Created response, indicating that the order was successfully placed.
7) User logs out, receiving another 200 OK response, indicating the session has ended successfully. 

This sequence of actions demonstrates a complete user journey from logging in to completing an order, confirming a successful conversion rather than a drop-off.
