Tag: Conversion [The session resulted in a successful form submission indicating that changes were made and saved in the menu.]

1) User navigated to the "/restaurant/dashboard/menu" page (click on "Menu").
2) User clicked on an input field to enter a value (input change event).
3) User entered a numeric value (0.04) in an input field and blurred the field.
4) User clicked the "Save Changes" button to submit the form.
5) A form submission event is logged, indicating that the form was submitted successfully. 
6) Server processes the request to update the menu item, resulting in a series of backend requests (PUT method) to update the item.
7) The server responds with a status code 200, confirming that the update was successful. 

This sequence indicates that the user completed the process intended for the dashboard, thus resulting in a conversion rather than a drop-off.
