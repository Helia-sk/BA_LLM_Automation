**Tag: Conversion||The session ended with a successful order placement (status code 201 for the POST request to place an order).**

**User Journey:**
1) User navigates to the customer login page (clicks "Customer Login" button).
2) User enters the username and password and submits the login form. The first attempt fails with status code 401 (unauthorized).
3) User successfully logs in (status code 200 response).
4) User views their order history by navigating to the orders section (GET request to `/api/customer/orders/`).
5) User accesses their order dashboard (GET request to `/api/customer/dashboard/orders/`).
6) User places an order by clicking the appropriate option (POST request to place an order with status code 201 indicating success).
7) User receives a confirmation of the order placement (indicated by the status code 201 response).

This sequence demonstrates a clear progression from logging in to successfully placing an order, which qualifies as a conversion.
