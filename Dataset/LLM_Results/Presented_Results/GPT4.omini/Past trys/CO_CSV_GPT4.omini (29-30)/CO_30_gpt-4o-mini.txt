Tag: Drop-Off [The session ended without a successful conversion action, such as completing an order or viewing a confirmation page.]

1) User navigated to the restaurant dashboard page (timestamp: 2025-09-27T15:20:35.792Z).
2) User clicked on the "History" button (timestamp: 2025-09-27T15:20:43.885Z).
3) User clicked on the "View Details" button (timestamp: 2025-09-27T15:20:45.667Z).
4) User clicked on the "X" button, presumably to close the details view (timestamp: 2025-09-27T15:20:49.152Z).
5) User clicked on another SVG element, but the action is unclear (timestamp: 2025-09-27T15:20:49.915Z).
6) User clicked the "Reject" button (timestamp: 2025-09-27T15:20:52.428Z).
7) Backend logs show the user attempted to reject an order (timestamp: 2025-09-27T17:20:52.750618) but this action resulted in an API call that indicates the rejection was processed (timestamp: 2025-09-27T17:20:52.767127).

The sequence indicates that while the user was actively engaged with the dashboard and interacted with various buttons, there was no final conversion event such as completing an order or receiving a confirmation, leading to the classification of this session as a drop-off.
