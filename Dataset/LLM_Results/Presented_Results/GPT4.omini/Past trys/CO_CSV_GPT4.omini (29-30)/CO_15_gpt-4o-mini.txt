4) The user is redirected to the dashboard (`/customer/dashboard`).
5) The user clicks on "Orders" to view their previous orders (`/customer/dashboard/orders`).
6) The user then views the details of a specific order from the orders list (`/customer/orders/25/details`).
7) The user navigates to the "Place Order" section to make a new order (`/customer/place_order`).
