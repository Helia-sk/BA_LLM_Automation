==================================================

Tag: Conversion||User completed the registration process.

1) User starts at the login page (`/restaurant/login`).
2) User clicks the input field for the username and starts typing (`input_change` events for the username field).
3) User continues to fill in their details by entering their name, street address, postal code, and description, as captured through multiple `input_change` events.
4) User clicks the "Create Account" button, indicating the intention to submit the registration form.
5) A final `form_submit` event is captured, confirming the submission of the registration form.
6) The server processes the request, and successful responses are received from the backend API, indicating that the account creation process has been completed successfully.

The user journey shows that the user engaged with the registration form and successfully submitted it, resulting in a conversion rather than a drop-off.
