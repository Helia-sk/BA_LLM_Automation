Tag: Conversion [The user successfully placed an order, indicating that they completed a desired action.]

1) The user navigated to the dashboard (/customer/dashboard).
2) The user clicked on the "Orders" link, which led them to the orders page (/customer/dashboard/orders).
3) The user then clicked on the "Cart" link, accessing their shopping cart (/customer/dashboard/cart).
4) They clicked to add an item from a restaurant page (/customer/dashboard/restaurant/8) to their cart.
5) After reviewing the cart, the user proceeded to the checkout process by clicking on "Place Order" (/customer/place_order).
6) The backend logs show successful interactions with the orders and place order API endpoints, confirming that the order was processed without errors.

The sequence of events shows a clear progression toward conversion from browsing to placing an order.
