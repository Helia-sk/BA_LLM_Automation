**Tag:** Conversion [The user submitted a form successfully, indicating they completed the desired action.]

**User Journey Step-by-Step:**
1) User accessed the restaurant dashboard menu at `http://localhost:5173/restaurant/dashboard/menu`.
2) User clicked to input data into various fields (timestamped clicks on empty input fields).
3) User changed the input in a numeric field (input value changed to `0.04`).
4) User clicked the "Save Changes" button to submit the form.
5) Form submission was recorded, indicating that the user completed their task on the menu.

Overall, the sequence of events shows that the user interacted with the form, filled in required fields, and successfully submitted the form, leading to a conversion rather than a drop-off.
