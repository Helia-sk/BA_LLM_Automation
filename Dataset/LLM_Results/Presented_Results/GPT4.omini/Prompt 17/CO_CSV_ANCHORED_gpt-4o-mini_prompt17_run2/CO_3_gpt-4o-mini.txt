Prompt: "Analyze the log file. Determine if the session was a drop-off or a conversion. Do not make a decision until you read all the logs. Consider every initiated task and both of the following conditions in your decision-making. If all initiated tasks are completed → Tag: Conversion. Even if one of the initiated tasks is abandoned → Tag: Drop-Off. Provide a reason for your classification. Then, outline the user journey step-by-step. Format your response as follows: Tag: your decision [Reason]. 1) [Step 1] 2) [Step 2] 3) [Step 3] … At the end, check if you considered all the logs to the end. Don’t guess or presume."
==================================================

Tag: Drop-Off [One of the initiated tasks was abandoned. The logs indicate an attempt to log in, but there is no log showing a successful completion of the login process.]

1) The user navigated to the login page (`/restaurant/login`).
2) The user clicked on the username field and entered their username (`User1`).
3) The user clicked on the password field and entered their password (though it is hidden in the logs).
4) The user submitted the login form by clicking the "Sign In" button.
5) The logs do not show a response indicating a successful login, which means the session did not complete the intended task of logging in.

At the end, I have considered all the logs provided. There is no evidence of the login being successful, which leads to the classification of this session as a drop-off.
