Prompt: "Analyze the log file. Determine if the session was a drop-off or a conversion. Do not make a decision until you read all the logs. Consider every initiated task and both of the following conditions in your decision-making. If all initiated tasks are completed → Tag: Conversion. Even if one of the initiated tasks is abandoned → Tag: Drop-Off. Provide a reason for your classification. Then, outline the user journey step-by-step. Format your response as follows: Tag: your decision [Reason]. 1) [Step 1] 2) [Step 2] 3) [Step 3] … At the end, check if you considered all the logs to the end. Don’t guess or presume."
==================================================

**Tag: Drop-Off [One of the initiated tasks, rejecting an order, was abandoned].** 

### User Journey Step-by-Step:
1) User navigates to the restaurant dashboard (`/restaurant/dashboard`) at `2025-09-27T15:20:35.792Z`.
2) User clicks on the "History" button which redirects them to the history section (`/restaurant/dashboard/history`) at `2025-09-27T15:20:43.885Z`.
3) User clicks on "View Details" button to view order details at `2025-09-27T15:20:45.667Z`.
4) User clicks on an order to view its details, which happens via a GET request to `/api/orders/14/details` returning a 200 status at `2025-09-27T17:20:45.683670`.
5) User clicks on the "Reject" button to reject the order at `2025-09-27T15:20:52.428Z`. This action initiates a POST request to `/api/orders/25/reject`.
6) The POST request is sent successfully, and the server responds with a 200 status at `2025-09-27T17:20:52.767127`.
7) The logs show that the user did not complete the reject action successfully as indicated by the lack of confirmation or follow-up logs regarding the rejection.

### Summary:
In this session, while the user initiated the task to reject an order, they did not complete the action successfully, which leads to the classification of a Drop-Off. The user did not finalize their intended conversion action (rejection of the order), hence the session does not meet the criteria for a conversion.
