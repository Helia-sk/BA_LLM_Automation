Prompt: "Analyze the log file. Determine if the session was a drop-off or a conversion. Do not make a decision until you read all the logs. Consider every initiated task and both of the following conditions in your decision-making. If all initiated tasks are completed → Tag: Conversion. Even if one of the initiated tasks is abandoned → Tag: Drop-Off. Provide a reason for your classification. Then, outline the user journey step-by-step. Format your response as follows: Tag: your decision [Reason]. 1) [Step 1] 2) [Step 2] 3) [Step 3] … At the end, check if you considered all the logs to the end. Don’t guess or presume."
==================================================

Tag: Conversion [All initiated tasks were completed successfully, leading to a successful registration.]

1) The user navigated to the login page of the restaurant application (`/restaurant/login`).
2) The user clicked on the "Create Account" button, initiating the registration process.
3) The user filled in the required fields – including username, name, street address, postal code, password, and a description.
4) The user submitted the registration form, triggering the system to respond with a success status (201 Created).
5) The backend confirmed that the user was successfully registered via the `register.register` endpoint.

Every initiated task was completed, resulting in a successful conversion. I have reviewed all logs and confirmed that the user journey led to a conversion without any tasks being abandoned.
