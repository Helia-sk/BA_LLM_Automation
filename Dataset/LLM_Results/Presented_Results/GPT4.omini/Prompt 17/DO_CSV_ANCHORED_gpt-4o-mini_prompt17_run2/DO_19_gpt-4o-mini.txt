Prompt: "Analyze the log file. Determine if the session was a drop-off or a conversion. Do not make a decision until you read all the logs. Consider every initiated task and both of the following conditions in your decision-making. If all initiated tasks are completed → Tag: Conversion. Even if one of the initiated tasks is abandoned → Tag: Drop-Off. Provide a reason for your classification. Then, outline the user journey step-by-step. Format your response as follows: Tag: your decision [Reason]. 1) [Step 1] 2) [Step 2] 3) [Step 3] … At the end, check if you considered all the logs to the end. Don’t guess or presume."
==================================================

Tag: Drop-Off [The session did not complete all initiated tasks as indicated by the abandonment of the 'postalCode' input field, which was left empty, resulting in an incomplete form submission.]

1) The user navigated to the login page at `/restaurant/login`.
2) The user entered their username ("User1") in the username field.
3) The user entered their password (which is hidden but indicated as input) and then clicked the "Sign In" button.
4) Upon successful login, the user navigated to the profile page at `/restaurant/dashboard/profile`.
5) The user began interacting with the profile page and specifically attempted to input a postal code but abandoned it, leaving the postal code field empty.
6) The user attempted to log out by clicking the logout button.

At the end of the log file, the user's journey shows that they started the process of entering a postal code but did not complete it, leading to the classification of the session as a drop-off. All logs have been considered.
