Prompt: "Analyze the log file. Determine if the session was a drop-off or a conversion. Do not make a decision until you read all the logs. Consider every initiated task and both of the following conditions in your decision-making. If all initiated tasks are completed → Tag: Conversion. Even if one of the initiated tasks is abandoned → Tag: Drop-Off. Provide a reason for your classification. Then, outline the user journey step-by-step. Format your response as follows: Tag: your decision [Reason]. 1) [Step 1] 2) [Step 2] 3) [Step 3] … At the end, check if you considered all the logs to the end. Don’t guess or presume."
==================================================

Tag: Drop-Off [The session was classified as a drop-off because not all initiated tasks were completed; specifically, the user did not complete the login process despite entering some input.]

1) User navigated to the homepage (http://localhost:5173/).
2) User clicked on a link to the restaurant login page (http://localhost:5173/restaurant/login).
3) User clicked on the username input field, which then triggered an input change event where they entered a single character 'd'.
4) User clicked on the password input field, but no password was entered (the input was empty).
5) User clicked the "Sign In" button, but since the password field was not filled in, the login attempt was incomplete.

At the end of the logs, it is verified that the user did not complete the login process, thus confirming the classification as a drop-off.
