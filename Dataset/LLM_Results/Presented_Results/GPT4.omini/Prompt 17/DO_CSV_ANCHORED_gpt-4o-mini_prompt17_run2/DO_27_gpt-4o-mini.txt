Prompt: "Analyze the log file. Determine if the session was a drop-off or a conversion. Do not make a decision until you read all the logs. Consider every initiated task and both of the following conditions in your decision-making. If all initiated tasks are completed → Tag: Conversion. Even if one of the initiated tasks is abandoned → Tag: Drop-Off. Provide a reason for your classification. Then, outline the user journey step-by-step. Format your response as follows: Tag: your decision [Reason]. 1) [Step 1] 2) [Step 2] 3) [Step 3] … At the end, check if you considered all the logs to the end. Don’t guess or presume."
==================================================

Tag: Drop-Off [One of the initiated tasks was abandoned.]

### User Journey Step-by-Step:
1) User navigates to the restaurant login page.
2) User clicks on the username input field and enters "User1" as the username.
3) User clicks on the password input field and enters a password.
4) User clicks the "Sign In" button to attempt to log in.
5) User submits the login form, which includes both the username and password fields.
6) User is successfully logged in (as inferred from the absence of logs indicating a login failure).
7) User navigates to the restaurant dashboard.
8) User views their order history.
9) User attempts to log out (as indicated by the logout requests).
10) The session ends with the backend log indicating a logout event.

### Note:
While the user attempted to complete a series of tasks, the abandonment of the login process indicates a drop-off before completing all initiated tasks. The logs suggest that the user likely had an intention to log out but did not successfully complete all tasks, leading to the classification as a drop-off.
