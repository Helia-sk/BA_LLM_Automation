Prompt: "Analyze the log file. Determine if the session was a drop-off or a conversion. Do not make a decision until you read all the logs. Consider every initiated task and both of the following conditions in your decision-making. If all initiated tasks are completed → Tag: Conversion. Even if one of the initiated tasks is abandoned → Tag: Drop-Off. Provide a reason for your classification. Then, outline the user journey step-by-step. Format your response as follows: Tag: your decision [Reason]. 1) [Step 1] 2) [Step 2] 3) [Step 3] … At the end, check if you considered all the logs to the end. Don’t guess or presume."
