Prompt: "Analyze the log file. Determine if the session was a drop-off or a conversion. Do not make a decision until you read all the logs. Consider every initiated task and both of the following conditions in your decision-making. If all initiated tasks are completed → Tag: Conversion. Even if one of the initiated tasks is abandoned → Tag: Drop-Off. Provide a reason for your classification. Then, outline the user journey step-by-step. Format your response as follows: Tag: your decision [Reason]. 1) [Step 1] 2) [Step 2] 3) [Step 3] … At the end, check if you considered all the logs to the end. Don’t guess or presume."
==================================================

**Tag: Drop-Off [One of the initiated tasks was abandoned.]**

1) The user accessed the login page at `http://localhost:5173/restaurant/login`.
2) The user entered the username "User" and later "User1" in the username field.
3) The user interacted with the password field, entering a password but not completing the login (as evidenced by not seeing any logs confirming a successful login).
4) The user clicked to submit the login form.
5) A response from the server indicates that the login was successful (`POST /api/login` with status 200), but the session ended with a logout request, which indicates abandonment of the session.
6) The user navigated to the profile dashboard but did not complete any further tasks on the profile page.
7) The user logged out, confirming they did not complete any further goals within the session.

Throughout the session, while the user did initiate multiple tasks related to logging in and navigating to their profile, the final action of logging out indicates that they did not complete the overall flow of using the application for its intended purpose, leading to a classification as a drop-off. 

I have considered all the logs provided to the end.
