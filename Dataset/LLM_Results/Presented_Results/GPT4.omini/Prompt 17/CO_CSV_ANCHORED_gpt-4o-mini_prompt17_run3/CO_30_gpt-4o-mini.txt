Prompt: "Analyze the log file. Determine if the session was a drop-off or a conversion. Do not make a decision until you read all the logs. Consider every initiated task and both of the following conditions in your decision-making. If all initiated tasks are completed → Tag: Conversion. Even if one of the initiated tasks is abandoned → Tag: Drop-Off. Provide a reason for your classification. Then, outline the user journey step-by-step. Format your response as follows: Tag: your decision [Reason]. 1) [Step 1] 2) [Step 2] 3) [Step 3] … At the end, check if you considered all the logs to the end. Don’t guess or presume."
==================================================

Tag: Drop-Off [The user abandoned one of the initiated tasks, which led to the classification as a drop-off.]

1) The user initiated a session by viewing the restaurant dashboard (`page_view` event).
2) The user clicked on the "History" button to view the order history.
3) The user clicked on the "View Details" button from the history section.
4) The user then clicked on the "X" button presumably to close a detail view.
5) The user attempted to reject an order (`/api/orders/25/reject`) but did not complete this action as indicated by the logs, suggesting the task was abandoned.
6) The session included multiple requests and responses for rejecting an order, but since the task of rejecting the order was not completed, it indicates a failure to convert.

All logs have been considered to the end. The reasoning is based strictly on the completion of tasks, and since one task was abandoned, the session is classified as a drop-off.
