Prompt: "Analyze the log file. Determine if the session was a drop-off or a conversion. Do not make a decision until you read all the logs. Consider every initiated task and both of the following conditions in your decision-making. If all initiated tasks are completed → Tag: Conversion. Even if one of the initiated tasks is abandoned → Tag: Drop-Off. Provide a reason for your classification. Then, outline the user journey step-by-step. Format your response as follows: Tag: your decision [Reason]. 1) [Step 1] 2) [Step 2] 3) [Step 3] … At the end, check if you considered all the logs to the end. Don’t guess or presume."
==================================================

**Tag: Drop-Off [One of the initiated tasks was abandoned.]**

1) The user navigated to the /api/menu/ endpoint and received the initial response, which indicates the menu was loaded.
2) The user then initiated a request to /api/menu/18, which was successfully processed.
3) After that, the user interacted with the frontend by clicking on various elements related to the menu, including inputs and buttons.
4) The user attempted to fill out a form on the /restaurant/dashboard/menu page, where they used an input field and attempted to submit the form.
5) The form submit event indicates that the user interacted with the form elements, but the details show that the form submission did not complete successfully due to a field marked as "isAvailable": false. This suggests that a required field was not completed correctly.
6) Despite multiple interactions, the absence of a successful form submission indicates that not all initiated tasks were completed.

In summary, since one of the initiated tasks (form submission) was abandoned without successful completion, the session is classified as a drop-off.
