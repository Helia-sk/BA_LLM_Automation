Prompt: "Analyze the log file. Determine if the session was a drop-off or a conversion. Do not make a decision until you read all the logs. Consider every initiated task and both of the following conditions in your decision-making. If all initiated tasks are completed → Tag: Conversion. Even if one of the initiated tasks is abandoned → Tag: Drop-Off. Provide a reason for your classification. Then, outline the user journey step-by-step. Format your response as follows: Tag: your decision [Reason]. 1) [Step 1] 2) [Step 2] 3) [Step 3] … At the end, check if you considered all the logs to the end. Don’t guess or presume."
==================================================

Tag: Drop-Off [One of the initiated tasks was abandoned.]

1) User navigates to the login page and submits their credentials (username and password).
2) User clicks the "Sign In" button to attempt logging in.
3) User interacts with the password field, indicating engagement with the login form.
4) User clicks the "History" button, accessing the dashboard.
5) User clicks the "View Details" button, indicating an interest in specific order details.
6) User completes the action of marking an order as completed, which is confirmed by a successful backend response (status code 200).
7) However, the logs indicate a drop-off since there was an abandonment of the login process (as indicated by the form_submit event without a subsequent successful login response).

I have considered all logs to the end.
