Prompt: "Analyze the log file. Determine if the session was a drop-off or a conversion. Do not make a decision until you read all the logs. Consider every initiated task and both of the following conditions in your decision-making. If all initiated tasks are completed → Tag: Conversion. Even if one of the initiated tasks is abandoned → Tag: Drop-Off. Provide a reason for your classification. Then, outline the user journey step-by-step. Format your response as follows: Tag: your decision [Reason]. 1) [Step 1] 2) [Step 2] 3) [Step 3] … At the end, check if you considered all the logs to the end. Don’t guess or presume."

**Tag: Conversion [All initiated tasks were completed successfully. The user logged in, viewed orders, and logged out without abandoning any tasks.]**

### User Journey Step-by-Step:
1) The user clicks on the "Customer Login" button to initiate the login process.
2) The user enters their username ("User1") and password, and submits the login form.
3) The system responds with a successful login (HTTP status code 200).
4) The user clicks on the "Orders" link to view their orders.
5) The system retrieves and displays the user's orders successfully (HTTP status code 200).
6) The user logs out by clicking the "Logout" button.
7) The system responds with a successful logout (HTTP status code 200).

All initiated tasks (login, view orders, and logout) were completed successfully without any abandonment. Thus, the session is classified as a conversion.
