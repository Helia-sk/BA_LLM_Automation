Prompt: "Analyze the log file. Determine if the session was a drop-off or a conversion. Do not make a decision until you read all the logs. Consider every initiated task and both of the following conditions in your decision-making. If all initiated tasks are completed → Tag: Conversion. Even if one of the initiated tasks is abandoned → Tag: Drop-Off. Provide a reason for your classification. Then, outline the user journey step-by-step. Format your response as follows: Tag: your decision [Reason]. 1) [Step 1] 2) [Step 2] 3) [Step 3] … At the end, check if you considered all the logs to the end. Don’t guess or presume."

1) User visits the login page and interacts with the username input field, entering "User1".
2) User interacts with the password input field, entering a password.
3) User submits the login form.

5) User navigates to the dashboard (indicated by frontend logs of button clicks).
6) User views their restaurant amount, which is €0.04.
7) User clicks on the "Orders" button, indicating intent to view orders.
8) Multiple requests are sent to fetch orders, and the system responds successfully (status code 200).
9) User attempts to log out (indicated by frontend click logs for the logout button).
10) There are logs indicating a POST request to the logout endpoint, which is successful (status code 200).
11) The session appears to end with the logout, implying the user did not complete any further tasks after deciding to log out.
