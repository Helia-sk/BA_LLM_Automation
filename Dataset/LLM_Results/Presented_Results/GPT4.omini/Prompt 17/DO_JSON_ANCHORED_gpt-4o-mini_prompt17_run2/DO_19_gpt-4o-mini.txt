Prompt: "Analyze the log file. Determine if the session was a drop-off or a conversion. Do not make a decision until you read all the logs. Consider every initiated task and both of the following conditions in your decision-making. If all initiated tasks are completed → Tag: Conversion. Even if one of the initiated tasks is abandoned → Tag: Drop-Off. Provide a reason for your classification. Then, outline the user journey step-by-step. Format your response as follows: Tag: your decision [Reason]. 1) [Step 1] 2) [Step 2] 3) [Step 3] … At the end, check if you considered all the logs to the end. Don’t guess or presume."
==================================================

Tag: Drop-Off [The session included multiple initiated tasks, including a login attempt and input changes for username and password. However, there are no logs indicating that the login task was successfully completed, which implies an abandonment of the task.]

1) The user clicked on the "Restaurant PartnersRegister your restaurant or log in to manage orders" button, which indicates an intention to log in.
2) The user was directed to the login page (`/restaurant/login`).
3) The user entered the username "User1" and the password (hidden), indicating that they were filling out the login form.
4) The user submitted the login form but there is no log indicating that the login was successful, as the response for the login attempt is missing.
5) The user logged out shortly after attempting to log in, indicating that they abandoned the session without successfully completing the login task.

After analyzing all logs, it is clear that the login task was not completed, resulting in a session drop-off.
