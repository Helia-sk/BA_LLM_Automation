Prompt: "Analyze the log file. Determine if the session was a drop-off or a conversion. Do not make a decision until you read all the logs. Consider every initiated task and both of the following conditions in your decision-making. If all initiated tasks are completed → Tag: Conversion. Even if one of the initiated tasks is abandoned → Tag: Drop-Off. Provide a reason for your classification. Then, outline the user journey step-by-step. Format your response as follows: Tag: your decision [Reason]. 1) [Step 1] 2) [Step 2] 3) [Step 3] … At the end, check if you considered all the logs to the end. Don’t guess or presume."
==================================================

Tag: Drop-Off [The user did not complete the login process as they did not successfully navigate to the customer dashboard after logging in. The logout event indicates they abandoned the session.]

1) The user navigated to the homepage (`/`).
2) The user clicked on "Customer Login" and was directed to the login page (`/customer/login`).
3) The user entered their username "User1" and attempted to log in by clicking the "Sign In" button.
4) The login request was processed successfully, indicated by a `200` status code.
5) After successful login, the user was expected to navigate to the customer dashboard, but the logs indicate that they initiated a logout immediately after the login response, which shows that they did not complete the journey and abandoned the session.

The series of logs has been thoroughly reviewed, confirming that all relevant events have been considered. The session is classified as a drop-off due to the user abandoning their intended task of navigating to the dashboard after logging in.
