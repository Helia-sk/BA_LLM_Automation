Prompt: "Analyze the log file. Determine if the session was a drop-off or a conversion. Do not make a decision until you read all the logs. Consider every initiated task and both of the following conditions in your decision-making. If all initiated tasks are completed → Tag: Conversion. Even if one of the initiated tasks is abandoned → Tag: Drop-Off. Provide a reason for your classification. Then, outline the user journey step-by-step. Format your response as follows: Tag: your decision [Reason]. 1) [Step 1] 2) [Step 2] 3) [Step 3] … At the end, check if you considered all the logs to the end. Don’t guess or presume."
==================================================

**Tag: Drop-Off [Reason: One of the initiated tasks (login) was abandoned].**

### User Journey Step-by-Step:
1) The user accesses the restaurant login page by clicking the "Restaurant Login" button.
2) The user is presented with a login form and begins inputting their username ("User").
3) The user continues to input their username and sees feedback as they type.
4) The user inputs their password but does not complete the login submission.
5) The user interacts with the login button to attempt signing in.
6) The user cancels or does not proceed with the login action based on the logs indicating a click on "Cancel" and no subsequent successful login attempt was recorded.

### Logs Considered:
I have reviewed all logs until the end and confirmed that there are no completed tasks for the session. The user initiated a login task but abandoned it, leading to the classification as a drop-off.
