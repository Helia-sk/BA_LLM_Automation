Even if one of the initiated tasks is abandoned → Tag: Drop-Off. Provide a reason for your classification. Then, outline the user journey step-by-step. Format your response as follows: Tag: your decision [Reason]. 1) [Step 1] 2) [Step 2] 3) [Step 3] … At the end, check if you considered all the logs to the end. Don’t guess or presume."

Tag: Drop-Off [The user abandoned the Customer Login task after initiating it, which classifies the session as a drop-off.]

1) The user first visited the homepage (/) and initiated a scroll action (logged at 11:40:05.641).
2) The user then performed another scroll action (logged at 11:40:06.219) on the homepage.
3) The user clicked on the "Customer Login" link (logged at 11:40:07.141), initiating the customer login task.
4) The user then clicked on the "Restaurant Login" link (logged at 11:40:09.230), indicating a switch to a different task.
5) There are no logs indicating that the user completed either login task, suggesting that they did not proceed further with either login action.

The user initiated two tasks (Customer Login and Restaurant Login) but did not complete any, leading to the classification of the session as a drop-off.
