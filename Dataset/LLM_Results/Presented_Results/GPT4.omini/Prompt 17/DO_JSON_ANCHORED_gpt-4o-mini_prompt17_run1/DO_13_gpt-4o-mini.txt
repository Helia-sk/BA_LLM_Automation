Prompt: "Analyze the log file. Determine if the session was a drop-off or a conversion. Do not make a decision until you read all the logs. Consider every initiated task and both of the following conditions in your decision-making. If all initiated tasks are completed → Tag: Conversion. Even if one of the initiated tasks is abandoned → Tag: Drop-Off. Provide a reason for your classification. Then, outline the user journey step-by-step. Format your response as follows: Tag: your decision [Reason]. 1) [Step 1] 2) [Step 2] 3) [Step 3] … At the end, check if you considered all the logs to the end. Don’t guess or presume."

**Tag: Drop-Off [The presence of abandoned tasks indicates that not all tasks were completed.]**

### User Journey Step-by-Step:

2) The user entered their username (`User1`) into the username field.
3) The user entered their password into the password field.
4) The user clicked the "Sign In" button to submit the login form.
5) The login attempt was successful as indicated by a 200 status code in the logs.
6) The user then accessed the customer dashboard and viewed a restaurant page.
7) The user added items to their cart, as indicated by multiple "Added" click events.
8) The user proceeded to view the cart page at `http://localhost:5173/customer/dashboard/cart`.
9) The user clicked to logout, completing the logout process successfully as indicated by a 200 status code in the logs.

**Final Check:**
All logs were considered, and the decision was based on the presence of abandoned tasks, leading to the classification of the session as a Drop-Off.
