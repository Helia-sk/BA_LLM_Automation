==================================================

Tag: conversion [User successfully logged in and made a request to view orders.]

1) User clicked on "Restaurant Login" to navigate to the login page.
2) User inputted username and password and submitted the login form.
3) The login request was processed successfully with a status code of 200.
4) User made a subsequent request to view orders, also receiving a successful response (status code 200). 

This sequence indicates that the user completed the login process and accessed their orders, qualifying as a conversion rather than a drop-off.
