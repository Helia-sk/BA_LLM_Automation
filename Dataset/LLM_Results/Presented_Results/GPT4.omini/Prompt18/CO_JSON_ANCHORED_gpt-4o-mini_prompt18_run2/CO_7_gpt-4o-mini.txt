==================================================

Tag: conversion [The session included a successful login and subsequent order placement.]

1) The user initiated a login attempt through a POST request to `/api/customer/login`, which returned a 200 status code, indicating a successful login.
2) After logging in, the user viewed their orders through multiple GET requests to `/api/customer/orders/`, all of which returned a status code of 200.
3) The user proceeded to place an order with a POST request to `/api/customer/place_order`, which returned a 201 status code, confirming the order was successfully created. 

The sequence of events demonstrates that this session resulted in a successful user login and order placement, indicating a conversion rather than a drop-off.
