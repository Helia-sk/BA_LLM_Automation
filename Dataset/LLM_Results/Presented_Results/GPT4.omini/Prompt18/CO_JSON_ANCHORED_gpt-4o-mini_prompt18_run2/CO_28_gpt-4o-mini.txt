==================================================

Tag: conversion [The session successfully completed an order with a 200 status code indicating success on the final step.]

1) The user visited the order completion endpoint (`/api/orders/26/complete`) with a POST request, which suggests an attempt to finalize a transaction.
2) The log shows a successful HTTP response with a status code of 200 for the order completion, indicating that the transaction was successfully processed.
3) Prior to the completion, the user retrieved order details successfully, indicating they were engaged in the purchasing process.
4) The sequence suggests that the user initiated an order, viewed details, and completed the order, indicating a successful conversion rather than a drop-off. 

Overall, the session points to a successful conversion through the completion of an order.
