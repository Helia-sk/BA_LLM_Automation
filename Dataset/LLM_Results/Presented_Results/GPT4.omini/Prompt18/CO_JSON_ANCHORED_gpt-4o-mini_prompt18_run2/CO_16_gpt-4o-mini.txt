==================================================

Tag: conversion [The session resulted in a successful order placement.]

1) User initiated a login process, successfully logging in with a status code of 200.
2) User accessed their order history via the `GET` request to `/api/customer/dashboard/orders/` and received a successful response (status code 200).
3) User placed an order with a `POST` request to `/api/customer/place_order`, resulting in a successful response with a status code of 201, indicating a new resource was created (the order was placed).
4) User logged out successfully with a status code of 200.

This sequence of actions indicates that the user completed the login and placed an order, leading to a conversion rather than a drop-off.
