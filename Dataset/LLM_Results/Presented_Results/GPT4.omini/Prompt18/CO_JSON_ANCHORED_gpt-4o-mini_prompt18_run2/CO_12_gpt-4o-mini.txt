==================================================

Tag: Conversion [The session resulted in successfully adding a menu item, indicated by the 201 status code from the POST request.]

1) The session initiated with a form submission event to add a menu item at the endpoint `/restaurant/dashboard/menu`.
2) The user interacted with various input fields (text, textarea, number) and performed multiple clicks on buttons, indicating engagement with the form.
3) The backend processed a POST request to `/api/menu/` and returned a status code of 201, which signifies that a new resource (menu item) was successfully created.
4) Additional GET requests to fetch menu items confirm that the item was added and the user followed through with the intended action. 

Overall, the series of events indicate a successful conversion rather than a drop-off.
