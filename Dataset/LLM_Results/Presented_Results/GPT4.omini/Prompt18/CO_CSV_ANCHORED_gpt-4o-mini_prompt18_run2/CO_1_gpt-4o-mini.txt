Prompt: "Analyze the log file. Determine if the session was a drop-off or a conversion.Format your response as follows: Tag: your decision  [Reason]. 1) [Step 1] 2) [Step 2] 3) [Step 3] …"
==================================================

Tag: drop-off [User did not successfully log in.]

1) User navigates to the login page (`/customer/login`).
2) User inputs their username (`User1`) and password (which is hidden).
3) User submits the form by clicking the "Sign In" button.
4) The login attempt is made (`http_request` to `/api/customer/login`).
5) The backend responds but does not indicate a successful authentication.
6) No further actions or conversions are recorded after the login attempt.

The absence of a successful login response indicates that the session did not convert; therefore, it is classified as a drop-off.
