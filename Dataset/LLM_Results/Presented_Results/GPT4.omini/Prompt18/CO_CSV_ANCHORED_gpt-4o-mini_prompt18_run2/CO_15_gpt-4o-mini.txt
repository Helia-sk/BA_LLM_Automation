==================================================

Tag: Conversion [The session successfully completed the login and proceeded to place orders.]

1) The user initiated a login action at `/customer/login` and successfully submitted the form with valid credentials.
2) After logging in, the user navigated to the dashboard and viewed their cart at `/customer/dashboard/cart`.
3) The user accessed their order history at `/customer/dashboard/orders`.
4) The user placed an order at `/customer/place_order`, indicating a completed conversion action. 

This sequence shows that the user did not drop off but instead completed the intended actions, leading to a conversion.
