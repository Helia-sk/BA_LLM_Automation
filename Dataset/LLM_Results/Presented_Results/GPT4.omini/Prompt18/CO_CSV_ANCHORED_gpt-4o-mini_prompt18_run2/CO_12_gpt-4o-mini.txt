==================================================

Tag: conversion [The session involved multiple user actions that indicate engagement and submission of a form.]

1) User clicked on the menu button to access the dashboard.
2) User inputted data into various fields (number, text area) indicating they were filling out a form.
3) User clicked the "Add Item" button to submit the form, which is a clear action towards conversion.
4) User submitted the form successfully, demonstrating completion of the intended action.

The sequence of these actions suggests that the session ultimately resulted in a conversion rather than a drop-off.
