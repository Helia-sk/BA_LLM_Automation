==================================================

Tag: Conversion [The session has a series of input changes and clicks that indicate the user is completing a registration process.]

1) User clicks to create an account on the login page.
2) User inputs their username ("user2").
3) User inputs their street address ("Schemkesweg 41").
4) User inputs their postal code ("47057").
5) User inputs their name ("Bestresever").
6) User inputs a description ("Hello").
7) User submits the form with all required fields filled.

The sequential actions demonstrate engagement with form fields and an intention to complete the registration process, indicating a conversion rather than a drop-off.
