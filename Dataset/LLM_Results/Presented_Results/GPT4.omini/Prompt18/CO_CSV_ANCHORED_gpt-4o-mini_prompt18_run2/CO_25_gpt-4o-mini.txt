==================================================

Tag: drop-off [The session does not show any conversion event, only menu API calls and frontend clicks without a successful transaction or goal completion.]

1) The session includes multiple backend HTTP requests to the menu API, indicating interaction with the menu.
2) There are frontend click events, but they do not lead to a conversion (e.g., no successful order placement or checkout event).
3) The absence of any final conversion events suggests the user did not complete a desired action, leading to a drop-off scenario.
