==================================================

Tag: Conversion [The user successfully logged in and proceeded to interact with the menu and order functionalities, indicating successful engagement with the platform.]

1) User initiated a login attempt via the /api/login route.
2) User successfully logged in (confirmed by the successful HTTP response).
3) User proceeded to interact with the menu, including adding items and managing orders, as indicated by several clicks and input changes in the dashboard menu.
4) User clicked the logout button, which typically indicates completion of their session, but the preceding actions demonstrate significant engagement. 

Overall, the session reflects a conversion rather than a drop-off as the user completed the login process and engaged with key functionalities of the application.
