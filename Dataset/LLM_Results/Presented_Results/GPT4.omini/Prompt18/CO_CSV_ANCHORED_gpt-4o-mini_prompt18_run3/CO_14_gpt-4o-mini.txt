1) User navigated to the login page (/customer/login) and submitted the login form successfully, which is indicated by the form submission event logged at `2025-09-27T14:06:44.757Z`.
2) After logging in, the user accessed the dashboard and interacted with the cart, as shown by multiple click events on the cart page (/customer/dashboard/cart) starting from `2025-09-27T14:07:15.381Z`.
3) The user also interacted with an order placement process, engaging with the place order API at `/api/customer/place_order` multiple times, with successful backend responses logged.
