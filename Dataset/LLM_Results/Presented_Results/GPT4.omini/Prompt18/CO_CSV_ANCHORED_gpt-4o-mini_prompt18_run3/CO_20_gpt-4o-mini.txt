1) User initiated a login attempt by clicking the "Sign In" button.
2) The login form was submitted successfully, confirming the user's credentials.
3) The user navigated to the customer dashboard, indicating continued engagement with the platform.
4) The user accessed the cart and the orders section, further demonstrating interaction and interest in the site’s offerings.

Overall, the sequence of actions indicates that the user completed the login process and engaged with the website afterward, which qualifies as a conversion rather than a drop-off.
