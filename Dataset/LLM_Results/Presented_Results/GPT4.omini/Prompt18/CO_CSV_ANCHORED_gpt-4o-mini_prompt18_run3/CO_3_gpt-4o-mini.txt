==================================================

Tag: conversion [The session includes successful form submissions indicating user engagement and intent to log in.]

1) The session starts with a user attempting to log in via the `/restaurant/login` route.
2) The user interacts with the login form by providing a username ("User1") and a password (hidden in the logs).
3) The user successfully submits the form, as indicated by the `form_submit` log event.
4) Subsequent logs show HTTP requests and responses related to the `/api/login` endpoint, suggesting that the login attempt was processed.

This sequence of events indicates that the user completed the login process, marking the session as a conversion.
