==================================================

Tag: drop-off [The session did not complete a conversion; it appears the user attempted to log in but did not successfully submit their credentials.]

1) The user clicked on the "Restaurant Login" link.
2) The user entered a username ("dd") in the username field.
3) The user entered a password (hidden) in the password field.
4) The user attempted to interact with the login button but did not complete the submission as there are no logs indicating a successful login event after entering the credentials. 

Overall, the user's session ended without completing the login process, indicating a drop-off.
