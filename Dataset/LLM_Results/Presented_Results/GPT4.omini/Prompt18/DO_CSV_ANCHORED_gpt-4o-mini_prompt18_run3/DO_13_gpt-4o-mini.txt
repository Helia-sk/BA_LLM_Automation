==================================================

Tag: conversion [User successfully logged in and interacted with the dashboard].

1) User navigated to the login page (`/customer/login`) and filled in credentials.
2) User clicked the "Sign In" button, which indicates an attempt to convert from a visitor to a registered user.
3) User successfully logged in, as evidenced by subsequent interactions on the dashboard (e.g., scrolling and clicking on various items).
4) User performed several actions including exploring the restaurant dashboard and adding items to the cart, which further confirms engagement and conversion. 

Overall, the sequence of events shows that the user not only logged in but also engaged with the platform actively thereafter, indicating a successful conversion rather than a drop-off.
