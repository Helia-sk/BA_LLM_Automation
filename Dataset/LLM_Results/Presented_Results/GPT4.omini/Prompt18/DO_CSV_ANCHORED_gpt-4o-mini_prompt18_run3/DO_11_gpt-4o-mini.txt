==================================================

Tag: conversion [The user successfully logged in after providing credentials.]

1) The user initiated a login process by clicking on the "Customer Login" button (`/customer/login`).
2) The user entered their username and password, which both had values (as indicated by the `field_presence_map`).
3) The login form was submitted successfully, as indicated by the `form_submit` log with a valid URL and action.
4) The user was directed to the `/customer/dashboard/orders` page, indicating that they successfully logged in and accessed their orders.

Based on these steps, this session represents a conversion rather than a drop-off.
