==================================================

Tag: Conversion [The user successfully logged in and interacted with the application, indicating engagement and progression through the session.]

1) User initiated a login by clicking the "Sign In" button.
2) User entered their username and password through input fields.
3) User submitted the login form, indicating intent to access the system.
4) Subsequent logs indicate user engagement with the application (e.g., navigating to the profile dashboard).

This sequence suggests that the session resulted in a successful conversion rather than a drop-off.
