==================================================

Tag: drop-off [The session did not complete a successful login, as there is no indication of a submission event or confirmation of login success after entering credentials.]

1) User clicked on the username field (log_1757763697593_pj1ybdrw2) and entered the username "dkjhf" (log_1757763699210_kwlundlwi).
2) User entered the password (log_1757763700920_fcl31v4ry) but there is no record of a submit action or a successful login event.
3) The last recorded actions were input changes for both username and password, with no indication that the user proceeded to submit the form (log_1757763707425_gdlpkgw6x). 

Overall, the lack of a submission event suggests that the user did not complete the login process.
