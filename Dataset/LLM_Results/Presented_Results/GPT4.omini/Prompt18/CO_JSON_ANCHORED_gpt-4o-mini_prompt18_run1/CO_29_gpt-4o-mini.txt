==================================================

Tag: conversion [The session resulted in a successful form submission that led to changes being saved or processed.]

1) User clicked the "Settings" button to navigate to the settings page.
2) User interacted with various input fields, including entering values and clicking buttons such as "Add" and "Submit Changes."
3) The session included multiple successful backend responses (status code 200) indicating that the subsequent requests were processed successfully.
4) The user submitted a form that triggered a backend response to update opening hours, which is indicative of a successful conversion action.

Overall, the series of actions demonstrates that the user completed the intended task (updating settings), indicating conversion rather than a drop-off.
