1) User logs in successfully with a POST request to `/api/customer/login`, receiving a 200 status code.
2) User views their orders via a series of GET requests to `/api/customer/orders/`, all returning 200 status codes.
3) User places an order with a POST request to `/api/customer/place_order`, receiving a 201 status code, indicating successful order creation.
