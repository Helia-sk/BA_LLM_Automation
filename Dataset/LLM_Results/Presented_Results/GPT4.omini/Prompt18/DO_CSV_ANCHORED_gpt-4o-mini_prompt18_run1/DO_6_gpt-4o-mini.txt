==================================================

Tag: conversion [User interacted with the login form and input fields, indicating an attempt to create an account.]

1) The session started with a click event on the main page, indicating user engagement.
2) The user navigated to the login page and interacted with various input fields, changing input values and clicking buttons associated with creating an account.
3) The user filled in details such as first name, last name, street address, postal code, and password, which signifies an intent to complete the registration process.
4) Multiple input changes were recorded with valid data entry (e.g., username and password), showing the user was actively engaged in the form-filling process.
5) The user clicked the "Create Account" button, which is the final step in the conversion process, indicating they intended to complete the account creation.

This sequence of actions demonstrates a clear path towards conversion rather than drop-off.
