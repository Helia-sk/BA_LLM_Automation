==================================================

Tag: Conversion [The session included a successful login followed by interactions in the dashboard settings.]

1) User clicked on "Restaurant Login" to access the login page.
2) User entered their username and password, indicating they were engaged in the login process.
3) User clicked the "Sign In" button, successfully logging into the system.
4) User interacted with the dashboard settings, performing various actions including scrolling and clicking buttons to modify settings.

The presence of successful login events and subsequent activity in the dashboard suggests that the session led to a conversion rather than a drop-off.
