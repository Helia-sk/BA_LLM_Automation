==================================================

Tag: Conversion [The session included a successful login and subsequent actions indicating user engagement.]

1) User initiated a login action by clicking the "Sign In" button.
2) User filled in the username and password fields, indicating intention to log in.
3) The user successfully logged in, as indicated by the sequence of login events.
4) After logging in, the user navigated to the settings and orders sections, confirming engagement with the application.

This sequence of actions suggests that the session resulted in a conversion rather than a drop-off.
