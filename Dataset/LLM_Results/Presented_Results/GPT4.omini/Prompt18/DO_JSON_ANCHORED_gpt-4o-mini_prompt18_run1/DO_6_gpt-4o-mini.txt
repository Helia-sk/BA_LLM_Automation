==================================================

Tag: conversion [The session indicates user engagement with multiple input fields and trigger actions leading towards account creation.]

1) User visits the login page (`/customer/login`).
2) User clicks on the "Create Account" button, indicating intent to convert.
3) User inputs username (`sdj`) and first name (`dd`), and last name (`dd`).
4) User inputs street address and postal code (`dd`).
5) User enters a password.
6) User continues interactions with multiple input changes and clicks, suggesting they are filling out the registration form.
7) User interacts with other elements on the page, indicating a continued interest in completing the process.

The logged actions reflect a flow towards account creation, rather than dropping off before completing the form.
