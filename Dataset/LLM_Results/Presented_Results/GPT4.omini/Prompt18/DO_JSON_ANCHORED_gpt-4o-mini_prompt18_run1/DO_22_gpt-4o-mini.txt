==================================================

Tag: Conversion [User successfully logged in and interacted with the menu and orders.]

1) User navigated to the login page at "http://localhost:5173/restaurant/login" and submitted the login form with valid credentials (username and password).
2) The login endpoint "/api/login" returned a 200 status code, indicating successful authentication.
3) After logging in, the user accessed the menu items via the endpoint "/api/menu/" and received a successful response (200 status code).
4) The user then interacted with the orders endpoint "/api/orders/", receiving successful responses (200 status codes) for fetching orders.

The sequence of events demonstrates a successful conversion, as the user completed the login process and proceeded to interact with the application's features.
