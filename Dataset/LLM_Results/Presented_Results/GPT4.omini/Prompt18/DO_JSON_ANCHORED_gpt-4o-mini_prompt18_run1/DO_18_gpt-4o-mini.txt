==================================================

Tag: conversion [User successfully logged in and accessed orders].  
1) User clicked on "Customer Login" at 12:21:08.  
2) User submitted the login form at 12:20:46.522, successfully logging in (HTTP 200 response).  
3) User accessed orders at 12:20:47 (HTTP 200 response).  
4) User logged out at 14:21:07 (HTTP 200 response).  

The sequence of events demonstrates that the user completed the login process, accessed the orders, and then logged out, indicating a successful conversion rather than a drop-off.
