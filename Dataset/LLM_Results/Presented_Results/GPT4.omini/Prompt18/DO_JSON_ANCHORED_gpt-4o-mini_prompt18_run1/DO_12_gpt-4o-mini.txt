==================================================

Tag: conversion [User successfully logged in and then proceeded to view orders and logout.]

1) The user initiated a login action by submitting their credentials (username and password) at "2025-09-13T12:06:29.828Z".
2) The login was successful, indicated by a "200" status code response from the server (timestamp "2025-09-13T14:06:30.780052").
3) After logging in, the user accessed their orders at "2025-09-13T14:07:30.495321" and viewed the order details.
4) The user completed the session by logging out at "2025-09-13T14:07:56.530281" with a "200" status code response confirming the logout action.

The sequence of events demonstrates that the user completed a login (conversion) and then performed a series of actions that confirmed their engagement with the application, ultimately leading to a logout.
