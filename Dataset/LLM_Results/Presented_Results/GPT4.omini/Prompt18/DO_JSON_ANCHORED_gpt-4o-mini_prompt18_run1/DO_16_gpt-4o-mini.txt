==================================================

Tag: conversion [User logged in successfully and subsequently logged out, indicating a completed session.]

1) User initiated a login request via a POST request to `/api/login`, which returned a status code of 200, confirming a successful login.
2) User retrieved orders with a GET request to `/api/orders/`, which also returned a status code of 200, indicating that the user was actively engaged and retrieving information.
3) User then logged out via a POST request to `/api/logout`, which returned a status code of 200, indicating that the session was successfully terminated. 

This sequence of events indicates a successful conversion as the user logged in, interacted with the application (retrieving orders), and then logged out properly.
