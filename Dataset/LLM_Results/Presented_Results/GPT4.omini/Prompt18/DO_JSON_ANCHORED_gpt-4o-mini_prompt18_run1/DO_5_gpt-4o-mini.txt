==================================================

Tag: drop-off [The user did not complete the login process as no successful login event was recorded; all inputs were incomplete, particularly the password field which remains empty.]

1) The user entered a username ("hi") but did not enter a password (length 0).
2) The user clicked the "Sign In" button without providing a password, which is required for a successful login.
3) The session contains multiple input changes, but none indicate a completion of the login process (i.e., no successful login event was logged).
