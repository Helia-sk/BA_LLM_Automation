==================================================

Tag: Drop-off [The session did not result in a conversion action such as a purchase or form submission, but rather consisted of browsing and interaction events without a clear final goal.]

1) User accessed the menu page (`/restaurant/dashboard/menu`) and performed a click event.
2) The user scrolled down the page, indicating continued engagement but not a conversion.
3) Further clicks were made on menu items or navigation elements, but no final conversion action (like checkout or order placement) was recorded.
