Tag: conversion [The session includes a successful login attempt and interaction with the cart and orders, indicating engagement and potential purchasing behavior.]

1) The user initiated the session by clicking on the "Customer Login" link.
2) The user proceeded to enter their username and password, which indicates an intention to log in.
3) The login form was submitted successfully, as evidenced by the subsequent logs showing responses to login requests.
4) After logging in, the user interacted with the dashboard, specifically accessing both the "Orders" and "Cart" sections.
5) The logs show multiple interactions with the cart, including adding items, which further indicates that the user is engaged in a conversion-focused activity.

This sequence demonstrates that the session was not a drop-off but rather a conversion, as the user completed the login process and engaged with key functionalities aimed at completing a transaction.
