==================================================

Tag: conversion [The session included successful form submissions and interactions indicating a completed process.]

1) User clicked on the input fields and buttons on the menu page, indicating engagement with the interface.
2) The user submitted the form with relevant data (e.g., text input "very healthy" and number input "0.08").
3) The session logs include multiple successful input changes and clicks, suggesting that the user was actively filling out a form or interacting with the menu.
4) The final event logged indicates a form submission, which is a clear indication of conversion rather than drop-off.
