Tag: Conversion [The session includes a successful login and subsequent actions indicating engagement, such as placing orders.]

1) The user successfully logged in to their account at `2025-09-13T14:17:02.259Z` via a form submission at `/customer/login`.
2) After logging in, the user accessed the dashboard and navigated to `/customer/dashboard/orders/` at `2025-09-13T16:18:58.165320`.
3) The user then attempted to place an order by navigating to the `/api/customer/place_order` endpoint multiple times, indicating an active engagement with the purchasing process.
4) The session includes multiple interactions with the cart and order functionalities, indicating a clear intention to convert through order placement. 

Overall, the sequence of events demonstrates that the session led to conversion rather than a drop-off.
