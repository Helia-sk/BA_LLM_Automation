==================================================

Tag: conversion [The session resulted in a series of successful interactions leading to the completion of an order.]

1) The user initiated a request to view order details (`/api/orders/21/details`).
2) The user completed the order by sending a request to the endpoint (`/api/orders/21/complete`), which was successfully processed as indicated by the corresponding response logs.
3) The series of frontend click events also indicate user engagement with the dashboard, culminating in actions that suggest the user was navigating through the process effectively, rather than leaving the session. 

This sequence of events suggests that the user completed their intended actions without dropping off.
