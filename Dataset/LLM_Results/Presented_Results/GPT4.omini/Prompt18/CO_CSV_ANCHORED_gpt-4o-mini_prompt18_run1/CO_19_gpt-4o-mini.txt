Tag: Conversion [The session successfully completed actions that indicate user engagement and intent to purchase, such as logging in and submitting forms.]

1) User navigated to the login page.
2) User entered credentials (username and password) and submitted the login form.
3) User performed actions on the dashboard, including adding items and potentially logging out, indicating engagement with the session.
4) User submitted a form on the customer login page, which is a critical step for conversion.

Overall, the session shows multiple interactions that suggest the user completed key actions leading to a conversion rather than dropping off.
