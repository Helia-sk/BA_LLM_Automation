Tag: Conversion [The session included a successful login and subsequent actions indicating engagement with the platform.]

1) User clicked on the "Customer Login" button.
2) User entered the username and password.
3) User submitted the login form, which appears to have been successful.
4) User interacted with the dashboard and placed an order as indicated by subsequent API calls to "/api/customer/orders/" and "/api/customer/place_order".
