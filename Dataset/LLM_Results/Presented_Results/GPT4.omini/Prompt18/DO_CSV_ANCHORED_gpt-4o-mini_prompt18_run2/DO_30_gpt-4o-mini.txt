==================================================

Tag: Drop-off [User logged out without completing any conversion actions].  
1) The user initiated a logout process at 17:35:13, indicating the end of the session.  
2) Prior to logging out, the user interacted with the menu, clicking various buttons (like "Add Item") and changing input fields.  
3) However, there are no recorded conversion actions (e.g., completing an order or confirming a transaction), leading to the conclusion that the user did not convert during this session.  
4) The user interaction consisted primarily of navigation and input changes without significant progress towards a goal (e.g., placing an order).
