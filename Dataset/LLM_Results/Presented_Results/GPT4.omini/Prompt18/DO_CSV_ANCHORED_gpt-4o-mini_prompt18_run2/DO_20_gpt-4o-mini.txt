==================================================

Tag: conversion [The session includes successful login and interaction with subsequent pages]. 
1) User navigates to the login page and submits the login form. 
2) Successful login is indicated by responses from the backend for the login API. 
3) User interacts with menu and orders APIs, indicating engagement post-login. 
4) The sequence of events suggests that the user completed the login process and proceeded to use the application, thus indicating a conversion rather than a drop-off.
