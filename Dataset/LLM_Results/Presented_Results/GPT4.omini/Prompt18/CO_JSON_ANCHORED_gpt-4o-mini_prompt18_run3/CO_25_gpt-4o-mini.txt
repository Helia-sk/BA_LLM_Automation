==================================================

Tag: conversion [The session includes successful API requests that indicate actions taken by the user.]

1) User accessed the menu items using a GET request, receiving a 200 response (successful retrieval).
2) User initiated a DELETE request to remove a specific menu item, which also received a 200 response (successful deletion).
3) User performed multiple interactions with the menu (clicks and scrolls) while on the dashboard, suggesting engagement with the content. 

Overall, the actions taken in the session indicate that the user completed actions that align with conversion goals (like updating or deleting menu items), rather than dropping off without engagement.
