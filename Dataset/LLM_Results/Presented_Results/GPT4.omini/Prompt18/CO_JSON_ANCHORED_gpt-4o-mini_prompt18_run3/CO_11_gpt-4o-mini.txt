==================================================

Tag: conversion [The session included successful order placement and retrieval of customer orders.]

1) The session initiated with an HTTP GET request to retrieve customer orders, which received a 200 OK response.
2) The user made a successful POST request to place an order, which returned a 201 Created status, indicating that the order was successfully placed.
3) The user then made another GET request to retrieve their order history, which also received a 200 OK response.

The sequence of events indicates that the session resulted in a conversion, as it involved placing an order and confirming it through order retrieval.
