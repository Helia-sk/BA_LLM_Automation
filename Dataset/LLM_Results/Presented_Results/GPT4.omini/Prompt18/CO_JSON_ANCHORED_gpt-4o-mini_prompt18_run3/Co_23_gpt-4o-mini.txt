==================================================

Tag: conversion [The session includes multiple successful form submissions and HTTP responses with status codes indicating successful updates.]

1) User interacted with the settings page and submitted changes, triggering a `form_submit` event.
2) The form submission was processed and resulted in an HTTP response with a 200 status code, indicating a successful operation for updating opening hours.
3) Subsequent actions included additional successful HTTP responses for delivery areas and opening hours, confirming that the user completed their intended actions without dropping off.
4) The session includes multiple successful interactions and confirms the conversion rather than a drop-off.
