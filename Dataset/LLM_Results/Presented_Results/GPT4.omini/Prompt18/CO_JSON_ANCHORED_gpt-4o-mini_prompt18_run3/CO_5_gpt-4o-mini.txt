==================================================

Tag: Conversion [User successfully logged in and placed an order.]

1) User initiated login with valid credentials (POST to /api/customer/login, status code 200).
2) User accessed customer orders (GET to /api/customer/orders/, status code 200).
3) User placed an order (POST to /api/customer/place_order, status code 201).
4) User logged out (POST to /api/logout, status code 200). 

The presence of successful login and order placement indicates that this session resulted in a conversion rather than a drop-off.
