==================================================

Tag: conversion [User logged in successfully and then logged out.]

1) The session began with multiple clicks, including a click on "Customer Login" at "2025-09-13T11:47:37.959Z".
2) The user entered the username "User1" and password fields, indicating an attempt to log in, with relevant input changes logged.
3) The user successfully submitted the login form, as evidenced by the POST request to "/api/customer/login" at "2025-09-13T13:47:43.143Z", receiving a 200 status code in the response.
4) After logging in, the user navigated through their dashboard, eventually clicking the "Logout" button, which was logged as a successful logout on "2025-09-13T13:48:03.120638".

This session reflects a complete conversion process from login to logout, indicating successful engagement rather than a drop-off.
