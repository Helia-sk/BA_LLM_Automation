==================================================

Tag: drop-off [The session did not complete a successful conversion as there were no successful login attempts indicated by the absence of a valid password input and submission.]

1) User attempted to input a password, but the final value length is 0 (indicating no password was entered).
2) User clicked the "Sign In" button, but without entering a valid username and password, this action does not lead to a conversion.
3) User inputted a username ("hi") but did not provide a password, which is necessary for login.
4) The session does not indicate any successful login or transition to a subsequent page or action that signifies a conversion.
