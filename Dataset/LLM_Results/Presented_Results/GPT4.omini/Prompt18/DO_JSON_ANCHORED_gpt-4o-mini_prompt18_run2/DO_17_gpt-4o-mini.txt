==================================================

Tag: Conversion [The session includes a successful login and subsequent actions indicating engagement with the application.]

1) User initiated a login action at "2025-09-13T12:19:07.829Z" with a valid username and password input.
2) Successful login response received at "2025-09-13T14:19:08.433436" with a status code of 200.
3) User accessed order information via a GET request to "/api/orders/" at "2025-09-13T14:19:08.829504", receiving a successful response (200).
4) User logged out successfully via a POST request to "/api/logout" at "2025-09-13T14:19:19.205480", also receiving a 200 status code. 

The sequence of events indicates active engagement leading to a successful login and subsequent interactions, culminating in a logout, thus classifying the session as a conversion rather than a drop-off.
