2) Selected various inputs in the settings form.
3) Clicked "Submit Changes" button.
4) Successfully received responses from the server for multiple API requests related to orders and settings.

The sequence of events shows that the user interacted with the settings, made changes, and submitted them, which indicates a successful conversion rather than a drop-off.
