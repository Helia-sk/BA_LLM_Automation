==================================================

Tag: drop-off [The session did not result in a successful login, as the user did not provide a valid username or password before stopping interactions.]

1) User clicked on "Restaurant PartnersRegister your restaurant or log in to manage orders" at 12:15:32.750Z, navigating to the login page.
2) User clicked on the username input field, presumably to enter their username, at 12:15:34.477Z.
3) User entered a username ("d") at 12:15:35.119Z but did not complete the username field or enter a password.
4) User clicked on the "Sign In" button at 12:15:39.156Z, but there is no record of a successful login attempt, as the password field remained empty and username input was incomplete.
5) User interacted with the password field at 12:15:41.998Z, but the input value is hidden, and it appears the password was not submitted correctly, leaving the session without conversion.
