==================================================

Tag: Conversion [User successfully logged in and interacted with menu and orders.]

1) User initiated a login request at "2025-09-13T12:27:30.389Z", indicated by the "form_submit" event with username and password fields filled.
2) The system responded with a success status (200) to the login request at "2025-09-13T14:27:31.305874", confirming the user was logged in.
3) Following the login, the user accessed the menu items via a GET request to "/api/menu/" at "2025-09-13T14:27:34.576022" and received a successful response.
4) The user made another GET request to "/api/orders/" at "2025-09-13T14:27:31.960035", which also returned a successful response, indicating further interaction after logging in. 

Overall, the sequence shows successful login and subsequent engagement with application features, marking it as a conversion rather than a drop-off.
