==================================================

Tag: conversion [The session included a successful login and subsequent actions indicating user engagement]. 

1) User clicks on "Customer Login" button.
2) User inputs username and password, triggering input change events.
3) User submits login form, which results in a successful login (status code 200).
4) User retrieves customer orders (status code 200).
5) User logs out successfully (status code 200). 

The series of actions taken by the user, culminating in a successful login followed by accessing orders, indicates that the session was a conversion rather than a drop-off.
