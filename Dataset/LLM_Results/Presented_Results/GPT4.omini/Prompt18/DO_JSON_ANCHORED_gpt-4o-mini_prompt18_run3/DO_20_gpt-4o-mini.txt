==================================================

Tag: conversion [User successfully logged in and accessed menu and orders API endpoints.]

1) The user initiated a login attempt by clicking on the "Sign In" button at "2025-09-13T12:25:45.186Z".
2) The user submitted the login form, which had fields for username and password, and passed validation at "2025-09-13T12:25:45.187Z".
3) The server responded positively to the login attempt with a 200 status code at "2025-09-13T14:25:46.054102".
4) After logging in, the user accessed the menu items API, receiving a 200 status response at "2025-09-13T14:25:49.533892".
5) The user then accessed the orders API, which also returned a 200 status response at "2025-09-13T14:25:46.702172".

Overall, these steps indicate that the user completed a successful login and accessed key features of the application, signaling a conversion rather than a drop-off.
