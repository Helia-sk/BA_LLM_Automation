==================================================

1) Determine the final action taken in the session by checking the last event's URL path. In this case, the last event URL is "/restaurant/dashboard/history".

2) Check if there was any subsequent interaction (events) after the last event. Since there are no more events after the last one, it suggests that the user did not take any further action.

3) Based on the absence of any additional interactions and the fact that the last URL is related to the history section, it appears that the user navigated to the "History" page but did not perform a conversion (e.g., placing an order, filling out a form).

4) Since there was no final conversion event in this session, it can be classified as a drop-off session.

Tag: Drop-off [The user navigated to the History section but did not take any further action or convert].
