 Tag: Drop-off
   1) The user clicked on the "Restaurant Login" link, indicating they navigated to the login page.
   2) No further interaction related to form submission or account creation was recorded in the log file after this point.
   3) The absence of any subsequent actions that would typically be associated with a successful login or conversion event suggests that the session ended without completion. Therefore, we can consider this a drop-off session.
