==================================================

 Tag: Drop-off

   Reason: The user visited the website, clicked on the "Hungry? Order delicious food from local restaurants" call-to-action (CTA), scrolled down to the login page, but there is no subsequent interaction or indication of a form fill or submission that would indicate a successful login. The last recorded event was a scroll event, suggesting the user may have continued browsing without logging in, implying a drop-off.

   1) The user initially visited the homepage ("/").

   2) Clicked on the CTA to navigate to the "/customer/login" page.

   3) Scrolled down on the login page but did not interact with the login form, suggesting a potential drop-off.
