 Tag: Session was a Conversion

   Reason: The session started with the user clicking on the "Orders" link from the dashboard, indicating an intent to interact with the orders section. Later in the session, the user clicked on the "Menu" link, suggesting they were exploring the available options within the application. Finally, the user performed an action that is typically associated with a conversion (i.e., clicking the "Save" button). This sequence of actions indicates that the user found what they were looking for and completed their intended goal, which is consistent with a conversion.

   1) The session started with a click on a link related to the main functionality of the application (Orders), indicating a clear intent to interact with the orders section.

   2) The user explored other sections of the application by clicking on additional links (Menu). This behavior is often seen in users who are familiarizing themselves with an application or exploring its features before making a decision.

   3) The user performed an action that is typically associated with a conversion (clicking the "Save" button), indicating they found what they were looking for and completed their intended goal within the application. This action, combined with the previous steps, suggests that this session was a conversion.
