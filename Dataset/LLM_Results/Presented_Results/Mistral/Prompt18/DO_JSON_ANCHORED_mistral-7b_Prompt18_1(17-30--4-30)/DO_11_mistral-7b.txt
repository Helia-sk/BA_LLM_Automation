   1) The user clicked on the "Customer Login" link, which indicates an attempt to start a session.
   2) After clicking the login link, there is no record of any further user interaction, such as entering a username or password, for the rest of the log file.
   3) Since the user did not perform any action that would lead towards completing the intended goal (logging in), it can be inferred that the session ended without conversion.
