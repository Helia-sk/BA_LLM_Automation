 Tag: Drop-off

   Reason: The user navigated to the "Menu" page but didn't perform any action that could be considered a conversion, such as adding an item or completing an order. Furthermore, the session ended without any further interaction after clicking the "Menu" link.

   1) The session started on the "/restaurant/dashboard" page.

   2) The user clicked the "Accept" button on the dashboard, indicating they accepted the terms or conditions.

   3) Next, the user navigated to the "Menu" page by clicking the "Menu" link.

   4) On the "Menu" page, the user did not interact with any of the buttons or items, which could suggest a lack of interest or intent to purchase.

   5) The session ended without any further interaction after clicking the "Menu" link, suggesting that the user may have left the site or moved on to another task.

   Tag: Session Duration

   Reason: While the session lasted over 10 minutes, the lack of interaction and conversion indicates a drop-off rather than a prolonged browsing session.

   1) The session started at approximately 15:34:56.

   2) The user's first action was to click the "Accept" button on the dashboard at 15:34:56, indicating the start of the active portion of the session.

   3) The user navigated to the "Menu" page at 15:35:02, marking a significant gap in activity since clicking the "Accept" button.

   4) No further interaction or conversion was recorded after this point until the end of the session, which was approximately 15:35:04.133. This suggests that the user left the site or moved on to another task during the intervening period.

   Tag: Pages Visited

   Reason: The user visited only two pages during the session, with no interaction or conversion recorded on either page.

   1) The user started on the "/restaurant/dashboard" page.

   2) Next, the user navigated to the "Menu" page by clicking the "Menu" link. No further interaction was recorded on this page.

   Tag: User Interaction

   Reason: The user did not interact with any elements that could be considered a conversion, such as adding an item or completing an order, on either of the two pages visited during the session.

   1) On the "/restaurant/dashboard" page, the user clicked the "Accept" button at 15:34:56.

   2) On the "Menu" page, no interaction was recorded after clicking the "Menu" link at 15:35:02.
