 Tag: Session is a Conversion

   1) The user clicked on the "Customer Login" link, indicating that they have navigated to the login page.

   2) The user then interacted with the username input field by clicking on it twice (steps 4 and 5), suggesting that they intended to enter their username for login.

   3) After typing something in the username field (step 7 and 8), the user performed the same action again, demonstrating further engagement with the page.

   4) The user then clicked on the username input field once more (step 10), possibly to confirm or verify their entered credentials before attempting to log in.

   5) Finally, the user successfully logged in, as evidenced by the fact that they interacted with the password input field (step 12 and 13). This indicates that the session resulted in a successful login, thus it can be considered a conversion.
