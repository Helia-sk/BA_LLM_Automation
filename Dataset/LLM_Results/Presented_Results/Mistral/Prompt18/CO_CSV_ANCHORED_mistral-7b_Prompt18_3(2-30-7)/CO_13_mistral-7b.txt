==================================================

1) Identify the events in the frontend logs that correspond to user interactions related to an order details page and history page.
    - log_1757835961979_hw4mtgead: Click on "View Details" button, indicating a user interaction with an order details page.
    - log_1757835951066_9edj3bwaz: Click on the "History" link, indicating a navigation to the history page.

2) Analyze the back-end logs for any request related to completing an order or getting order details. This will help us determine if the user has interacted with the order in a way that indicates they are finished with it (conversion) or not (drop-off).
    - We see multiple requests to /api/orders/21, including http_request and http_response for completing an order (log_ids: 8205e1fd, 97a92447, 048cfe59, afc43196). This indicates that the user has interacted with the order in a way that suggests they have finished with it.
    - There are also requests to /api/orders/21/details (log_ids: bcbbf582, 0380ea5e), but no corresponding completion request, which means the user did not finish the process for this order.

3) Based on our analysis of both the front-end and back-end logs, we can conclude that the session is a conversion for order #21 [because the user interacted with the order in a way that suggests they have finished with it (completed the order)].
    - The user first navigated to the history page (log_1757835951066_9edj3bwaz), then clicked on an order detail link, and finally interacted with the order by completing it (multiple requests to /api/orders/21, including log_ids: 8205e1fd, 97a92447, 048cfe59, afc43196).

The session is a conversion for order #21 because the user interacted with the order in a way that suggests they have finished with it (completed the order).
