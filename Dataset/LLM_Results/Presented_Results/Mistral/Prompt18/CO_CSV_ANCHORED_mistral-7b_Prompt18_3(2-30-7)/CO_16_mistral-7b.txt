==================================================

1) Identify the sequence of user interactions in the log file.
    - The user clicked on the "Customer Login" button, indicating they initiated a login attempt. (log_1758982438247)
    - The user then clicked on the username input field. (log_1758982439208, log_1758982438247)
    - The user typed in a username value and clicked away from the username input field, indicating they finished typing their username. (log_1758982441921)
    - The user typed in a password value and clicked away from the password input field, indicating they finished typing their password. (log_1758982441938)
    - No further user interactions were recorded after the login attempt, suggesting the session might have been a drop-off.

2) Determine if additional data is needed to confirm the decision.
    - In this case, there is no additional data provided to definitively determine whether the session was a conversion or a drop-off. However, since no further user interactions were recorded after the login attempt, it's reasonable to assume that the session might have been a drop-off.

3) Make a decision and provide reasoning.
    - Tag: Potential Drop-Off
      Reason: The user initiated a login attempt by clicking the "Customer Login" button but no further interactions were recorded after the login attempt, suggesting that they may not have completed the process successfully or chose to leave the site without completing their action.
