==================================================

1) Identify the user interaction events in the log file.
    - The user navigates to the customer login page (`/customer/login`) with an anonymous session ID (`session_1757771443548_7eqjj0e9b`).
    - The user clicks on the "Username" input field.
    - The user clicks inside the "Username" input field.
    - The user types a character 'd' in the "Username" input field, which triggers a debounced input event and then a regular input change event.
    - The user clicks on the "Username" input field again.
    - No further user interactions are observed, suggesting the user might have left the page without completing any actions (i.e., logging in).

2) Determine if the session was a drop-off or a conversion.
- Since no login action was performed after the user typed 'd' in the "Username" input field and the session does not contain any other interaction events, it appears to be a drop-off session.

Tag: Drop-off [The user did not complete the login process]
