==================================================

1) First, we identify the sequence of user interactions by looking at the timestamps and events. The log shows that the user clicked on "Customer Login" (log_1758982282529_ew7a529gr), then navigated to the customer login page (log_1758982282530_ew7a529gr).
  2) Next, we look for any form input events that could indicate a successful login attempt. In this case, there are multiple `input_change` events for the "username" field (log_1758982299417_vimywuxpt, log_1758982300242_lmwx4qaau, log_1758982302837_uugm0ut74, log_1758982304493_w6qfzr97p). However, there's no corresponding `input_change` event for the "password" field.
  3) Since we don't see a password input event followed by a successful login (e.g., a `page_view` or other indication of a successful login), it appears that this session was a drop-off, as the user did not complete the login process.

Tag: Drop-off [The user clicked on "Customer Login" and entered something into the username field but didn't enter a password or perform any other action that would indicate a successful login.]
