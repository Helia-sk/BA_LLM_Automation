 Tag: Drop-off

   Reason: The user did not interact with any elements on the page that would indicate a conversion, such as clicking a button or submitting a form. Additionally, the user scrolled to the bottom of the page (indicated by the scroll events) but did not return to the top, which suggests they may have left the site without taking a desired action.

   Step 1: The session started on "/customer/dashboard", indicating this is a new session.

   Step 2: The user scrolled through the page multiple times (scroll events), but there were no click events or interactions with conversion-focused elements.

   Step 3: The user eventually scrolled to the bottom of the page and did not return, suggesting they may have left the site without taking any action.
