1) [Step 1] The user clicked on the "Customer Login" button, indicating that the user has intentionally navigated to the login page.

2) [Step 2] The user entered a username ("User1") and then clicked away from the username input field, suggesting that the user may have intended to type a password next. However, no further actions related to password entry were recorded in this log file.

3) [Step 3] Since no other actions related to password entry or submission were observed, it appears that the user did not complete the login process and likely dropped off at this point.
