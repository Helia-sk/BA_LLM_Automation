 Tag: Drop-off

  1) The user initially accessed the "Balance" page (indicating potential interest in managing their account balance), but then navigated to multiple other pages, including "Orders", "Cart", and "Checkout". This suggests exploration rather than a focused action.

  2) The user did not complete any transactions or make a purchase during the session, as indicated by the lack of "purchase" events in the log file.

  3) The user also clicked on the "View Details" and "X" buttons on the orders page, but did not proceed to actually view the details or take any further action related to those orders. This is another indication of exploration rather than intent to complete a transaction.

  4) The user ultimately left the site by closing the browser (indicated by no further events after the timestamp 2025-09-13T14:42:32.191Z).

Based on these observations, it appears that this session was a drop-off as the user did not take any action leading to a conversion (completing a transaction or making a purchase). However, the user's exploration of multiple pages suggests potential interest in the site and future engagement.
