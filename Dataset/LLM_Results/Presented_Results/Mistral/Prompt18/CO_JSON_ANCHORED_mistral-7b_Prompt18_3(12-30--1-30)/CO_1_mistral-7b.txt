 Tag: Conversion

  1) The user first clicked on the "Customer Login" link (indicating intent to access the customer login page).

  2) The user then clicked on the username input field, indicating that they are preparing to enter their credentials.

  3) The user entered their username ("User1") into the username input field. This suggests that the user has an account and is attempting to log in.

  4) The user then clicked on the password input field, again suggesting intent to provide their credentials and complete the login process.

  5) Although we do not see a final entry showing the user providing their password, it is reasonable to assume that if they had entered their password correctly, the system would have authenticated them and taken them to a subsequent page (such as their account dashboard), which is not shown in this log. The fact that no such subsequent page is shown does not necessarily mean the login failed, as the log may only show events up until the point where the user was successfully authenticated but did not interact with any subsequent pages during the session.

  6) In the absence of evidence to the contrary, it is reasonable to conclude that the user successfully logged in and had a conversion. The fact that we do not see subsequent interactions does not necessarily mean they left the site immediately after logging in; they may have simply navigated away from the page without interacting with it any further.
