 Tag: Drop-Off

   Reason: The session started with a form submission, but there was no subsequent form_submit event indicating that the user successfully logged in or navigated to another page. Instead, there were several click events and an input change event, suggesting that the user interacted with the sign-in page but did not complete the process.

   1) The session started with a form submission (log_1758985849134_5na5ry90h), indicating the user attempted to sign in.

   2) After the form submission, there was no form_submit event, suggesting that the user did not successfully log in or navigate to another page (no log entry for form_submit).

   3) Instead, there were several click events (log entries from log_1758985849132_sm9gb6j5r, log_1758985849032_pt9psc4kp), indicating the user clicked on elements on the sign-in page but did not navigate to another page.

   4) The absence of a subsequent URL change or interaction with other pages supports the idea that this was a drop-off and not a conversion.
