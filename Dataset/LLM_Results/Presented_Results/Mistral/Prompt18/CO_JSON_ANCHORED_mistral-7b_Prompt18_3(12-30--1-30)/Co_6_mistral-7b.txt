==================================================

 Tag: Drop-off
   1) The user clicked on the "Customer Login" link, indicating they navigated to the login page.
   2) After clicking the username input field, it suggests the user was attempting to enter their credentials, but no further actions were recorded that would indicate a successful login or submission of the form.
   3) Since there is no subsequent activity that indicates a successful conversion (e.g., navigation to another page or completion of an action), and considering the user's session ended after these initial interactions, it appears this session was a drop-off.
