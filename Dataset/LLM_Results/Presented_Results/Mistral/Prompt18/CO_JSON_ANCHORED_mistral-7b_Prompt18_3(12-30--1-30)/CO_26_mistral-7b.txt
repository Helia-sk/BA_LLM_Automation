 Tag: Drop-off

   1) The user visited the menu page and navigated through various items (Starters, Main Courses, Desserts, Drinks, Side Dishes). This indicates interest in the products.

   2) The user clicked on the "Add Item" button, which typically leads to a product selection or input form. However, no further interactions related to product selection were recorded.

   3) The user interacted with the upload image area but did not actually upload an image, which could have been a crucial step in adding an item to the menu.

   4) The last interaction was clicking on an SVG element without any apparent functionality related to the conversion process, suggesting that the user might have gotten stuck or lost interest at this point.

Since no product selection or input form submission was recorded after the "Add Item" click event, it appears that the session was a drop-off, as the user did not complete the intended action (adding an item to the menu).
