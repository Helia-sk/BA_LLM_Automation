 Tag: Conversion

  1) The user started on the dashboard (/customer/dashboard) and navigated to the Restaurants page, indicating an initial exploration.

  2) After exploring the Restaurants page, the user clicked on a specific restaurant ("Restaurant 9") from the list, showing interest in that particular establishment.

  3) Following the click on the restaurant, the user performed another action by clicking the "View Menu" button, which is typically associated with further engagement or intent to make a purchase.

  4) Lastly, the user clicked the "Add to Cart" button for an item from the menu, demonstrating clear intention and commitment to complete a transaction.

  5) The session ended after the "Add to Cart" action, but given that adding items to cart is a typical step in an e-commerce conversion funnel, it is reasonable to conclude that this session represents a successful conversion.
