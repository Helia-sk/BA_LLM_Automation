 Tag: Drop-Off

   Reason: The user clicked on the "Already have an account? Sign in" button, indicating that they might be leaving the page to sign in instead of completing the registration process. This is a common action that often leads to a drop-off because users are redirected away from the current page.

   [Step 1] The user navigated to the Restaurant Login page (indicated by the "Restaurant Login" link click event).

   [Step 2] The user clicked on the input field for username, but no subsequent interaction with the form was observed, suggesting that they might have decided not to fill out the form.

   [Step 3] The user clicked on the "Already have an account? Sign in" button, which is a common drop-off point as users are redirected away from the current page.

   [Step 4] No subsequent interactions were observed after the "Sign In" click event, further confirming that the session was likely a drop-off.
