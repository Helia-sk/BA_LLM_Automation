 Tag: Session is a Conversion
   1) The user navigated to the "/customer/login" page (indicating intent to log in), clicked the "Customer Login" button, and then interacted with the username input field. This sequence of actions suggests that the user intends to complete the login process.
   2) After clicking the username input field, the user began typing characters into the field, indicating continued engagement with the page.
   3) The fact that the user's session ID remains consistent throughout the log indicates that the user has not closed the browser or navigated away from the site, further suggesting that they are still actively engaged in the login process.
   Additionally, the last entry in the log shows the user on the homepage (/"/"), which could be a result of successful login and navigation to the next page. The sequence of events and the consistent session ID suggest that this session was a conversion, as the user successfully logged in and navigated to another page on the site.
