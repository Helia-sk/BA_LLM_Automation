==================================================

 Tag: Drop-off

   Reason: The user navigated to the login page, entered a username, clicked on the username field, and then did not enter any password. After that, there is no record of any further interaction or submission indicating a successful login. Since there was no conversion event recorded (such as placing an order), it seems likely that this session represents a drop-off.

   Steps:
   1) The user navigated to the Restaurant Partners page and clicked on the "Register your restaurant or log in to manage orders" link, indicating interest in further interaction with the site.
   2) Upon reaching the login page, the user entered a username (User1).
   3) The user then clicked on both the username and password fields without entering any password information.
   4) There is no subsequent record of the user performing any actions that would indicate a successful login or further interaction with the site, suggesting that this session may have been abandoned or ended unsuccessfully.
