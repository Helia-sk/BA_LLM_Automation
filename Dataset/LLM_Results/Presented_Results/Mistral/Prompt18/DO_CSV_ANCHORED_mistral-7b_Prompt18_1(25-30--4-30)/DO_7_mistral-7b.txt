 Tag: Drop-off

1) The user navigated to the website (indicated by the click event on "/" at 2025-09-13T11:47:20.135Z), but there is no subsequent interaction with any element that would indicate a selection of "Customer Login".

2) The user did not interact with the username input field or click on it, which is an expected action before entering a username for login.

3) There are no further events suggesting navigation to another page or engagement with the website, indicating that the session ended without a conversion event taking place.

4) The user's interaction with the website is limited to clicking on the Lieferspatz logo (2025-09-13T11:47:20.135Z), which does not lead directly to a login page or any other conversion-inducing action, further supporting the conclusion that this was a drop-off session.
