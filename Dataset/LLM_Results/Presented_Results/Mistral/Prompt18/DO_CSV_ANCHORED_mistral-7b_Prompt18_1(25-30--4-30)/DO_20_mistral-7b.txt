1) The user clicked on the "Restaurant Login" button, indicating that they are attempting to start a session.

2) The user then entered their username and navigated to the username input field, but there is no record of them entering a password or submitting the login form, suggesting that they have not completed the login process yet.

3) Since there is no subsequent action showing that the user successfully logged in or performed any other actions on the site, this session can be classified as a drop-off as the user did not complete the intended action (logging in).
