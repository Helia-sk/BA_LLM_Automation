1) The user navigated to the Restaurant Login page.
2) The user entered a username ("User1").
3) The user did not enter a password, which is required for login in most cases.
4) No subsequent actions indicating a successful login were recorded.
5) The session ended without any further interactions related to login, which suggests a drop-off rather than a conversion.
