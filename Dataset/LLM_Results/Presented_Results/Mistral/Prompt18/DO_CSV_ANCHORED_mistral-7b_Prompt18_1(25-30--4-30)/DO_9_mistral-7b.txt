 Tag: Drop-off

1) The user has interacted with the login page, filled in their username (User1), but did not proceed to fill in their password. This indicates that they may have decided not to continue the login process.
2) There is no further interaction from the user after filling in their username, which suggests that they did not initiate any other actions on the site.
3) The absence of a password entry and subsequent actions indicates that the session has ended without a conversion (completing the login or performing another intended action).
