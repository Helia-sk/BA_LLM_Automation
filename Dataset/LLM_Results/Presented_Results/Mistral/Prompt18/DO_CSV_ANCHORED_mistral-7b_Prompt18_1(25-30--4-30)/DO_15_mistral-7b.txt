==================================================

1) [Identifying User Interaction] Identify the sequence of user interactions by analyzing the 'event_name' field in each log.
  2) [Tracking Session] Track the session ID ('session_id') to follow the same session throughout the given logs.
  3) [Determining Conversion or Drop-off] A conversion is typically defined as a user completing a desired action, such as signing up or making a purchase. In this case, we don't have clear evidence of a conversion since there are no "submit" events for form interactions that might indicate the completion of registration or login.
  4) [Analyzing User Flow] Follow the user flow by examining the 'route' field in each log. The user initially navigated to '/' and then moved to '/restaurant/login'. There is no subsequent change in route, indicating the user remained on the login page throughout the observed logs.
  5) [Making a Decision] Based on the lack of clear evidence for a conversion and continuous navigation to the same page ('route'), this session appears to be a drop-off.

Tag: Drop-off [User did not complete any desired action (registration or login), remained on the login page throughout the observed logs.]
