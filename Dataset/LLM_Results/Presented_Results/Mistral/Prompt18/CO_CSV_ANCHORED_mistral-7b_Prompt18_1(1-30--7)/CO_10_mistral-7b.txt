==================================================

1) Identify the user's interactions within the session from the log file.

* The user initially lands on the dashboard page (/customer/dashboard), indicating the start of a new session.
* The user clicks on "Orders" which takes them to the orders page.
* The user clicks on an order, viewing its details.
* The user clicks on "View Details" of another order.
* The user clicks on "Balance" which takes them to the balance page.
* The user clicks on "X" to close an order detail, indicating they are done viewing it.
* The user clicks on "X" to close another order detail.
* The user clicks on "Orders" again to go back to the orders page.
* The user doesn't perform any further actions within the session or interact with the website, suggesting the session has ended.

2) Determine if this session was a drop-off or a conversion.

* Since the user didn't make a purchase or complete any other goal during their session, it appears to be a drop-off. They were actively engaging and exploring their order details, but no transaction occurred.

Tag: Drop-off [The user did not complete a transaction or reach a desired goal within the session.]
