==================================================

1) [Step 1] Identify the sequence of user interactions in the log file, starting from the first click on the "Restaurant Login" link and ending with the last interaction.

2) [Step 2] Determine if the user entered a value for both the username and password fields. In this case, the username field was filled ("User1") but there is no corresponding interaction for the password field.

3) [Step 3] Based on the absence of a password input, we can conclude that the session did not result in a conversion as the user did not complete the login process by submitting both the username and password.

4) [Step 4] Since the session did not lead to a conversion (login), it was a drop-off.

Tag: Drop-off
[Reason]: The user initiated a login but did not provide a password, indicating an incomplete action.
