 Tag: Conversion

  1) The user clicked on the "Settings" link, indicating an intent to navigate to a specific page.

  2) The user then interacted with multiple elements on the "Settings" page, such as clicks on various UI components like buttons and dropdowns, which suggests that the user was exploring the settings options.

  3) Finally, since no "click" event indicating navigation away from the "Settings" page was recorded, it can be inferred that the user did not leave the application or navigate to another page, implying a successful completion of the intended action on the Settings page. This sequence of actions and lack of drop-off signifies a conversion.
