 Tag: Session is a Conversion

   Reason: The user interacted with the login form (username input and password input), clicked on the submit button, and then proceeded to click on links within the application, indicating continued engagement. Finally, the user clicked on "Restaurant Partners", which could be an indication of completing the registration process or navigating to a different section of the application. The lack of a log entry for a logout event also supports this conclusion as it suggests that the user did not leave the application.
