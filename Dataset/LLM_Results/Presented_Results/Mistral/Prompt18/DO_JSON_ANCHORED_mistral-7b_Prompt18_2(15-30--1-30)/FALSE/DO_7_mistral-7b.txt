==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   1) The user first clicked on the "Customer Login" button, which navigated to the login page (`/customer/login`).
   2) The user then clicked on the logo of the website ("Lieferspatz"), but this action did not change the URL or navigate anywhere (still on `/customer/login`).
   3) The user interacted with the username input field and password input field, but they didn't fill in any information.
   4) After that, the user clicked outside of the username input field, but still didn't provide any login credentials.
   5) The user didn't proceed to submit the form by clicking the "Submit" button or any other actions that would indicate a successful login.

Since the user didn't complete the login process and no further interaction was recorded in the log file, it appears this session was a drop-off.
