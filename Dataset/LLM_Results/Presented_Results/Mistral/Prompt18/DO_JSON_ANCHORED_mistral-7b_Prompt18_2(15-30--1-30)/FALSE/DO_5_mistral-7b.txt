 Tag: Drop-off

  1) The user initially landed on the homepage ("/") and scrolled down, but did not interact with any clickable elements.

  2) After scrolling, the user navigated to the "/customer/login" page, which indicates an attempt to engage more deeply with the site. However, there is no subsequent interaction or activity on this page.

  3) Subsequently, there are a series of events related to scrolling and focus on various elements within the login page, but still no user action that would indicate a successful login or further engagement with the site.

  4) The last event in the log file shows that the user scrolled back up to the homepage ("/") without interacting with any clickable elements, suggesting that they may have navigated away from the site.

In conclusion, since there is no evidence of a successful login or further engagement with the site after landing on the login page, it seems likely that this session was a drop-off due to user inaction and potential navigation away from the site.
