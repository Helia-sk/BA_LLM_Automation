==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   1) The user first clicks on the username input field (log at index 9), but does not immediately start typing or select a value, indicating potential hesitation.
   2) After that, the user clicks on an SVG element within the page (log at index 10), suggesting further exploration without any interaction with the username input field or other elements related to form submission.
   3) Subsequent actions do not involve typing into the username input field or interacting with any other form elements. The user does not submit any information, and there is no indication of a login attempt or account creation.
   4) Eventually, the user clicks on the username input field again (log at index 15), but still without providing any input or attempting to log in/create an account.
   5) The user's session ends with more non-interactive actions, such as clicking on other elements within the page (log at index 16). Since there is no evidence of a successful login, registration, or other desired action, this can be considered a drop-off.
