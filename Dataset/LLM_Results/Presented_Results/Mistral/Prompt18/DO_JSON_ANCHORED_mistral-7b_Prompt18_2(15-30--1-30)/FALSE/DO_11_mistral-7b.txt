==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   1) The user clicked on the "Customer Login" link, indicating they have navigated to the login page.
   2) The user then clicked on an input field for the username, but no subsequent interaction with that field was recorded, suggesting they may not have entered any information.
   3) No interaction was recorded after clicking the username input field, and no form submission was logged, which is typically a sign of a drop-off since the login process requires input from the user.
   4) No actions were taken on the page that are indicative of completing the login process or moving to another page, further supporting the conclusion of a drop-off.
