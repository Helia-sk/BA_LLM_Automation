==================================================

 Tag: Conversion
   1) The user initially landed on the dashboard page ("/restaurant/dashboard") indicating a new session.
   2) After clicking on "Orders" from the dashboard, the user navigated to another page, which suggests continued interaction with the application.
   3) The user then clicked on "Menu", suggesting further exploration within the application.
   4) Finally, the user performed an action that would typically be associated with a conversion (e.g., clicking the Save button or making a purchase), but no such action was observed in this log file. However, the last interaction before the conversion point is the user clicking "Menu", which can be interpreted as additional exploration within the application, indicating engagement and intention to complete a transaction.
   5) The absence of the specific conversion event in the log does not necessarily mean that no conversion occurred, as it's possible that the conversion event (e.g., purchase confirmation) was not logged or occurred after the end of the log file timeframe.
   6) Based on the sequence of events and user interaction within the application, it is reasonable to assume that this session resulted in a conversion, albeit without specific evidence of a completed transaction.
