 Tag: Drop-off

   Reason: The user did not add any items to the cart or perform any other actions that would indicate a purchase was made. They only navigated between pages and clicked buttons for navigation purposes.

   1) The user initially landed on the restaurant dashboard page (`/restaurant/dashboard`) and accepted an alert presented there. This is typically the first step in a conversion funnel, but it doesn't necessarily guarantee a conversion will occur.

   2) Next, the user navigated to the menu page (`/restaurant/dashboard/menu`) by clicking the "Menu" link.

   3) The user then navigated within the menu page and clicked various buttons, but none of these clicks resulted in adding an item to the cart or performing any other actions that would indicate a purchase was made.

   In conclusion, since no purchase-related actions were performed during this session, it can be considered as a drop-off rather than a conversion.
