==================================================

 Tag: Drop-off
   1) The user initially landed on the homepage ("/") and then navigated to the login page ("/customer/login"). This indicates that the user had an intention to interact with the site, but not necessarily to convert.
   2) After landing on the login page, the user scrolled down through the page, but no actions were taken related to filling out the form or clicking any buttons suggesting a login attempt.
   3) The user then clicked on a link reading "Hungry? Order delicious food from local restaurants", which may have been an unintentional click or simply a curiosity-driven action not related to logging in. This further indicates that the session was not focused on converting.
   4) After clicking the link, the user scrolled down the login page again, but no form fill or submit actions were taken.
   5) The user then scrolled back up the login page and left the site by scrolling back to the top of the homepage, confirming that the session was a drop-off as the user did not complete the intended action (logging in).
