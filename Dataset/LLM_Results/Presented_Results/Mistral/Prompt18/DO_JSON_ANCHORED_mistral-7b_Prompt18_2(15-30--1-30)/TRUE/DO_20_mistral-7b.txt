 Tag: Drop-off
   1) The user navigated to the Restaurant Login page (indicating an intent to log in or sign up).
   2) The user clicked on the username input field, suggesting they are preparing to enter their username.
   3) However, no further actions related to entering a username or password were recorded, indicating that the user did not proceed with logging in or signing up.
   4) Since no subsequent action (such as clicking "Submit" or navigating away from the login page) was recorded, it appears that this session was a drop-off, meaning the user left without completing their intended action on the website.
