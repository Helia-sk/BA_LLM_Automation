==================================================

 Tag: Drop-off

   Reason: The session shows the user navigating through various sections of the customer dashboard (Orders, Balance, and View Details), but there is no indication of any purchase or transaction in the log file provided. Additionally, the session ends with the user leaving the Orders page without interacting further, which suggests they may have left the site without completing a conversion.

   1) The user navigates to the customer dashboard (/customer/dashboard/) by clicking on either "Orders", "Balance", or "Dashboard" links from the previous page.

   2) The user clicks on the "Orders" link from the Dashboard and remains on that page without performing any actions related to a purchase or transaction.

   3) The user then clicks on the "View Details" button for an order, but there is no further interaction recorded in the log file after this step.

   Tag: Unable to determine conversion status with certainty

   Reason: The session does not contain enough information to definitively classify it as a conversion, as there are no actions indicative of a purchase or transaction in the provided log file. However, the user's navigation patterns suggest that they may have been exploring their account rather than actively making a purchase. Further analysis would require additional data, such as tracking pixels for completed transactions or user behavior on other pages.
