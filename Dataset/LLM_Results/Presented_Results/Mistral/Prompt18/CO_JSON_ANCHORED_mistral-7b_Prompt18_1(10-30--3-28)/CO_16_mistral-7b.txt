==================================================

 Tag: Session was a Conversion
   1) The user clicked on the "Customer Login" link (indicating intent to sign in), which navigates them to the login page.
   2) Upon reaching the login page, the user clicked the username input field, suggesting they intend to enter their username.
   3) After clicking the username input field, there is no subsequent activity in the log related to the user leaving the page or abandoning the process (e.g., clicking the back button or closing the browser). Instead, the next action is a click on the password input field, indicating that the user intends to continue with the login process.
   4) The final action shows the user entering their password and submitting the form, which would typically result in a successful login if valid credentials are provided.
   Since the session does not show any sign of drop-off or abandonment, it can be considered a conversion.
