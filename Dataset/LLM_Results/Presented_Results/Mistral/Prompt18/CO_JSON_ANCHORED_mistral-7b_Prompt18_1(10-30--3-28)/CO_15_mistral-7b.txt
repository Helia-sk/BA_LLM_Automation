 Tag: Session was a Conversion

   Reason: The user navigated from the restaurant dashboard settings page to the customer login page, indicating an intent to log in. After clicking the "Customer Login" button, the user was redirected to the homepage, which indicates successful login and completion of the intended action. Finally, no subsequent actions or navigation events were recorded, suggesting that the user continued with their activity on the site (or possibly left it open) after logging in.
