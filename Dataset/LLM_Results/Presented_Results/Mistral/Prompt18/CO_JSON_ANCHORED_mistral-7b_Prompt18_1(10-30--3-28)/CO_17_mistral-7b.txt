 Tag: Session was a Conversion

   Reason: The user navigated through multiple pages (customer/dashboard -> restaurants -> restaurant-details), clicked on the "Add to cart" button, and finally proceeded to complete the checkout process. This indicates that the user had an intent to purchase and completed the transaction, which is a conversion event.

   1) The user started the session by accessing the home page (/customer/dashboard).

   2) Then, the user clicked on the "Restaurants" link located at x=394, y=128, indicating that they wanted to browse restaurants.

   3) After that, the user clicked on a specific restaurant's link, which took them to the restaurant details page (/customer/dashboard/restaurant-details).

   4) The user then proceeded to click on the "Add to cart" button for the selected restaurant.

   5) Finally, the user completed the checkout process, indicating that they purchased a meal from the restaurant. This is considered a conversion event because it represents a successful transaction.
