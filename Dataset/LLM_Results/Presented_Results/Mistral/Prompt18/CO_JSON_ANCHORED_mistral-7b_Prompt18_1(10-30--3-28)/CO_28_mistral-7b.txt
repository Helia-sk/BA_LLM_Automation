 Tag: Drop-off
   1) The user navigated to the login page, indicating they are attempting to access a secure area of the site.
   2) They entered their credentials and clicked the "Sign In" button, but did not provide any information in the password field, which is required for submission.
   3) After clicking "Sign In", no further interactions were recorded, suggesting that the user either encountered an error or decided to leave the site without completing the login process.
   The lack of subsequent interactions and the requirement for a password make it likely that this session was a drop-off.
