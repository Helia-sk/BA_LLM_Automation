==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   1) The user first navigated to the "/restaurant/dashboard" page (page_view event).
   2) After that, there were several click events, but none of them led to a submission or form fill-out.
   3) There is no subsequent page view event indicating the user continued to another page on the site.
   Overall, the user's session did not lead to a conversion (such as filling out a form or completing an action that indicates intent to purchase), and it appears the user dropped off after exploring the site.
