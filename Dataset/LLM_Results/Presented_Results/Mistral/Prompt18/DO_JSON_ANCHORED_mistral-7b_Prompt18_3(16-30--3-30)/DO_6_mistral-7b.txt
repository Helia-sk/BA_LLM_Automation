==================================================

 Tag: Drop-off
   1) The user initially landed on the homepage ("/") and scrolled down, indicating some level of engagement.
   2) However, the user did not interact with any of the clickable elements on the homepage (links or buttons), which could indicate that they were not interested in exploring further.
   3) The user then navigated to the login page ("/customer/login") but did not perform any actions there either, such as logging in or signing up. This lack of interaction is another sign that the user may have lost interest.
   4) The user's scrolling behavior on the login page also suggests they were not exploring the content deeply enough to consider a conversion.
   5) Finally, the session ended without any subsequent interactions, which is consistent with a drop-off scenario.

In conclusion, this session appears to be a drop-off as the user showed initial interest by navigating to the login page but did not interact further, indicating potential loss of interest or intent.
