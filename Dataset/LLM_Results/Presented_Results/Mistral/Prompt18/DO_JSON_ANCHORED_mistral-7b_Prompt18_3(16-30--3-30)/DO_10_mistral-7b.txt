==================================================

 Tag: Session was a conversion

   1) The user clicked on the "Customer Login" link, indicating that they intended to start a new session or login.

   2) After clicking the "Customer Login" link, the user was redirected to the "/customer/login" page, where they interacted with the username input field by clicking it. This action shows that the user is actively participating in the session and attempting to log in.

   3) The user then entered "User" into the username input field and continued typing, suggesting that they were trying to complete the login process.

   4) Finally, the user typed "User123" into the username input field, which could be seen as a valid attempt to log in with a username and password combination. Since no further actions are recorded after this step, it is reasonable to assume that either the login was successful, or the user decided to continue using the application.

   As there is no clear indication of the user abandoning the session before completing the login process, it can be concluded that this session was a conversion.
