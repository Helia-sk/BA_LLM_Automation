==================================================

 Tag: Drop-off
   1) The user clicked on the "Restaurant Login" link, indicating they have navigated to the login page.
   2) After arriving at the login page, the user interacted with the username input field by clicking on it. However, no text was entered in the username input field.
   3) Subsequent interactions involve the user only moving the cursor within the username input field without typing any information.
   4) The user did not proceed to fill out the password input field or click the submit button, suggesting they did not complete the login process and likely navigated away from the page.
   Therefore, it appears that this session was a drop-off because the user did not complete the intended action (logging in).
