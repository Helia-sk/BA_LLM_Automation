 Tag: Session is a Conversion

   Reason: The user clicked on the "Customer Login" link, then entered their username ("User1") twice, once by clicking on the username input field and another time by typing it in. After that, the user clicked on the password input field, indicating they intend to enter their password. This sequence of actions suggests that the user intends to complete the login process and continue with the conversion flow. Therefore, this session is considered a Conversion.

   Steps:
   1) The user navigated to the customer login page (evidence: clicked on the "Customer Login" link).
   2) The user focused on the username input field by clicking on it once (evidence: the first "input_change" event for the username).
   3) The user entered their username ("User1") into the username input field, as indicated by the second "input_change" event for the username.
   4) The user clicked on the password input field to focus it (evidence: the click event for the password input field). This action indicates that they intend to enter their password next and continue with the login process. Therefore, this session is considered a Conversion.
