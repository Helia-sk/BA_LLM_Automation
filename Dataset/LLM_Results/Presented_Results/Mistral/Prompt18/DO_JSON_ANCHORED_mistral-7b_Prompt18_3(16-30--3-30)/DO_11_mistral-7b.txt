 Tag: Session is a Conversion
   1) The user clicked on the "Customer Login" button, which indicates that they intended to log in.
   2) After clicking the "Customer Login" button, no further events related to drop-off or navigation away from the login page were recorded.
   3) Subsequent events in the log file are associated with user interaction within the application, suggesting continued engagement.
   Therefore, based on the analysis of the log file, it appears that this session was a conversion as the user successfully logged into the system and continued to engage with the application thereafter.
