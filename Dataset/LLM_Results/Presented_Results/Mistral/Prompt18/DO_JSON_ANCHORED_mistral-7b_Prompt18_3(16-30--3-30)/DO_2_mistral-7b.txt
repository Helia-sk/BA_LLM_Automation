 Tag: Drop-off

   1) The user initially visited the homepage ("/") and scrolled down, which indicates some level of engagement. However, this is not sufficient to label it as a conversion.

   2) The user then clicked on two different links ("Customer Login" and "Restaurant Login"), indicating that the user was exploring different options within the application but did not complete any specific action or navigate to a new page.

   3) There are no subsequent events that indicate a successful completion of an intended action, such as form submission, purchase, or registration. Instead, there are only scroll and click events without further progression or confirmation of a successful action.

   Therefore, based on the provided log file, it appears to be a drop-off session because the user did not complete any specific intended action within the application.
