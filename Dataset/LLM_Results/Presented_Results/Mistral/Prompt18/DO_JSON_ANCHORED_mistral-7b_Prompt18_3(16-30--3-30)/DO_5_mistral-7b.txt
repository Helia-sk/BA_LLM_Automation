 Tag: Drop-off

  1) The user initially landed on the homepage ("/"), indicating a new session. However, there's no subsequent activity that suggests a form fill or product interaction.

  2) The user then scrolled down the homepage and clicked on a link ("Hungry?Order delicious food from local restaurants"), which typically indicates an interest.

  3) After clicking the link, the user navigated to the login page ("/customer/login"). This is usually the first step towards a conversion if the user intends to place an order.

  4) On the login page, the user did not perform any actions that could be considered as trying to log in or register an account, such as filling out a form or clicking on the login button. Instead, the user scrolled down and then left the page by scrolling back up to the top of the homepage.

  5) The user did not return to the login page or any other page that could be considered a conversion point (e.g., product page, cart). Therefore, it can be inferred that the user dropped off without completing a conversion.

  6) It is also worth noting that there are no events related to interaction with the main content on the homepage or any other pages, which suggests that the user was not engaged enough to complete a conversion.

In summary, the session appears to be a drop-off because the user showed initial interest (clicking the link) but did not take any further actions towards completing a conversion (e.g., logging in, adding items to the cart).
