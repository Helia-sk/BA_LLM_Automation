==================================================

1) Identify the user interaction events in the log file, such as clicks and input changes related to the login form.

    - The first event is a click on the "Lieferspatz" span (log_1757765662922_n1kzpnpp), but this doesn't seem to be related to the login form, so it can be ignored for now.
    - The next events are input changes and blurs on the "username" field (logs from 1757765654366_eutf57smh to 1757765653032_k2omtefm6), and a click on the "Username" input (log_1757765650904_aczosynfv).
    - After that, there are no further login-related events.

2) Determine if the user has completed the intended action (in this case, logging in) by checking for a password input event or any subsequent confirmation of a successful login.

    - There are no password input events found in the log file, which suggests that the user did not enter their password.

3) If the user did not complete the intended action and there is no further interaction after the last identified event (the click on the "Restaurant Login" button), then it can be considered a drop-off.

    - There are no subsequent events after the click on the "Restaurant Login" button, indicating that the user did not proceed with entering their password or completing any other action.

Tag: Drop-Off
[The user did not complete the login process and left the site after clicking the "Restaurant Login" button.]
