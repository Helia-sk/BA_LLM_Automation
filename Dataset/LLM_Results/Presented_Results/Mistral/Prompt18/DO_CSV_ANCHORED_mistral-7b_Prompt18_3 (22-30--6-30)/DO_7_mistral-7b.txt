==================================================

1) Determine the user interaction events in the log file, focusing on the sequence of clicks and input changes.

* The user navigates to the homepage (/), then clicks the "Customer Login" button (log_1757764057959_xoebf4g4l).
* After clicking the "Customer Login" button, the user enters their username and password in the respective input fields. This sequence includes: log_1757764058992_8f6y97suo (username click), log_1757764060646_qokcvl28f (username input change), log_1757764057959_jutmi8sow (password click), log_1757764060646_qokcvl28f (password input change).
* The user submits the login form by clicking the "Login" button. However, no such event is present in the log file, suggesting that either the login was unsuccessful or the session ended without further action.

2) Since the login was not successful and no subsequent actions were taken after the login attempt, it appears that this session resulted in a drop-off.

Tag: Drop-off [The user could not successfully log in.]
