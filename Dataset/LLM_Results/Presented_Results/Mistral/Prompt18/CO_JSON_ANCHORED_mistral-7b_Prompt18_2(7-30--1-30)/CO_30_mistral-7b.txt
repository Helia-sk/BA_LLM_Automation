 Tag: Drop-off

  1) The user has opened the session on the dashboard page and navigated to the history page by clicking the "History" button. This indicates that the user is exploring the application.

  2) After viewing the details of a specific item in the history, the user returned to the history page without performing any other actions that could indicate a conversion, such as placing an order or adding items to the cart.

  3) The user then navigated back to the dashboard page and eventually rejected the page by clicking the "View Details" button again and closing it.

Since the user did not complete any significant actions like making a purchase or adding items to the cart, this session appears to be a drop-off.
