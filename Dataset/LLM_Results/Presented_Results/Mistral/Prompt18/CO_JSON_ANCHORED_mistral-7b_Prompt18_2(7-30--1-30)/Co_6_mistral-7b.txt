==================================================

 Tag: Drop-off
   1) The user clicked on the "Customer Login" link, indicating they have navigated to the customer login page.
   2) The user did not interact with the username input field or password input field, suggesting that they did not attempt to log in.
   3) The user did not submit the login form, which is an expected action after filling out the username and password fields.
   4) The session ends without any conversion event (such as a successful login or other desired user action). Therefore, this session represents a drop-off.
