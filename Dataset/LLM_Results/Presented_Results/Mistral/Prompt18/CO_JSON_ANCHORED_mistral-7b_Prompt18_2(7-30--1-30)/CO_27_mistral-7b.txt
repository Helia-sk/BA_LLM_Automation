==================================================

1) Identify the user action that indicates whether the session is a drop-off or a conversion.
    - In this case, we are looking for an event related to the acceptance of an order, as that would be a conversion event for our restaurant application.

2) Find the corresponding events related to the acceptance of an order in the frontend logs.
    - The first frontend log has no endpoint related to the acceptance of an order and is simply a click event on a button. This does not indicate a conversion.
    - The second frontend log also does not have any information about accepting an order, so it cannot be used to determine if this was a drop-off or a conversion.

3) Find corresponding events related to the acceptance of an order in the backend logs.
    - The first and last backend logs are OPTIONS requests, which are preflight requests made by the browser before sending a POST request. This is not indicative of an actual acceptance of an order.
    - The second and third backend logs have a POST request to /api/orders/26/accept, indicating that an attempt was made to accept order 26 on the backend.
    - The fourth backend log has a response with status code 200, which means that the acceptance of the order was successful.

4) Based on the information gathered in steps 2 and 3, make a decision about whether this session was a drop-off or a conversion.
    - Since we have evidence of an attempt to accept order 26 on the backend and a successful response with status code 200, it appears that this session resulted in a conversion.

Tag: Conversion [The frontend logs do not provide enough information to definitively identify a conversion, but the successful acceptance of an order on the backend indicates a conversion.]
