 Tag: Drop-off

  1) The user clicked on the "Customer Login" link, indicating that they navigated to the login page.

  2) After clicking the login link, no further actions related to filling out the login form or submitting the form were recorded in the log file. This suggests that the user did not proceed with the login process after reaching the login page.

  3) The absence of any subsequent interactions or events such as filling out the username or password fields or clicking the submit button also supports the idea that the session was a drop-off.

Overall, the lack of user engagement on the login form following their arrival at the login page indicates that this session was likely a drop-off, as the user did not complete the intended action (logging in).
