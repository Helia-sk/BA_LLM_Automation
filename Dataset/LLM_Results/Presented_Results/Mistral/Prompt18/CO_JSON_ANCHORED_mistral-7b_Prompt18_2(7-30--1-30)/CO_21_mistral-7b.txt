 Tag: Drop-off
   1) The user navigated to the login page (/restaurant/login) from the dashboard page (/restaurant/dashboard), indicating an intent to log in or register.
   2) The user clicked on the "Restaurant Partners" link, which might suggest they are not a registered restaurant partner and are exploring the site further.
   3) After clicking the "Restaurant Partants" link, the user navigated away from the application (page view at /), suggesting they have left the site or perhaps got stuck somewhere during navigation.
   4) No subsequent actions indicating a successful login or registration were recorded in the log file, which indicates that the session did not result in a conversion (a registered or logged-in user).
