==================================================

 Tag: Drop-off
   1) The user clicked on the "Customer Login" link, indicating an intent to access the customer login page.
   2) However, the subsequent scroll and click events do not show any interaction with the customer login form or any other indicative actions that would suggest a successful login attempt.
   3) After the initial scroll and click events, there are no further interactions for a significant period of time, which could indicate user inactivity or navigation away from the site.
   4) Lack of any action suggesting a conversion (such as placing an order or filling out a form) supports the conclusion that this session was a drop-off.
