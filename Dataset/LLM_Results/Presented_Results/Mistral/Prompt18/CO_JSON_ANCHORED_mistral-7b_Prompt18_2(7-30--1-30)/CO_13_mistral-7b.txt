 Tag: Drop-off

   1) The user navigated to the "History" page from the dashboard, indicating an active session.

   2) The user clicked on a button labeled "View Details", which suggests further interaction and potential engagement.

   3) However, after clicking on "View Details", there is no subsequent interaction or event in the log file that indicates the user completed any other action before leaving the site. This lack of further activity implies that the session was not converted into a sale or any other desired user behavior.

   4) The final actions taken by the user were closing the details view and exiting the page, which suggests that they did not find what they were looking for or decided not to proceed with their intended action, leading to a drop-off.
