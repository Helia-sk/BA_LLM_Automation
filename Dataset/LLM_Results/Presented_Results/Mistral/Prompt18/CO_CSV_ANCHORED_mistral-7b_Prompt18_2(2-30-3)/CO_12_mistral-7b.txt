==================================================

1) Determine the user's action sequence in the session.
    - The user first clicked on the "Menu" link, indicating they navigated to the menu page.
    - Then, the user entered "Saladmix" into an input field and triggered an 'input_change' event.
    - Next, the user interacted with an input field again, but no value was provided this time (based on the log information given).
    - After that, the user filled out another input field with the value "Saladmix" and triggered an 'input_change' event once more.
    - Finally, the user clicked the "Add Item" button.

2) Identify if there was any interaction after the last known action.
    - In this case, no further interactions were recorded after the user clicked the "Add Item" button.

3) Determine if the session was a drop-off or a conversion based on the last known action and absence of subsequent actions.
   - Since the user submitted their input and added an item to the menu but no further interaction was recorded, it can be considered as a potential conversion. However, without knowing the specific business logic or confirmation that the item was successfully added, we cannot definitively confirm this as a conversion.

Tag: Potential Conversion [The session ended after the user added an item to the menu, but no subsequent interactions were recorded, suggesting a possible conversion. However, further analysis is needed to confirm.]
