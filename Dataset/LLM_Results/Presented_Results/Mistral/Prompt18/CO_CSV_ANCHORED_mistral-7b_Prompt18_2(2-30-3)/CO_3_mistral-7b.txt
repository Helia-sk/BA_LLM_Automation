==================================================

1) Identify the user actions from the log file:
   - The user navigates to the login page (click on "Restaurant Login" link).
   - The user clicks on the username input field.
   - The user types in a username ("User1").
   - The user clicks on the username input field again, which might indicate that they have finished typing their username.
   - The user clicks on the password input field.
   - The user does not perform any action in the password input field, so it is reasonable to assume that they did not provide a password.

2) Determine if there was a conversion or drop-off:
   - A conversion typically occurs when a user completes all necessary steps to achieve a goal, such as logging into an account or making a purchase. In this case, the user did not provide a password, so they did not complete the login process.
   - Therefore, based on the information provided in the log file, it appears that this was a drop-off session.

Tag: Drop-off [The user did not provide a password and did not complete the login process]
