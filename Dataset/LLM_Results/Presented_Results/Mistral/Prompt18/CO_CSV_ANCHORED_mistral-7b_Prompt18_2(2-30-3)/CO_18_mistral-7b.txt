==================================================

1) Identify the user action - The user navigates to the login page and enters their username (User1). This indicates that the user is actively engaging with the site.

2) Check for a subsequent user action - After entering the username, there is no further user interaction recorded in the log file such as clicking the submit button or any other action that could indicate a successful login or conversion.

3) Determine if the session was a drop-off or a conversion - Since the user did not perform any actions after entering their username, it seems likely that this session represents a drop-off. The user may have left the site without completing the login process.

Tag: Drop-off [User did not complete the login process]
