==================================================

1) Identify the first user interaction in the log file - this is the initial action after the user lands on the page.

    log_1758985849032_pt9psc4kp: frontend, input_change.v1, session_1758985838498_26779dlfk, /restaurant/login

The user initially interacts with the login form, suggesting that this is not a drop-off yet but an attempt to log in or sign up.

2) Check if there is any successful submission of the login form or a change in the page (i.e., navigating to a different page).

    log_1758985849132_sm9gb6j5r: frontend, click.v1, session_1758985838498_26779dlfk, /restaurant/login
    log_1758985849134_sm9gb6j5r: frontend, form_submit.v2, session_1758985838498_26779dlfk, /restaurant/login

The user clicks the "Sign In" button and submits the login form but there is no subsequent navigation to a different page, indicating that the login attempt was unsuccessful.

3) Look for subsequent interactions with other pages or elements that might suggest engagement beyond the initial interaction.

    log_1758985838498_26779dlfk: frontend, click.v1, session_1758985838498_26779dlfk, /restaurant/dashboard
    log_1758985847138_q23rs0wo7: frontend, click.v1, session_1758985838498_26779dlfk, /restaurant/dashboard
    log_1758985848139_r23rs0wo7: frontend, click.v1, session_1758985838498_26779dlfk, /restaurant/dashboard

The user clicks elements within the dashboard page multiple times but there is no further interaction suggesting that the user did not find what they were looking for or engaged with the content beyond initial clicks on the dashboard.

4) Determine if the session was a drop-off or a conversion based on the absence of successful engagement and navigation to a conversion goal (e.g., making a purchase, filling out a form, etc.).

Since there is no evidence of successful engagement with the content or navigation to a conversion goal, this session can be considered a drop-off.
