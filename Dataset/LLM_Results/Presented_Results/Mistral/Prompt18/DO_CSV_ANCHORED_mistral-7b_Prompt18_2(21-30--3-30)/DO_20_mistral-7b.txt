   Reason: The user interacted with the Restaurant Login button, but no subsequent action (such as inputting a username or password) was recorded in the log file. This indicates that the user may have left the page without completing the login process. Further analysis would be needed to confirm if this was indeed a drop-off or if there were other interactions not logged.
