==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   1) The user clicked on the "Restaurant Partners" link to register or log in, indicating an initial interest.
   2) The user then landed on the login page and clicked the username input field, but did not enter any information.
   3) The user also clicked the password input field without entering anything.
   4) The user clicked the login form button without entering any login credentials.
   5) After clicking the login form button, the user did not perform any other actions that would indicate a successful login or conversion. Instead, they left the page (as indicated by no further events logged).
   Therefore, it appears that this session was a drop-off as the user showed initial interest but did not complete the intended action of logging in or registering.
