==================================================

1) Identify the user interaction events in the log file.
    - The user clicks on the "Restaurant Login" link (log_1757766826727).
    - The user enters a username ("User1") in the username input field and does not navigate away from the page (log_1757766830082, log_1757766830630).
    - The user enters a password (not specified in the log) in the password input field. Assuming the password is entered and the form is submitted successfully, this would complete the login process. However, since the log does not show any such event, we can assume that the log ends before the password was entered or the form was submitted.

2) Determine if the session was a drop-off or a conversion based on the user's actions.
    - Since the log does not show any confirmation of a successful login (password input and submission), it appears that the user did not complete the login process, making this a drop-off session.

Tag: Drop-off [The session ended without the user completing the login process]
