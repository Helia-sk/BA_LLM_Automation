==================================================

1) Identify the sequence of user interactions (events).
    - The user first navigates to the page "/" at 2025-09-13T12:28:17.602Z, indicating the start of a new session.
    - After that, the user clicks on "Restaurant Login" at 2025-09-13T12:28:33.269Z, which leads to the login page "/restaurant/login".
    - The user then interacts with the username input field by clicking on it twice (at 2025-09-13T12:28:34.090Z and 2025-09-13T12:28:35.981Z). This suggests that the user is typing their username.
    - The user also interacts with the password input field once (at 2025-09-13T12:28:35.981Z) which could indicate entering a password, but no further interactions are recorded after this event.
    - No other events or interactions suggesting a successful login or subsequent page views are present in the log file.

2) Based on the absence of any subsequent events or interactions after the username and password input fields interaction, it appears that:
   - This session was likely a drop-off as the user did not complete the intended action (logging in to the application).
   [Reason] The user may have encountered an issue with their login credentials, experienced technical difficulties, or decided to abandon the action for another time.
