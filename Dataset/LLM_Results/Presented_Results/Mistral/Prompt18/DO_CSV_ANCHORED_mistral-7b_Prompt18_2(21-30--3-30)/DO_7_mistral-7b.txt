 Tag: Drop-off

   Reason: The user clicked on the "Customer Login" link but did not proceed to fill out the username or password fields, suggesting that they might have decided against logging in at that moment. This is further supported by the fact that there are no subsequent 'input_change' events related to the username or password input fields. Additionally, the user navigated away from the '/customer/login' page and went back to the homepage ('/') without any interaction with the login form, indicating a possible drop-off.

   Steps:
   1) The user landed on the homepage (/).
   2) They clicked on the "Customer Login" link which navigated them to the '/customer/login' page.
   3) After clicking the "Customer Login" link, there was no further interaction with the username or password input fields, suggesting that the user might not have intended to log in at that time.
   4) The user clicked outside of the login form and navigated back to the homepage (/), indicating a possible drop-off.
