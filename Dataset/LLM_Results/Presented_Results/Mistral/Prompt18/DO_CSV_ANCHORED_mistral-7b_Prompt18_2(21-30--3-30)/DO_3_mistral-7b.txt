==================================================

1) Identify the user interaction events in the log file.
- The user first clicks on the "Customer Login" button (log_1757763695638_oi0yeyisl).
- Then, the user focuses and types something into the username input field (log_1757763697593_pj1ybdrw2, log_1757763699210_kwlundlwi, log_1757763699767_qzhhw5h6h, log_1757763699845_hd0w6i28h).
- After typing in the username, the user focuses and types something into the password input field (log_1757763699845_hd0w6i28h, log_1757763700920_fcl31v4ry).
- The user then changes the password input field (log_1757763700920_fcl31v4ry).
- Finally, the user blurs both the username and password fields (log_1757763699767_qzhhw5h6h, log_1757763707425_gdlpkgw6x).

2) Determine if the session resulted in a conversion or drop-off.
- Since there is no subsequent event after the user blurs both the username and password fields, it suggests that the user did not submit the form.
- Therefore, based on the given log file, this session appears to be a drop-off as the user did not complete the login process.

Tag: Drop-off [The user did not submit the form after typing in both the username and password fields].
