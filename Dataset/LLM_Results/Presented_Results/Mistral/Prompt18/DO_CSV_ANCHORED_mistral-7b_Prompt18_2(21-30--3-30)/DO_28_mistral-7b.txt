==================================================

1) Identify the user action that indicates intent to complete an action (conversion). In this case, it appears that the user navigated to the "Settings" page, which could potentially indicate a conversion if the user intends to update settings for their account.

2) Determine if the user performs any actions post the initial conversion-indicating action. After the "Settings" click, the user does not seem to take any further actions that suggest completion of the intended task (e.g., saving changes, submitting a form).

3) Identify user behavior that indicates drop-off or abandonment. In this case, the lack of subsequent user interaction after clicking on the "Settings" link suggests that the user may have abandoned the session without completing the intended action.

Tag: Drop-off [User did not complete any action post-clicking on the Settings page].
