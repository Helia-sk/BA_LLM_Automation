 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user initiated the task of logging into the restaurant system (Step 1), but they abandoned that task by not entering a username (Log_1757766830082 and Log_1757766827830). Although they later clicked on the username input field (Log_1757766826727), it appears that they did not enter a valid username before clicking away from the input field (Log_1757766824990, which is missing in the provided logs). This indicates that the user abandoned the login process and did not complete all initiated tasks.

   User Journey:
   1) The user navigated to the Restaurant Login page (Log_1757766826727).
   2) The user clicked on the username input field but did not enter any data (Log_1757766827830).
   3) The user clicked away from the username input field, which could indicate they intended to enter a username but did so outside the observed timeframe or in another log entry (missing logs).
   In conclusion, since the user did not complete all initiated tasks, this session was considered a drop-off. It's important to check if all logs have been considered to ensure a correct classification.
