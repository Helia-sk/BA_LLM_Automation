 Tag: Conversion

   Reason: The user has initiated and completed all tasks in the session, including clicking on the "Restaurant PartnersRegister your restaurant or log in to manage orders" link, entering their username ("User1"), and then clicking on both the username and password input fields (indicating an attempt to enter a password). Although no password was entered before the session ended, the user's journey was completed as intended because they attempted all necessary steps.

   1) [Step 1] The user accessed the /restaurant/login page of the Restaurant Partners application by navigating from an external source or directly typing the URL in their browser.

   2) [Step 2] The user hovered over and clicked on the "Restaurant PartnersRegister your restaurant or log in to manage orders" link, indicating an intention to proceed with either registration or logging in.

   3) [Step 3] After clicking the login/register link, the user moved their cursor and clicked on the username input field, signifying their intent to enter their username.

   4) [Step 4] The user entered the username "User1" and then clicked on the password input field, indicating that they intended to enter their password as well.

   5) [Step 5] Although the user did not enter a password before exiting the session, their actions demonstrated an attempt to complete the login process, resulting in a classified conversion as all initiated tasks were completed (even if not successfully).
