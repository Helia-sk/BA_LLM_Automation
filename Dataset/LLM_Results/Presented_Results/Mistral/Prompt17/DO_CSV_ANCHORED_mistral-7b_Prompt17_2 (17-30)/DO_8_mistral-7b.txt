 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user initiated a task (clicking on "Customer Login") but did not complete it. Instead, they left the page without performing any further actions related to logging in or submitting any input for the username or password fields.

1) [Step 1] User navigated to the customer login page at http://localhost:5173/customer/login.
2) [Step 2] User clicked on the "Customer Login" button, triggering a click event with the label "click.v1".
3) [Step 3] User focused on the username input field and clicked on it, triggering another click event with the label "click.v1".
4) [Step 4] The user did not perform any further actions related to entering a username or password. Instead, they left the page without submitting the login form.
5) [Step 5] No subsequent events were recorded that indicated completion of the login process or other activities on the application.

Since the user initiated a task (logging in) but did not complete it, the session is considered a drop-off. It's essential to analyze all logs to ensure that no additional information was missed that might change the classification. In this case, the provided logs do not show any further actions that would indicate completion of the login process or other activities on the application.
