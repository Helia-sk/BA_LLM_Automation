 Tag: Drop-Off

Reason: The user initiated tasks by clicking on the username input field, but did not complete any subsequent tasks such as typing in a username or password. The fact that the user clicked on the login button twice without entering any information suggests that they may have left the site without completing their intended action.

User Journey Step-by-step:
1) [Step 1] User navigated to the restaurant's login page.
2) [Step 2] User clicked on the username input field, indicating they intended to enter their username.
3) [Step 3] User did not type in any information and instead clicked on the login button (first time). This could have been an accident or a momentary hesitation.
4) [Step 4] User clicked on the login button (second time), again without entering any information, suggesting they may have abandoned their intended action.
5) No further actions were recorded in the log file, indicating the user did not complete the login process and thus dropped off.
