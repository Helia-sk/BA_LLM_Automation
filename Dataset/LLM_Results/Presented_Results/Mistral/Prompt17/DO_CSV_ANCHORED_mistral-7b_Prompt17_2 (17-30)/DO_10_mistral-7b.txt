==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user initiated the process by clicking on the "Customer Login" link, but then did not proceed to fill out any input fields in the username and password boxes. Therefore, since one of the initiated tasks (filling out the login information) was abandoned, this session can be classified as a drop-off.

   User Journey:
   1) [Step 1] The user navigated to the customer login page at http://localhost:5173/customer/login.
   2) [Step 2] The user did not interact with any input fields in the username or password boxes, indicating they have not entered their login credentials.
   3) [Step 3] The user did not click on any other interactive elements on the page, suggesting they did not proceed to complete the login process. As a result, this session can be classified as a drop-off because one of the initiated tasks (filling out the login information) was abandoned.
