==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user initiated a click on the "Hungry? Order delicious food from local restaurants" button, but did not complete any further tasks related to placing an order. Since one of the initiated tasks (placing an order) was abandoned, the session is classified as a drop-off.
   1) [Step 1] The user landed on the homepage (/).
   2) [Step 2] The user scrolled down the homepage to the "customer/login" section (log_1757765348622_2zfheh3u8, log_1757765348732_eoh9n11qp).
   3) [Step 3] The user clicked on the "Hungry? Order delicious food from local restaurants" button (log_1757765348622_2zfheh3u8).
   4) [Step 4] The user scrolled further down the "customer/login" page (log_1757765349580_lqvyeozkn, log_1757765348732_eoh9n11qp).
   5) [Step 5] The user scrolled back up to the top of the page (log_1757765347496_p1pw8xcbv).
   It is important to note that even though the user did not complete the session by placing an order, their actions were not considered as part of a conversion because they did not perform all necessary tasks required for a conversion (placing an order).
