 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user clicked on the "Customer Login" link but did not proceed to complete the login process, which is one of the initiated tasks that was abandoned.

   Here's a step-by-step user journey:
   1) [Step 1] The user visited the homepage (http://localhost:5173/). They clicked on the "Lieferspatz" text, which did not initiate any subsequent tasks.
   2) [Step 2] The user then clicked on the "Customer Login" link, indicating they intended to start a login session.
   3) [Step 3] After clicking the "Customer Login" link, no further logs suggest that the user proceeded with the login process, which implies that the user abandoned this task and the session was a drop-off.
   I have considered all the logs provided and made my decision based on the condition mentioned in the question: if all initiated tasks are completed → Tag: Conversion. Even if one of the initiated tasks are abandoned → Tag: Drop-Off. In this case, only one initiated task (login process) was abandoned.
