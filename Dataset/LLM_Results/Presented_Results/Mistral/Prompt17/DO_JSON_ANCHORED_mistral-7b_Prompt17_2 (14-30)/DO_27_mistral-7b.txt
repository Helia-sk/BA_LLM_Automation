==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: Although the user initiated tasks by clicking on the "Register your restaurant" link, they did not complete any of the subsequent tasks such as entering their username or password. This indicates that the user might have abandoned the session before completing the intended action, hence it's classified as a drop-off.

   User Journey:
   1) [Step 1] The user navigated to the Restaurant Partners page at "http://localhost:5173/restaurant/login".
   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "Restaurant Partners" link with the text "Register your restaurant or log in to manage orders", which initiated an action.
   3) [Step 3] The user clicked on the "Username" input field, but did not enter any data, indicating they may have been preparing to enter their username. However, this was not followed by a click on the "Password" input field or the "Sign In" button, suggesting that the user abandoned the session.
   4) [Step 4] No further actions were recorded in the log file, confirming that the user did not complete any other tasks.
