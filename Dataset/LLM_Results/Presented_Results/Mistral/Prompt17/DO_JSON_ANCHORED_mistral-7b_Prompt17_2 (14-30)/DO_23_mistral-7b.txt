   Reason: The user performed all initiated tasks in this session, which includes clicking on the "Restaurant Partners" link, entering their username ("User1"), and finally submitting their password. This indicates a successful login, completing the user journey.

   1) The user arrived at the restaurant login page (/restaurant/login).
   2) The user clicked on the "Restaurant Partners" link to navigate to the registration or login page.
   3) The user clicked on the username input field, indicating they intend to enter their username.
   4) The user entered the username "User1".
   5) The user clicked on the password input field, indicating they intend to enter their password.
   6) The user did not perform any further actions suggesting they might have submitted their login credentials, which indicates a successful login.
