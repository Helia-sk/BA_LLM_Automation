 Tag: Conversion

   Reason: The user initiates a task (clicking on "LieferspatzRestaurant LoginCustomer Login") and completes it by clicking on "Lieferspatz" and then navigating to the customer login page ("http://localhost:5173/customer/login"). After that, the user continues to interact with the application without showing signs of abandoning any initiated tasks. In particular, the user clicks on "LieferspatzRestaurant LoginCustomer Login" again and then clicks on the text "Lieferspatz", indicating a continued engagement with the application.

   1) The user lands on the Lieferspatz homepage ("http://localhost:5173/").
   2) The user initiates a task by clicking on "LieferspatzRestaurant LoginCustomer Login".
   3) The user clicks on "Lieferspatz", indicating they are interested in the restaurant.
   4) The user navigates to the customer login page ("http://localhost:5173/customer/login") by clicking on "LieferspatzRestaurant LoginCustomer Login" again.
   5) The user clicks on "LieferspatzRestaurant LoginCustomer Login" for a second time, suggesting they are either trying to navigate further into the application or have made a mistake in their previous click.

   Note: All initiated tasks were completed by the user, so this session can be classified as a conversion. However, it is essential to check all logs to ensure no crucial information has been missed. For instance, if a subsequent log showed that the user abandoned the application without completing any further tasks, the classification would change from conversion to drop-off.
