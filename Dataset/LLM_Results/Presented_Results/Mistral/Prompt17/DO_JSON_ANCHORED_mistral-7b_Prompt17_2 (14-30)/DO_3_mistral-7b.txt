 Tag: Drop-Off

   Reason: One of the initiated tasks (Typing in the username field) was abandoned, as the user did not complete any further actions that were considered part of the login process.

   1) [Step 1] The user navigated to the customer login page by clicking on the "Customer Login" button.
   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the username input field, but did not type anything. This indicates an intent to enter a username, but no action was taken.
   3) [Step 3] The user clicked outside of the username field without typing any information.
   4) [Step 4] No further interactions related to the login process were observed.

   It is important to note that while the user did click on the login button, they did not complete the required step of entering a username, which was one of the initiated tasks. As a result, this session can be classified as a drop-off since one of the steps was abandoned. However, it's crucial to analyze more sessions and user behavior to have a comprehensive understanding of user journeys on your platform.
