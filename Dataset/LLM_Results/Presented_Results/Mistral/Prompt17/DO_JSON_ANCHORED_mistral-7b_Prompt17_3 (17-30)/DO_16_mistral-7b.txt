 Tag: Drop-Off

   Reason: The user initiated tasks (clicking on the username field and the SVG element) but did not complete the task of entering a username or password. As the user left the session without completing these tasks, it is considered a drop-off.

   1) [Step 1] The user navigated to the login page of the restaurant's website ("http://localhost:5173/restaurant/login").
   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the username input field (indicating they intended to enter their username).
   3) [Step 3] The user clicked on an SVG element, which may have been a part of the login form or UI, but did not complete entering their username or password.
   4) [Step 4] The user left the session without taking any further actions related to logging in.

   Although the logs do not provide information about the user's intention or reasons for leaving the session, based on the initiated and uncompleted tasks, it is considered a drop-off.
