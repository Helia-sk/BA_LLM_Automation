 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user clicked on the "Hungry? Order delicious food from local restaurants" link, which indicates an initiated task (Step 1). However, this action was not followed by any subsequent tasks related to the completion of the order process. Instead, the session ended with a scroll event that did not indicate any interaction with the order form or checkout process.

   Step 1: The user arrived at the homepage of the website ("/") and scrolled down (Log 5).
   Step 2: The user clicked on the link "Hungry? Order delicious food from local restaurants" (Log 6).
   Step 3: The user scrolled up or down the page (Log 5) and then scrolled back down to the original position (Log 4), indicating potential interaction with the content but not the order form.
   Step 4: The user performed a scroll event again, which did not seem to indicate any further interaction (Log 3).
   Step 5: The user typed something into the username input field and then clicked off the field (Log 2), suggesting potential registration or login intent but not completion.
   Step 6: The user scrolled up or down the page again, which did not indicate any further interaction (Log 1).
   Check: All logs have been considered, and no subsequent tasks related to order placement or checkout were initiated, making it a drop-off session.
