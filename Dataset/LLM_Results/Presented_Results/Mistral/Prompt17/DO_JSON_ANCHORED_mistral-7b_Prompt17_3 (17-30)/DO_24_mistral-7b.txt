 Tag: Conversion

   Reason: The user initiated two tasks (clicking on the username input field and the Restaurant Partners text), and completed both of these tasks by typing "User1" into the username input field and clicking outside of it, indicating that they have filled out their username. Additionally, the user also clicked on the password input field, but did not complete this task before the end of the session. However, since all initiated tasks related to the main goal (logging in) were completed, the session can be classified as a conversion.

   1) The user navigated to the login page of the website (/restaurant/login).
   2) The user clicked on the username input field.
   3) The user typed "User1" into the username input field.
   4) The user clicked outside of the username input field, indicating that they have filled out their username.
   5) The user clicked on the password input field, but did not complete this task before the end of the session.
   While it is not explicitly shown in the logs provided, it can be assumed that if the user had intended to complete the login process, they would have likely also filled out their password and clicked the submit button. However, since all other initiated tasks were completed, the session can still be classified as a conversion.
