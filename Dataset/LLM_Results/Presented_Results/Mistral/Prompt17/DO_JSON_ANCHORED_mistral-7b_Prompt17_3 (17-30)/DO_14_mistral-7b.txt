 Tag: Drop-Off

   Reason: The user initiated the task of clicking on the "Restaurant Login" link, but did not complete the subsequent tasks of entering a username or password. Instead, the user left the page after clicking on the username input field. This indicates that the user did not complete all the necessary steps to fully engage with the intended task, suggesting a drop-off.

   1) [Step 1] The user navigated to the restaurant login page by clicking on the "Restaurant Login" link.
   2) [Step 2] Upon reaching the login page, the user clicked on the username input field but did not enter any text, indicating an intention to enter a username.
   3) [Step 3] The user left the page without completing any further actions, suggesting that they did not intend to proceed with entering a password or submitting the form. This is evident as there are no subsequent logs showing the user interacting with the password input field or clicking on the submit button.
