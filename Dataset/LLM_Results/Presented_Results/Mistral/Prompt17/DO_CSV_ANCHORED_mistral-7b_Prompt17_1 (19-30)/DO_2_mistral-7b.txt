==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user initiated a task (click on "Restaurant Login" and "Customer Login") but did not complete it, as there is no log indicating a successful login event.

   1) [Step 1] The user started a new session with an anonymous browser ID and version 1.4.2 of the web application.
   2) [Step 2] The user navigated to the restaurant login page (/restaurant/login).
   3) [Step 3] The user clicked on the "Restaurant Login" button, but no subsequent log indicates a successful login event.
   4) [Step 4] The user scrolled down the customer login page (/customer/login), suggesting they were still active on the site but did not complete the action.
   5) [Step 5] The user scrolled back to the homepage (/) without performing any further actions, indicating a drop-off.

In this analysis, all logs from the session have been considered. However, since the user initiated a task (login) but did not complete it, the session is classified as a "Drop-Off".
