 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user initiated a task (clicking on "Customer Login") but did not complete another initiated task (entering username and password). The session was terminated without any further interaction.

   User Journey Step-by-step:
   1) [Step 1] - The user accessed the login page for the customer portal (/customer/login).
   2) [Step 2] - The user clicked on the "Customer Login" button.
   3) [Step 3] - The user navigated to the username input field but did not enter any value and did not proceed to the password input field, indicating an abandonment of the task.
   Since the user did not complete the login process, the session was terminated without a conversion. It's important to note that this analysis is based on the provided logs and does not account for subsequent user actions that may have occurred outside the scope of the log file.
