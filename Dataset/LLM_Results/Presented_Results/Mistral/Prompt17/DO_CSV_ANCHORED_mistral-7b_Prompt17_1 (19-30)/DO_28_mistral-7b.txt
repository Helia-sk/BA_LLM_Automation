 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: Although the user initiated tasks by clicking on "Settings" and "History", they did not complete any of these tasks. Instead, they abandoned both tasks by navigating away from the pages without performing any other actions that would indicate completion (such as filling out a form or making a purchase).

  1) [Step 1] The user started a new session at the restaurant dashboard page.
  2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "Settings" link, indicating an intention to access the settings page.
  3) [Step 3] The user navigated away from the settings page without performing any actions that would indicate completion (e.g., changing any settings).
  4) [Step 4] The user clicked on the "History" link, indicating an intention to view the history page.
  5) [Step 5] The user navigated away from the history page without performing any actions that would indicate completion (e.g., viewing or interacting with the history).

It is important to note that all logged events were considered in making this decision. Since the user did not complete any initiated tasks, the session was classified as a drop-off.
