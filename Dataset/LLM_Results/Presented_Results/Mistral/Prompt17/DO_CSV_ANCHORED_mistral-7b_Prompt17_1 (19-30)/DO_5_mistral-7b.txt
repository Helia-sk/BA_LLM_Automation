==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: Although the user clicked on the "Sign In" button (indicating an attempt to start a login process), it seems that they did not provide a username, which is a required field for login. The user also did not fill out any other form fields or interact with other elements on the page that would indicate the completion of a task. Therefore, based on the provided logs, the session appears to have been dropped off.

1) [Step 1] User navigates to the login page (/customer/login).
2) [Step 2] User clicks on the "Sign In" button.
3) [Step 3] User does not enter any username or password, indicating an incomplete login attempt.
4) [Step 4] User leaves the page without further interaction, as there are no additional logs indicating any other user actions.
