==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: Although the user initiated tasks such as clicking on the "Sign In" button and entering a username, they did not complete the session by providing a password. This indicates an incomplete action, classifying this session as a drop-off.

1) [Step 1] The user navigates to the restaurant login page at http://localhost:5173/restaurant/login.
2) [Step 2] The user clicks on the "Sign In" button (log_1757765739057_oh0wam64b). This initiates a task but does not complete it.
3) [Step 3] The user enters a username with value 'd' in the username input field (log_1757765735118_8yxn0gcnk and log_1757765734477_fzs50yx6q). This is an initiated task but not completed as the password was not provided.
4) [Step 4] The user clicks on the username input field (log_1757765734477_fzs50yx6q), which could be considered another attempt to provide a password, but no password value was entered before the session ends.

Yes, I have considered all the logs in my decision making and analysis of the user journey. The user did not complete the session by providing a password after initiating the tasks, classifying this as a drop-off.
