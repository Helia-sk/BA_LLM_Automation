 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user initiated a session by clicking on the "Customer Login" button, but did not proceed to fill out any form fields for either the username or password. This indicates that the user may have encountered an issue or decided against logging in at this time.

1) [Step 1] - User navigated to the customer login page (/customer/login).
2) [Step 2] - User clicked on the "Customer Login" button.
3) [Step 3] - User did not fill out any form fields for username or password, indicating potential drop-off.
4) [Step 4] - No further actions were recorded in the log file, suggesting that the user may have left the page without completing any additional tasks.

It appears that all the provided logs were considered in this analysis. The user did not complete all initiated tasks (username and password input fields), so the session was classified as a drop-off.
