==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: Although the user initiated tasks by clicking on the "Customer Login" button and filling out the username field, they did not complete the session by entering a password in the password field. This indicates that the user abandoned the process before completing the task of logging in, which is considered a drop-off.

  1) [Step 1] The user navigated to the Lieferspatz homepage (/).
  2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "Customer Login" link located at the top right corner of the page.
  3) [Step 3] The user navigated to the login page (/customer/login).
  4) [Step 4] The user clicked on the username input field and entered "User".
  5) [Step 5] The user did not enter anything in the password field, which indicates that they abandoned the process.

After analyzing all the logs provided, I have considered all the initiated tasks and determined that the session was a drop-off as one of the initiated tasks (entering a password) was abandoned by the user.
