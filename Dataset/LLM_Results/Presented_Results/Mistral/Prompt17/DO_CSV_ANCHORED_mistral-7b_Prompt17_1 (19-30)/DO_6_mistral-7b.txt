 Tag: Drop-Off

   Reason: The user initiated a scroll event on the homepage and then navigated to the "/customer/login" page, which suggests that they might have intended to sign in. However, there is no further interaction indicating a login attempt or any other action that could be considered as completing a task. The user then scrolled back to the homepage and did not proceed with any other actions, leading to an abandoned session.
