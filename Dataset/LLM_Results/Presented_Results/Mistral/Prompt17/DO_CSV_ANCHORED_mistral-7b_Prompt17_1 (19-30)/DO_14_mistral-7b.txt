 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: Although the user initiated tasks by clicking on the "Restaurant Login" button, it appears that they did not complete subsequent tasks such as entering a username and password. The log file shows that the user entered a username but did not proceed to enter a password, which is an important step in the login process.

   User Journey:
   1) [Step 1] The user visited the restaurant login page.
   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "Restaurant Login" button to initiate the login process.
   3) [Step 3] The user entered a username (dd), but did not proceed to enter a password, indicating that they may have abandoned the login process.
   Since all initiated tasks were not completed, the session is classified as a drop-off.
