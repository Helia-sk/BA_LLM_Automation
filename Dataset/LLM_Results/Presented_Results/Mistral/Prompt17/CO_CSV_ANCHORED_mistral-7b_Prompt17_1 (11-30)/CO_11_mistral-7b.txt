 Tag: Conversion
   Reason: The user initiated a task by navigating to "/customer/dashboard" and then to "/customer/dashboard/restaurant/2", which suggests an ongoing interaction. After that, the user scrolled through the page multiple times (scroll events), indicating continued engagement. Finally, the user clicked on a button, suggesting completion of a task or submission of some kind, which we see in the last log with "Added Image". This sequence shows that all initiated tasks were completed, and thus, it can be classified as a conversion.

   User Journey:
   1) The user started by navigating to the customer dashboard page ("/customer/dashboard").
   2) Next, the user navigated to the restaurant details page ("/customer/dashboard/restaurant/2").
   3) The user scrolled through the restaurant details page multiple times, suggesting they were examining the content.
   4) The user clicked on a button (not explicitly specified in the logs), which may indicate an action like adding or selecting the restaurant.
   5) Finally, the user clicked on a different element, likely the "No image available" span, and then clicked again to add an image, suggesting they had changed something about the restaurant details.
