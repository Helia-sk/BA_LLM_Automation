==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: Although the user initiated tasks such as entering a username and clicking on the Customer Login button, there is no corresponding log for the successful completion of the login process (for example, a subsequent log with "click.v1" event for a link or page related to a logged-in user). Therefore, since one of the initiated tasks was abandoned (the login), it indicates a drop-off.

   User Journey:
   1) [Step 1] The user navigated to the Customer Login page.
   2) [Step 2] The user entered their username ("User1").
   3) [Step 3] The user clicked on the "Customer Login" button. However, there is no subsequent log indicating a successful login. This suggests that the user did not proceed any further and abandoned the process, resulting in a drop-off.
