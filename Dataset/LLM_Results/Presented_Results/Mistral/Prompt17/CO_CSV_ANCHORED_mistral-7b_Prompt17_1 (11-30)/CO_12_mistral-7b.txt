 Tag: Drop-Off

   Reason: Although the user initiated a task (clicking on the "Menu" link), they did not complete any other tasks such as filling out an input field, clicking the "Add Item" button, or any other actions that could be considered completing a task. Therefore, based on the provided logs, this session can be classified as a drop-off.

   1) [Step 1] The user accessed the restaurant's dashboard menu page (/restaurant/dashboard/menu) at time 2025-09-14T07:40:12.743Z.
   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "Menu" link, initiating a task, at time 2025-09-14T07:40:12.743Z.
   3) [Step 3] The user did not perform any other actions that could be considered completing a task or interacting with the page further. The logs do not show any additional clicks, input field interactions, or button presses after clicking on the "Menu" link. Therefore, it appears that the user abandoned the session without completing any tasks.

I have reviewed all provided logs and considered every initiated task and both conditions for classification. Since one of the initiated tasks (clicking on the "Menu" link) was abandoned, the session can be classified as a drop-off.
