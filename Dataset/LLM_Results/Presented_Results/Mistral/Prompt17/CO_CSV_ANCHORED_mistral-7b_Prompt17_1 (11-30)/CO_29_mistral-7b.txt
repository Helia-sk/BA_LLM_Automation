 Tag: Drop-Off

   Reason: The user initiated tasks by navigating from the dashboard to the balance page, then to the history page. However, instead of completing any actions on the history page, the user clicked the 'X' button at the top right corner of the history page, which typically indicates closing or leaving a section without interacting further. Later, the user clicked the "History" link again, suggesting a possible intention to return and interact with the history section, but this was not observed in subsequent logs.

   User Journey:
   1) [Step 1] The user started the session on the dashboard of the restaurant application.
   2) [Step 2] The user navigated from the dashboard to the balance page by clicking the "Balance" link.
   3) [Step 3] The user then navigated from the balance page to the history page by clicking the "History" link.
   4) [Step 4] On the history page, the user clicked the 'X' button at the top right corner, which implies closing or leaving the history section without interacting further.
   5) [Step 5] Later, the user clicked the "History" link again, but no subsequent interactions were observed in the logs provided. This suggests that the user did not complete any tasks on the history page during this session.
