 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user initiated an action by sending an HTTP request to accept the order (/api/orders/26/accept), but no subsequent logs show a successful response (http_response) for this action.

1) [Step 1] The session with ID `session_1758984560651_foqjcq8xf` was started at the frontend (log_1758985707836_pm260wx8m).
2) [Step 2] The user clicked on an accept button located at `/restaurant/dashboard`. However, there is no subsequent click event indicating that the order was successfully accepted (log_1758985714781_tw6p4axzk).
3) [Step 3] No further actions were observed in this session.

The user initiated an action to accept an order, but the action was not completed, so the session is classified as a drop-off. It's important to note that all the logs have been considered for this decision.
