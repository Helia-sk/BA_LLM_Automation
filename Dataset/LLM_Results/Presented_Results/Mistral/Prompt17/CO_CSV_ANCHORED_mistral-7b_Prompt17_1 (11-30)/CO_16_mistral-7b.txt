==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user initiated a click event on the "Customer Login" button, which is considered one of the main tasks (Step 1). However, subsequent logs show that no further click events were recorded for the username and password input fields (Steps 2 and 3), which are necessary steps to complete the login process. Since one of the initiated tasks was abandoned, the session can be classified as a drop-off.

   User Journey:
   1) [Step 1] The user navigated to the customer login page.
   2) [Step 2] (Not Performed in this session) The user would typically click on the username input field to enter their username.
   3) (Not Performed in this session) The user would then click on the password input field to enter their password.
   4) (Not Performed in this session) After entering their credentials, the user would click the submit button to log in.
   Since the user did not complete these steps, it indicates that they may have left the page without completing the login process, hence classifying this as a drop-off session.
