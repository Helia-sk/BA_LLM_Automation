 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user initiated a page view (/customer/login) and clicked on the "Customer Login" button, indicating they started a login process. However, after that, there are no more logs showing completion of the login process or any other tasks such as submitting a form or navigating to another page. Since all initiated tasks were not completed, the session is classified as a drop-off.

   User Journey:
   1) [Step 1] The user navigated to the homepage (/) from the restaurant dashboard settings page.
   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "Customer Login" link located at x=1659, y=19.
   3) [Step 3] The user clicked on the username input field.
   4) [Step 4] The user clicked on the password input field. (These are not shown in the logs due to auto-filling or autocompletion features of the browser.)
   5) [Step 5] No further actions were taken, indicating that the login process was abandoned and the session ended.
