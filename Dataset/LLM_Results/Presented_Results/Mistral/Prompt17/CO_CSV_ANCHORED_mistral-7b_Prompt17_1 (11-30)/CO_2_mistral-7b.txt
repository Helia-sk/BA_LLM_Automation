 Tag: Drop-Off

   Reason: The user initiated a session by clicking on "Customer Login" (log_1757772635942), but did not proceed to enter their username (no corresponding click event for the 'username' input field). Instead, the user clicked on the link "Already have an account? Sign in" (log_1757772640076), which suggests they might have intended to create a new account or had a change of mind, but did not complete any further actions.

   1) The user visited the customer login page (log_1757772635942).
   2) The user clicked on "Customer Login" (log_1757772635942).
   3) The user clicked on the link "Already have an account? Sign in" (log_1757772640076), indicating a change of intent or action.
   However, since the user did not complete any further actions after this step, it can be classified as a drop-off session. The subsequent logs do not provide enough information to determine if the user returned to the site or completed any other actions.
