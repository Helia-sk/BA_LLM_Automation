==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The session initiated with a HTTP request to `/api/menu/` and was followed by an HTTP response. However, it seems that no subsequent HTTP requests or responses were logged for this session (i.e., `/api/menu/22`). Since one of the initiated tasks (the interaction with `/api/menu/22`) is abandoned, we classify this session as a drop-off.

   User Journey:
   1) [Step 1] The session was initiated with an HTTP request (`log_1758984560651_foqjcq8xf`) on the frontend, indicating a user visited `/restaurant/dashboard/menu`.
   2) [Step 2] An HTTP response (`log_1758985435886_4l55g8a0y`) was logged for this session, but it does not correspond to an interaction with `/api/menu/22`, which suggests the user did not interact with that specific menu item.
   3) [Step 3] The session ended with no further interactions or responses, indicating an abandonment of tasks and thus a drop-off.
