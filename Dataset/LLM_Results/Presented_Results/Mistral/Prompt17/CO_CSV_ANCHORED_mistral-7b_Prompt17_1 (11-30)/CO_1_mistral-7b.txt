==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user initiated the task of username input and password input, but abandoned the password input task, so even though the username input task was completed, the initiated tasks were not all completed.

   1) [Step 1] The user navigated to the customer login page at http://localhost:5173/customer/login.
   2) [Step 2] The user provided a username "User1" in the username input field.
   3) [Step 3] The user clicked on the password input field, but did not provide a password and left the page without completing the task.
   Note: I have considered all the logs to make this decision as the user initiated tasks for both username input and password input, but only completed one of them.
