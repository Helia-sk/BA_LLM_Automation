 Tag: Conversion

Reason: All initiated tasks in the log file have been completed. The user clicked on the "Customer Login" button, which initiated the login process (Step 1). After that, the user interacted with both input fields for username and password (Steps 2 and 3), indicating a successful login attempt. Furthermore, the user continued to interact with the username input field again, but this does not change the fact that all other tasks were completed, hence it remains a conversion.

1) The user navigated to the /customer/login page (Step 0).
2) The user clicked on the "Customer Login" button to initiate the login process (Step 1).
3) The user entered a username value into the username input field (Step 2).
4) The user entered a password value into the password input field (Step 3).
5) The user interacted with the username input field again, but this is likely a typo correction or re-entry without affecting the completion of the login process (Step 4).
