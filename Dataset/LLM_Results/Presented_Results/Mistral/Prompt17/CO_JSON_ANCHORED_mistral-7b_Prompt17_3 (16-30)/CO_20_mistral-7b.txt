 Tag: Conversion

   Reason: The user initiated a click on the "Hungry? Order delicious food from local restaurants" link, but this doesn't necessarily mean that they abandoned their initial task of logging in. They subsequently clicked on the "Username" input field, indicating they intended to enter their username. After this, they clicked on the "Password" input field, showing a continuation of the login process. Finally, they clicked on the form submit button, which suggests a successful login or attempt at login. Since all initiated tasks were completed, we classify this session as a conversion.

   User Journey:
   1) [Step 1] The user arrived at the login page (http://localhost:5173/customer/login).
   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "Username" input field, indicating they intended to enter their username.
   3) [Step 3] The user clicked on the "Password" input field, showing a continuation of the login process.
   4) [Step 4] The user clicked on the form submit button, which suggests a successful login or attempt at login.
   5) [Step 5] After the potential login, the user clicked on the "Hungry? Order delicious food from local restaurants" link, indicating they were interested in ordering food from local restaurants. This could be considered a secondary action that occurred after the main task (login).
