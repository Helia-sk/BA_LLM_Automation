 Tag: Conversion

   Reason: All the initiated tasks in this session were completed. The user clicked on the "Customer Login" link, then clicked on the username input field, entered their username (User1), and clicked the password input field, but there is no log for entering a password. However, after clicking the password input field, there is another log for clicking on the login button, which suggests that the user might have entered their password off-screen or assumed it was auto-filled. Lastly, there is a log showing the user navigating away from the page, indicating a successful login and completion of the session.

   1) [Step 1] The user clicked on the "Customer Login" link, initiating the login process.
   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the username input field, indicating they were about to enter their username.
   3) [Step 3] The user entered their username (User1), but there is no log for clicking out of the username field, which suggests they might have continued on the same line or assumed auto-completion.
