 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: Although the user initiated a task by clicking on the "History" link, they did not complete that task by viewing the details of any specific order. Instead, they clicked on the "Reject" button which indicates they might have decided to abandon the task. Additionally, the user also closed the page without performing any other actions that could be considered as completing a conversion event, such as placing an order or navigating to another page within the application.
