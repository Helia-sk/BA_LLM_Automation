==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: One of the initiated tasks was abandoned. The user clicked on the "Menu" link, but it seems they did not complete any task related to adding an item to the menu. They only clicked on another button labeled "Add Item", but no corresponding event log was found indicating that an item was actually added.

  1) [Step 1] The user opened the restaurant dashboard page (http://localhost:5173/restaurant/dashboard/menu) by clicking on a link.
  2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "Menu" link to navigate to the menu section.
  3) [Step 3] The user clicked on the "Add Item" button, but no corresponding event log was found indicating that an item was added to the menu.
  4) [Step 4] The user did not perform any other actions related to completing a task before exiting the session.

I have considered all the logs provided in your message, and based on the analysis, I concluded that the session was a drop-off because one of the initiated tasks (adding an item to the menu) was abandoned.
