 Tag: Drop-Off

   Reason: The user initiated the task of logging in to the restaurant (clicking on "Restaurant Login"), but did not complete the subsequent tasks, such as entering a username and password. The user also clicked on an input field for the password but did not enter any information. This indicates that the user may have abandoned the login process before completing it, thus classifying this session as a drop-off.

   1) [Step 1] The user navigated to the restaurant login page (indicated by clicking on "Restaurant Login").
   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the username input field but did not enter any information, suggesting that they may have intended to enter their username.
   3) [Step 3] The user clicked on the password input field but did not enter any information, indicating that they may have intended to enter their password as well. However, since no further actions were taken after this point, it suggests that the user may have abandoned the login process without completing it.
