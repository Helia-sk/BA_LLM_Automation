 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user initially clicked on a link to initiate navigation to the homepage ("Hungry? Order delicious food from local restaurants"), but did not complete any further tasks related to ordering food or logging in. Instead, the user scrolled down the page and eventually moved to the login page where they entered their username (indicating an intent to log in), but no password was entered, which is often a sign of abandonment in this context.
