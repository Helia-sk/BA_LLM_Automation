 Tag: Conversion

   Reason: The user initiated two tasks (clicking on the "Customer Login" button and filling out both the username and password fields), and completed both of them.

   1) [Step 1] User clicked on the "Customer Login" button, which navigated them to the login page.
   2) [Step 2] The user entered their username ("User1") in the username field.
   3) [Step 3] After entering the username, the user triggered a debounced input event for the username field.
   4) [Step 4] The user then clicked on the username field again to fill out the password.
   5) [Step 5] The user entered their password in the password field and triggered a debounced input event for it as well.
   6) [Step 6] No further actions were recorded, indicating that the user successfully logged in and completed their intended task, hence the session was marked as a conversion.

   I have considered all the logs to the end to make this decision.
