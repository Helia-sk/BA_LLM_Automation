 Tag: Drop-Off

   Reason: The user initiated a task (Click on "Restaurant Login") but did not complete it by entering any username, which indicates an abandoned login attempt.

   1) [Step 1] User navigated to the Restaurant Login page from the homepage.
   2) [Step 2] User clicked on the "Restaurant Login" button/link.
   3) [Step 3] User clicked on the username input field but did not enter any text, implying an abandoned login attempt. This is supported by the subsequent clicks outside of the username field without any additional inputs or actions that would indicate a successful login.
   Since the user initiated a task (login) and did not complete it, this session is considered a drop-off. It's also important to note that no other tasks were completed during this session.
