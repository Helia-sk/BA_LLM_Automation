 Tag: Drop-Off

   Reason: Although the user initiated tasks such as clicking on the "Sign In" button and entering a character in the username field, they did not complete the final step of entering a password. This indicates that the session was dropped off before completion.

   1) [Step 1] The user navigated to the login page of a restaurant application (/restaurant/login).

   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "Sign In" button, indicating an intention to log in or register.

   3) [Step 3] The user entered a character into the username field but did not complete entering their password. This is the last logged event before the session ended.

   Note: It's important to consider all logs in the analysis. In this case, even though the user performed some tasks, they did not complete all necessary steps, so the session was classified as a drop-off.
