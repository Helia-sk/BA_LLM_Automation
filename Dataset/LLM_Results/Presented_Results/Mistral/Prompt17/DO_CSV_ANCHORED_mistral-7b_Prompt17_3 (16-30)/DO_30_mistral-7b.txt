 Tag: Conversion

   Reason: The user initiated a task (clicked on "Menu") and completed it by clicking on "Accept" in the dashboard. After that, the user navigated to the "menu" page, where they initiated another task (clicked on "Add Item") and finally completed this task as well by clicking on "Add Item" button in the menu page.

   1) The user landed on the restaurant dashboard page.
   2) The user clicked on the "Menu" link to navigate to the menu page.
   3) On the menu page, the user initiated a task by clicking on the "Add Item" button.
   4) The user filled out the form and completed the task by clicking on the "Add Item" button again.
   5) After adding an item, the user returned to the dashboard page.
   6) On the dashboard page, the user clicked on the "Accept" button to accept some changes or updates.

In this case, all initiated tasks were completed, so the session was a conversion. All relevant logs were considered for the analysis.
