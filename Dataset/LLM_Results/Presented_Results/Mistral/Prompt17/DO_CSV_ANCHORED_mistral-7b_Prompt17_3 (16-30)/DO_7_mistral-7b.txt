 Tag: Conversion

   Reason: The user initiated the session by clicking on the "Customer Login" button, followed by clicking on the username input field and then on the password input field. This indicates that the user was actively engaging with the login form. After entering their credentials, they clicked the login button, which is considered a successful login if the server-side validation is successful. Since the user did not abandon any of the initiated tasks (login process), we can conclude that this session resulted in a conversion.

   1) [Step 1] User landed on the homepage (/).
   2) [Step 2] User navigated to the login page (/customer/login) by clicking the "Customer Login" button.
   3) [Step 3] User clicked on the username input field.
   4) [Step 4] User clicked on the password input field.
   5) [Step 5] User entered their credentials and clicked the login button to submit the form.
   (Assuming server-side validation was successful, this step would result in a successful login.)
   (Since all initiated tasks were completed, this session resulted in a conversion.)
