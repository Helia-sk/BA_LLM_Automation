 Tag: Drop-Off

   Reason: Although the user initiated several tasks such as clicking on the "Restaurant Partners" link, entering their username ("User1"), and even clicking on the "UsernamePasswordSign In" form, they did not complete the final step of entering their password. Since one of the initiated tasks was abandoned (password entry), the session can be classified as a drop-off.

   1) [Step 1] The user navigated to the "/restaurant/login" page on the website.
   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "Restaurant Partners" link.
   3) [Step 3] The user clicked on the "UsernamePasswordSign In" form.
   4) [Step 4] The user entered their username ("User1") into the username input field.
   5) [Step 5] The user did not complete the session by entering their password, indicating an abandonment of the task. This resulted in a drop-off.
