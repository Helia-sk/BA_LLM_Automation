==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user did not complete the intended tasks (login to both restaurant and customer pages). Although they performed scrolling actions, these are common exploratory behaviors that do not necessarily indicate completion of a task.

1) [Step 1] The session started at the homepage with the user on an anonymous browser (log_1757763606219_c2hwfdkf3). The app version was web-1.4.2 and the viewport size was 695x767.
2) [Step 2] The user navigated to the restaurant login page (/restaurant/login, log_1757763607141_b94txzhvu). They clicked on the "Restaurant Login" button but did not submit any form data.
3) [Step 3] The user performed a scroll action on the restaurant login page (log_1757763605641_ciefxrzrw), suggesting they may have been trying to find additional information or were simply exploring the page.
4) [Step 4] The user navigated from the restaurant login page back to the homepage (implied by log_1757763605641_ciefxrzrw, since the URL is /).
5) [Step 5] The user then navigated to the customer login page (/customer/login, log_1757763609230_4tmfpch76). They clicked on the "Customer Login" button but did not submit any form data. This indicates that they did not complete the intended task of logging in as a customer either.

After considering all the logs, it is evident that the user did not complete any of the initiated tasks (logging into both restaurant and customer pages), so the session is classified as a drop-off.
