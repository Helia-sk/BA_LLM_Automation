 Tag: Conversion
   Reason: All the initiated tasks (clicking on "Restaurant Login" and filling in both username and password fields) were completed.

1) [Step 1] The user initiates a session by navigating to the "/restaurant/login" page (log_1757765650904).
2) [Step 2] The user clicks on the "Restaurant Login" button (log_1757765653032), indicating the intention to start the login process.
3) [Step 3] The user interacts with the username input field by clicking on it (log_1757765653033). This is not a required step for login but can be considered as interaction.
4) [Step 4] The user types "dd" into the username input field and blurs the field, completing the username entry (log_1757765654366).
5) [Step 5] The user interacts with the password input field by clicking on it (log_1757765654954), continuing the login process.
6) [Step 6] The user types a password into the password input field and blurs the field, completing the password entry (log_1757765654366). This log is repeated due to debouncing but the action was already completed.
7) [Step 7] No further interactions or events were logged, indicating that the user has likely successfully logged in and completed their intended task, marking this as a conversion session.
