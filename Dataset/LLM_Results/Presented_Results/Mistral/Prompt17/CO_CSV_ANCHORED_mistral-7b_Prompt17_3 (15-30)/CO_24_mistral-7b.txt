==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user initiated tasks (clicking on elements like "Menu" and interacting with forms and inputs), but did not complete any of those initiated tasks, such as uploading an image or filling out a form to save changes. This suggests that the user may have abandoned the session without completing the intended actions, indicating a drop-off.

1) [Step 1] The user accessed the restaurant's dashboard menu page (/restaurant/dashboard/menu).
2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "Menu" link to navigate to the same page.
3) [Step 3] The user clicked on an SVG element, possibly with the intention of uploading an image or performing some other action, but it seems this click did not lead to any further actions.
4) [Step 4] The user interacted with various elements within the form (input fields and a FORM tag), suggesting that they intended to add or edit menu items, but no "save changes" or "cancel" actions were taken, indicating that the user may have left the page without completing their intended task.
5) [Step 5] The user interacted with more elements within the form (input fields and an img tag), again suggesting they intended to add or edit menu items, but no further actions were taken, indicating another potential abandonment of tasks.
6) [Step 6] No additional interactions or completed tasks were recorded in the log file, which further supports the assumption that the user may have dropped off without completing their intended actions on the page.
