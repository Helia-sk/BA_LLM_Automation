2) [Step 2] The user navigated to the dashboard from the home page.
3) [Step 3] The user clicked on the "Balance" link from the dashboard.
4) [Step 4] The user returned to the dashboard and clicked on the "History" link.
5) [Step 5] The user viewed details of a history item by clicking on the "View Details" button.
6) [Step 6] The user decided to close the history page by clicking on the "X" button, which indicates an abandonment of that particular task.
