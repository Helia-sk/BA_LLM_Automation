 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user initiated a task (clicking on "Customer Login") but did not complete it. After that, there are no further actions indicating completion of other tasks such as entering username and password or clicking the submit button.

   User Journey:
   1) [Step 1] The user navigated to the customer login page. (indicated by the log at 2025-09-13T14:22:51.689Z, with tag /customer/login).
   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "Customer Login" button (indicated by the log at 2025-09-13T14:22:51.689Z, with tag "A", and text "Customer Login").
   3) [Step 3] The user did not perform any action indicating entering a username or password (no logs indicate click events on the username or password fields).
   4) [Step 4] The user did not click the submit button to complete the login process.
   Since the user did not complete the login process, the session was a drop-off.
