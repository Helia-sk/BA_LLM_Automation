==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user initiated a task (click on "Restaurant Login") but did not complete it (no subsequent input or click activity was recorded in the logs). This indicates that the user may have left the page without completing the intended action.

   User Journey:
   1) [Step 1] The user visited the restaurant login page with a web browser.
   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "Restaurant Login" link.
   3) [Step 3] (No further activity was recorded, no input or click event logs were found).
   It is assumed that the user did not proceed with the login process and thus left the page, leading to a drop-off. However, it's essential to note that if more logs were available showing the user returning to the page or completing another task on the same session, this decision could change.
