Consider every initiated task and both of the following conditions in your decision making. If all initiated tasks are completed → Tag: Conversion. Even if one of the initiated tasks are abandoned → Tag: Drop-Off.Provide a reason for your classification. Then, outline the user journey step-by-step.Format your response as follows: Tag: your decision  [Reason]. 1) [Step 1] 2) [Step 2] 3) [Step 3] …  at the end Check if you considerd all the logsto the end dont guess or persume

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user initiated a login process (form_submit.v2), but did not complete it, as indicated by the subsequent input_change.v1 event for the password field which suggests that the user entered something into the field but didn't complete the form. However, after the failed login attempt, there are no further events suggesting completion of any other tasks (like navigating to the history page or submitting a request).

   Step 1: The user navigated to the restaurant login page (/restaurant/login) and initiated a login attempt (form_submit.v2).
   Step 2: The user entered their username (input_change.v1), but the log does not show the password being entered or submitted, indicating an incomplete login process.
   Step 3: No further events were recorded, suggesting that the user did not continue with any other tasks on the platform after the failed login attempt.

The analysis was based on all the provided logs and the defined conditions for a conversion (completion of all initiated tasks) and drop-off (abandonment of one or more initiated tasks). The user did not complete any task beyond the incomplete login attempt, hence it's classified as a drop-off.
