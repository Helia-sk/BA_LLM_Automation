 Tag: Drop-Off

Reasons: The user initiated a navigation to the login page, but did not complete the task of entering a username or password. Instead, they left the page after clicking on the "Customer Login" button.

1) [Step 1] The user navigated from the restaurant dashboard settings page to the customer login page (/customer/login). This indicates an initiated task (navigation to the login page).
2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "Customer Login" button, but no further interaction with the username or password fields was recorded. This suggests that the task of entering a username and password was abandoned.
3) [Step 3] The user left the customer login page without completing the login process.
4) [Step 4] No subsequent interactions were recorded, indicating that the user did not proceed to any other pages or complete any tasks after leaving the customer login page.

The user initiated a task (navigation to the login page), but did not complete it, hence classifying this session as a drop-off. All logged events were considered in this decision making process.
