 Tag: Drop-Off

   Reason: While the user initiated a request to access the menu (`/api/menu/`) on multiple occasions, they did not complete any of those tasks (as indicated by the repeated `http_request.v1` log types without corresponding `http_response.v1`). Since all initiated tasks were abandoned in this session, it is classified as a drop-off.

   1) The user started a new session with ID `session_1758984560651_foqjcq8xf` on the frontend at 2025-09-27T15:03:48.

   2) The user navigated to the menu dashboard page (`/restaurant/dashboard/menu`) and scrolled down the page (`scroll.v1` event).

   3) The user clicked on the "Menu" link (`click.v1` event), but no subsequent `http_response.v1` log was recorded, indicating that they did not receive a response after clicking the link.

   4) The user continued to request the menu page (repeated `/api/menu/` requests with `http_request.v1` log types), but there were no corresponding `http_response.v1` logs, implying that they did not complete their task on this page during the session.

   Since all initiated tasks in the session were abandoned (step 3 and subsequent steps), it is classified as a drop-off. The user did not complete any of the tasks they initiated, such as accessing the requested menu items or pages.
