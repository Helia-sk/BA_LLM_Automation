==================================================

 Tag: Conversion
   Reason: All initiated tasks were completed. The user made a click event on the "Accept" button, which corresponds to the acceptance of an order in the backend logs (the first two logs). Additionally, there is no evidence of any subsequent drop-off events in the frontend logs.

   User Journey Steps:
   1) [Session Initialization] The user started a new session on the web application (frontend). This was identified by the "session_1758984560651_foqjcq8xf" in the frontend logs.
   2) [Navigating to Dashboard] The user navigated to the dashboard page of the restaurant, which is indicated by the URL: "http://localhost:5173/restaurant/dashboard".
   3) [Accepting an Order] In the backend, a POST request was made to "/api/orders/26/accept" for accepting order #26. This corresponds to the user's action of accepting an order on the frontend.
   4) [Confirmation/Success Screen] There is no explicit log indicating a confirmation or success screen, but the absence of any subsequent drop-off events suggests that the user likely encountered a confirmation screen and completed the process successfully.
