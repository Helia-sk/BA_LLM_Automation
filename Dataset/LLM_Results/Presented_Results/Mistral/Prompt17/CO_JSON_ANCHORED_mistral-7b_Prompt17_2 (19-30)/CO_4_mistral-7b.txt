 Tag: Conversion

   Reason: The user initiated a task (clicking on the "Restaurant Login" link) and completed another task (entering their username, which is indicated by the "debounce" event for the username input field). Although there was a click event on the "Already have an account? Sign in" button, this does not represent an abandoned task as it was part of the login process flow.

   1) [Step 1] The user visited the restaurant's webpage.
   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "Restaurant Login" link to initiate the login process.
   3) [Step 3] The user entered their username in the provided input field.
   (Since no other initiated tasks were abandoned, we can conclude that the session was a conversion.)
