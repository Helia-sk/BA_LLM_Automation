==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user journey initiated with a click event on the "Menu" link, but there were no subsequent events indicating completion of any tasks. However, there was a scroll event and a click event on an SVG element which do not correspond to any known UI elements in the application, making it difficult to determine if these were intended interactions or system noise. The absence of a submit_trigger event indicates that no form submissions occurred during this session, which is consistent with the drop-off scenario.

   Outline of User Journey:
   1) [Step 1] The user navigated to the URL "http://localhost:5173/restaurant/dashboard/menu".
   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "Menu" link, indicating an intent to interact with the menu.
   3) [Step 3] The user scrolled down the page, but no further interactions were recorded that would indicate a completed task.
   4) [Step 4] The user clicked on an SVG element, but there's insufficient information to determine if this was an intended interaction or system noise.
   It should be noted that while these are all the logs available for this session, it is possible that more events may have been recorded but were not included in the log file presented here. However, based on the provided logs, there's no indication of a completed task, leading to the classification as a drop-off.
