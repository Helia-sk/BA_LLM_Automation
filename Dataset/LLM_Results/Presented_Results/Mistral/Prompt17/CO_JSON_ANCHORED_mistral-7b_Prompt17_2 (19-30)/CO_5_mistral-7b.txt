 Tag: Conversion

   Reason: The user initiated a task (clicking on the "Customer Login" button) and completed it by scrolling down to the login form, typing in their username ("10023456"), and then clicking on the submit button for the form. This indicates that the user was able to complete the intended action on the website, which is a conversion.

   1) The user navigated to the homepage of the website (http://localhost:5173/).
   2) The user scrolled down the page to view the content below the fold.
   3) The user clicked on the "Customer Login" button, which took them to the login page.
   4) The user entered their username ("10023456") in the username field.
   5) The user clicked on the submit button for the form, submitting their username.
   6) The user scrolled down the page to view the content below the fold again (this is a repeat of step 2).
   7) The user exited the session by closing the browser window or tab.

   All initiated tasks were completed in this session, so it is classified as a conversion. It is important to consider all logs in the session when making this determination to ensure that the correct classification is made.
