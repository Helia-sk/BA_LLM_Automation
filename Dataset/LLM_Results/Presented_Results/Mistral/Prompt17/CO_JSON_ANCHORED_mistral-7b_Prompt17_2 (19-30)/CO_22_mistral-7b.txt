 Tag: Conversion

   Reason: The user initiated two tasks - clicking on the "Restaurant Partners" link and filling in the username and password fields. Both of these tasks were completed, as indicated by the "click" event for the link and the "input_change" event for the username field, so the session was not a drop-off.

   1) [Step 1] The user arrived at the Restaurant Partners login page.
   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "Restaurant Partners" link.
   3) [Step 3] The user entered their username (User1).
   4) [Step 4] The user left the password field blank, but this is not considered an abandoned task since the session was a conversion.
   5) [Step 5] The user clicked on the login button (implied by the "input_change" event for the password field), which completed the login process.
