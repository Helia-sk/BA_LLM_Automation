 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user initiated tasks such as clicking on "ImageDrag image here or click to upload" and "Menu", but did not complete any of them, suggesting that they might have abandoned the session.

Step 1) The user arrived at the homepage of the restaurant dashboard.
Step 2) The user clicked on the "Menu" link in the navigation bar.
Step 3) The user navigated to the menu page where they could see the option to upload an image or click to select one.
Step 4) The user clicked on the "ImageDrag image here or click to upload" but did not complete the task, indicating that they might have decided against uploading an image.
Step 5) The user left the site without performing any other actions.

The decision was based on the fact that the user initiated tasks (clicking on the "Menu" and the image upload area), but did not complete any of them, suggesting a possible drop-off. All the logs were considered to reach this conclusion.
