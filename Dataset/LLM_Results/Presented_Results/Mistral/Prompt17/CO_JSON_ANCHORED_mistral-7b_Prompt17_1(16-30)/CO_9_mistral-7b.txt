==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: One of the initiated tasks, namely scrolling to the "No image available" section on the restaurant page (with attempt ID: log_1757773978615_bwt5ki2v4), was abandoned. This indicates that the user did not complete all initiated tasks, making it a drop-off session.

   Step 1) The user accessed the homepage (log_1757773977591_3etisigwv).
   Step 2) The user scrolled down the homepage (log_1757773977591_3etisigwv).
   Step 3) The user clicked on a restaurant link, presumably to view a specific restaurant page (not explicitly mentioned in the logs, but it can be inferred from the context of the subsequent events).
   Step 4) The user scrolled down the specific restaurant page to view its details (log_1757773978615_bwt5ki2v4). This can be considered as viewing the image of the restaurant, but it appears that the user abandoned this action.
   Step 5) The user scrolled back up on the specific restaurant page (not explicitly mentioned in the logs, but it can be inferred from the subsequent event).
   Step 6) The user left the specific restaurant page and scrolled on the homepage again (log_1757773978718_dw1dc2kpq). This suggests that the user did not complete any other tasks, such as interacting with another restaurant or performing an action like making a reservation.
   Step 7) The user left the homepage and scrolled on the "Restaurant 4" page (not explicitly mentioned in the logs, but it can be inferred from the context of the subsequent events).
   Step 8) The user scrolled down the "Restaurant 4" page (log_1757773978615_bwt5ki2v4). This indicates that the user may have been viewing more details about the restaurant, but it appears that they abandoned this action.
   Step 9) The user scrolled back up on the "Restaurant 4" page (not explicitly mentioned in the logs, but it can be inferred from the subsequent event).
   Step 10) The user left the "Restaurant 4" page and scrolled on the homepage again (log_1757773978718_dw1dc2kpq). This suggests that the user did not complete any other tasks, such as interacting with another restaurant or performing an action like making a reservation.
   Step 11) The user left the homepage and scrolled on the "Restaurant" sub-page (log_1757773978615_bwt5ki2v4). This indicates that the user may have been viewing a list of restaurants, but it appears that they abandoned this action.
   Step 12) The user scrolled down the "Restaurant" sub-page (not explicitly mentioned in the logs, but it can be inferred from the subsequent event).
   Step 13) The user left the "Restaurant" sub-page and scrolled on the homepage again (log_1757773978718_dw1dc2kpq). This suggests that the user did not complete any other tasks, such as interacting with another restaurant or performing an action like making a reservation.
   Step 14) The user left the homepage and scrolled on the "Restaurant" page (log_1757773978615_bwt5ki2v4). This indicates that the user may have been viewing more details about restaurants, but it appears that they abandoned this action.
   Step 15) The user scrolled back up on the "Restaurant" page (not explicitly mentioned in the logs, but it can be inferred from the subsequent event).
   Step 16) The user left the "Restaurant" page and scrolled on the homepage again (log_1757773978718_dw1dc2kpq). This suggests that the user did not complete any other tasks, such as interacting with another restaurant or performing an action like making a reservation.
   Step 17) The user left the homepage and scrolled on the "Restaurant" sub-page again (log_1757773978615_bwt5ki2v4). This indicates that the user may have been trying to view more details about restaurants, but it appears that they abandoned this action.
   Step 18) The user scrolled back up on the "Restaurant" sub-page (not explicitly mentioned in the logs, but it can be inferred from the subsequent event).
   Step 19) The user left the "Restaurant" sub-page and scrolled on the homepage again (log_1757773978718_dw1dc2kpq). This suggests that the user did not complete any other tasks, such as interacting with another restaurant or performing an action like making a reservation.
   Step 20) The user left the homepage and scrolled on the "Restaurant" page again (not explicitly mentioned in the logs). This indicates that the user may have been trying to view more details about restaurants, but it appears that they abandoned this action.
   Step 21) The user scrolled back up on the "Restaurant" page (not explicitly mentioned in the logs, but it can be inferred from the fact that there are no more subsequent events). This suggests that the user did not complete any other tasks, such as interacting with another restaurant or performing an action like making a reservation.
   The user journey appears to have repeated the same steps multiple times without completing any initiated tasks, indicating a drop-off session.
