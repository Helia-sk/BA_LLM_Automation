 Tag: Drop-Off

   Reason: Although the user clicked on the "Menu" link, they did not complete any of the subsequent tasks initiated on the page such as uploading an image, filling out a form, or interacting with any other elements that could be considered completed tasks. The user's interaction with the page appears to have ended after clicking the "Menu" link.

   1) [Step 1] User navigated to the restaurant dashboard page.
   2) [Step 2] User clicked on the "Menu" link located at (586, 124).
   3) [Step 3] User interacted with an svg element but did not complete any task on the "Menu" page.
   4) [Step 4] The user's interaction with the page appeared to have ended.

   It is important to note that although I have classified this session as a drop-off, it is always beneficial to analyze further and potentially optimize elements such as the design, layout, or functionality of the "Menu" page to improve user engagement and encourage completion of tasks in future sessions.
