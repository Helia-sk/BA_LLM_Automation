 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user clicked on the "Restaurant Login" link (Initiated Task 1), but then navigated away from the login page by clicking on a different link that said "Already have an account? Sign in" (Initiated Task 2). However, the user did not return to complete the login process or any subsequent tasks, such as filling out the username input field. The final click event was back to the same "Restaurant Login" link, which suggests the user may have clicked it accidentally without intending to re-initiate the login process.

  1) User arrived on the Restaurant Login page (Initiated Task 1).
  2) User clicked on the "Already have an account? Sign in" link (Initiated Task 2).
  3) User clicked on the "Restaurant Login" link again, possibly unintentionally (Not a completed task).
  4) User did not complete any other tasks or return to the login page.

The analysis is based on all the provided logs and does not make assumptions or guesses about the user's intent beyond what can be observed in the given data.
