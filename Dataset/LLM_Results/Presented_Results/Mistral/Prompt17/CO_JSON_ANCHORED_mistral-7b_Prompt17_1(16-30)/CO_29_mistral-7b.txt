==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: One of the initiated tasks (View Details in History section) was abandoned. The user did not proceed to complete any other task that is considered a conversion, such as making a purchase or completing a form.

   User Journey Step-by-step:
   1) [Step 1] The user accessed the history page of the restaurant dashboard (/restaurant/dashboard/history).
   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "X" button to close a popup or an element in the History section.
   3) [Step 3] The user clicked on the "History" link again, indicating they may have wanted to revisit the History section.
   4) [Step 4] The user clicked on the "View Details" button within the History section but then abandoned this action without completing it. This indicates a drop-off.
   5) [Step 5] The user closed another element or popup in the History section by clicking the "X" button.
   6) [Step 6] The user clicked on the "History" link again, which could suggest they intended to try accessing it again. However, since we do not have subsequent logs to confirm this action, it remains unclear if they continued exploring other pages or abandoned their session.
   Note: It is essential to consider all logs to make an informed decision about the user's journey and whether it was a drop-off or conversion. In this case, since one of the initiated tasks was abandoned without completion, we classify it as a drop-off.
