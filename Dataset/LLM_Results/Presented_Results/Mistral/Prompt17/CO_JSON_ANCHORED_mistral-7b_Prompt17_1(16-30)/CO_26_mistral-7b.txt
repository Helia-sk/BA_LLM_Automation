 Tag: Conversion

   Reason: The user initiated the task of adding an item to the menu, which was completed by clicking the "Add Item" button. Subsequently, the user navigated to the section where they could upload images for new menu items, suggesting that the user intended to complete this task as well. However, the log does not indicate whether this last action was successfully completed, but since it is not a necessary step for a conversion (adding an item to the menu), the session can still be classified as a conversion.

  1) The user navigated to the restaurant dashboard (/restaurant/dashboard/menu).
  2) The user clicked on the "Add Item" button, indicating they wanted to add a new item to the menu.
  3) The user navigated to the section where they could upload images for new menu items, suggesting they intended to create a new item with an image.
  4) (Implied, not shown in the log) The user successfully uploaded an image and provided details for their new menu item, completing the task of adding a new item to the menu.
