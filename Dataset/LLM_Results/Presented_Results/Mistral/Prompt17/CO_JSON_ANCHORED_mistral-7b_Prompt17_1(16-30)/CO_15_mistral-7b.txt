 Tag: Conversion

   Reason: The user initiated a task (clicking on "Customer Login") and completed it by clicking on an input field for username, which indicates that they have provided their login credentials. Subsequently, the user navigated away from the restaurant dashboard settings page and onto the customer login page, suggesting that they intended to log in. The fact that they then clicked on the "Customer Login" button again, followed by clicking an input field for username suggests that they were entering their login details and proceeding with the login process. Therefore, all initiated tasks have been completed, making this a conversion event.
