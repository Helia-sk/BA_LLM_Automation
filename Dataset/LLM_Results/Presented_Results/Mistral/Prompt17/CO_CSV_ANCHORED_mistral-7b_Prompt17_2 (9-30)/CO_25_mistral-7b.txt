==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: One of the initiated tasks (the click event on the Menu item) was abandoned as no subsequent logs were recorded for this session that indicate completion of any other task.

   1) [Step 1] The first logged event is a request to get the menu (http_request.v1). This indicates the user has requested data from the backend server about the restaurant's menu.
   2) [Step 2] Following this, the response for the menu data was received by the frontend (http_response.v1). The user can now see the menu items displayed on the screen.
   3) [Step 3] Next, a click event was recorded on the Menu item (click.v1). This suggests that the user clicked on one of the menu items, but no subsequent log was found indicating that this action led to another task completion or page navigation. This indicates an abandoned action, and hence, the session can be classified as a drop-off.
