 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: Although the user initiated a task by entering their username, they did not complete it and also did not proceed to enter their password. The intended task of logging in was abandoned.

   User Journey Step-by-step:
   1) [Step 1] The user navigated to the restaurant login page (/restaurant/login).
   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "Register your restaurant or log in to manage orders" link, indicating an intent to either register or log in.
   3) [Step 3] The user clicked on the username input field, suggesting they intended to enter their username.
   4) [Step 4] However, the user did not provide any username input and instead clicked away from the field, indicating they abandoned the task of entering their username.
   5) [Step 5] The user did not proceed to click on or interact with the password input field, confirming that they did not intend to complete the login process.
   Since one of the initiated tasks (entering a username) was abandoned, the session is classified as a drop-off.
