 Tag: Drop-Off

   Reason: The user initiated a task (clicking the "Restaurant Partners" link, navigating to the "/restaurant/login" page) but did not complete it by entering their username and password. This is evident from the logs showing the click events on the username and password input fields, followed by no subsequent log indicating submission of these fields.

   1) [Step 1] The user navigated to the homepage (http://localhost:5173/) from another page (presumably the dashboard).

   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "Restaurant Partners" link, initiating a new task.

   3) [Step 3] The user navigated to the login page for Restaurant Partners (http://localhost:5173/restaurant/login).

   4) [Step 4] The user clicked on the username input field but did not enter any text, indicating they might have intended to enter their username.

   5) [Step 5] The user clicked on the password input field but did not enter any text, suggesting they intended to enter their password. However, no subsequent log was recorded showing submission of these fields, which means the task was abandoned.

   The user journey ended at step 5 as the initiated task (logging in) was not completed, hence classifying this session as a drop-off. It's important to note that all logs were considered in this analysis.
