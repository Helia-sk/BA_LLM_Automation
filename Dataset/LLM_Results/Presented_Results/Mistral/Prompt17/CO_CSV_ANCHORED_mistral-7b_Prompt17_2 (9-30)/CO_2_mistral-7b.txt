==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off
   Reason: The user clicked on the "Customer Login" button, which initiates the login process. However, after clicking the button, there are no subsequent logs indicating that the user completed the login process (e.g., entering a username and password). Instead, there are several logs showing the user clicking on other elements on the page, suggesting potential exploration or confusion, but no indication of completing the intended task (login).

   User Journey:
   1) The user navigated to the "/customer/login" page.
   2) The user clicked on the "Customer Login" button.
   3) The user clicked on the username input field but did not enter any text.
   4) The user clicked on the password input field but did not enter any text.
   5) The user clicked on the username input field again.
   6) The user clicked on the "Already have an account? Sign in" link, suggesting that the user may have been considering signing up instead of logging in.
   7) The user clicked on the password input field again.
   8) The user clicked on the username input field for a third time.
   Since the intended task (login) was not completed, and there is no indication that the user returned to complete it later, this session can be classified as a drop-off.
