==================================================

 Tag: Drop-Off

   Reason: The user initiated the task of clicking on the "Customer Login" button, which indicates the beginning of a login process. However, subsequent logs show that the user did not complete any further tasks related to logging in such as entering a username or password. Since one of the initiated tasks (login) was abandoned, the session can be classified as a drop-off.

   1) [Step 1] The user navigated to the customer login page.
   2) [Step 2] The user clicked on the "Customer Login" button to initiate the login process.
   3) [Step 3] The user did not enter any username or password, indicating that they did not complete the login process.

   It is important to note that this decision is based on the available logs and if additional information about the user's actions were available, it could potentially change the classification of the session. For example, if the user returned to the page and completed the login at a later time, the session would be considered a conversion instead of a drop-off.
