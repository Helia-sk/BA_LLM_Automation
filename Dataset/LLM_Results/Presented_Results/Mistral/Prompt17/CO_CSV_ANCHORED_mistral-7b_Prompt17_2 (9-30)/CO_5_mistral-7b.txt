 Tag: Drop-Off

Reason: The user initiated a task (clicking on the "Customer Login" button) but did not complete it, indicating that they may have left the website. Other tasks such as scrolling and clicking on other elements were completed, but these are common user actions that do not necessarily indicate a conversion.

1) [Step 1] The user navigated to the homepage of the website (http://localhost:5173/).
2) [Step 2] The user scrolled down the page (scroll event).
3) [Step 3] The user clicked on a "Customer Login" button located at x = 598, y = 37 (click.v1 event).
4) [Step 4] The user scrolled back to the top of the page (scroll event).
5) [Step 5] The user clicked on a "Username" label (click.v1 event), likely intending to enter their username for login but did not follow through with entering any text or clicking on the username input field.
6) [Step 6] The user scrolled down the page again (scroll event).
7) [Step 7] The user did not perform any actions that indicate they entered their password and clicked the "Login" button, suggesting that they may have left the website.

It's important to note that all logs were reviewed for this analysis, but since the user did not complete the login process, which is a crucial step in the conversion funnel, the session was classified as a drop-off.
