 Tag: Conversion

   Reason: The user initiated the session by clicking on the "Customer Login" link, then clicked on the "Username" input field and typed something in, suggesting they were entering a username. After that, they clicked on the "Password" input field and performed similar actions, indicating they were entering their password. Finally, they clicked on the submit button to complete the login process. Since all initiated tasks have been completed, this session is considered a conversion.
