Prompt: Analyze the following log file. Determine if the session was a drop-off or a conversion. Provide a reason for your classification. Then, outline the user journey step-by-step. Format your response as follows: Tag: Conversion||Drop-Off  [Reason]. 1) [Step 1] 2) [Step 2] 3) [Step 3] …
==================================================

**Tag: Conversion** – The session ends with a successful `POST /api/orders/21/complete` that returned HTTP 200, indicating the order was marked as completed (i.e., a conversion).

**Reason:** The backend logs show the order‑completion endpoint (`orders.mark_order_completed`) was called and responded with status 200, confirming the user finished the purchase flow.

**User journey (step‑by‑step):**  
1. **GET /api/orders/** – Retrieve the list of orders (response 200, 838 bytes).  
2. **GET /api/orders/21/details** – Open the details page for order #21 (response 200, 332 bytes).  
3. **OPTIONS /api/orders/21/complete** – Browser performs a CORS pre‑flight request before the state‑changing call (response 200, 0 bytes).  
4. **POST /api/orders/21/complete** – Submit the “complete order” action; backend marks the order as completed and returns HTTP 200 (response 58 bytes).  

The sequence shows a full purchase funnel ending in a successful order completion, thus a conversion.
