Prompt: Analyze the following log file. Determine if the session was a drop-off or a conversion. Provide a reason for your classification. Then, outline the user journey step-by-step. Format your response as follows: Tag: Conversion||Drop-Off  [Reason]. 1) [Step 1] 2) [Step 2] 3) [Step 3] …
==================================================

**Tag: Conversion** [The session includes a `POST /api/customer/place_order` that returned HTTP 201 Created, indicating a successful order placement – the primary conversion event.]  

1) **GET /api/customer/orders/** – User requests their orders list (request logged, then a 200 OK response with JSON payload).  
2) **GET /api/customer/dashboard/orders/** – User opens the dashboard/order‑history view (request logged, then a 200 OK response).  
3) **POST /api/customer/place_order** – User submits an order (request logged, then a 201 Created response confirming the order was placed).  
4) **OPTIONS /api/customer/place_order** – Browser performs a CORS pre‑flight request (request logged, then a 200 OK response).  
5) **POST /api/customer/place_order** – User (or the app) attempts another order submission, which fails (request logged, then a 400 Bad Request response).  
6) **OPTIONS /api/customer/place_order** – Another CORS pre‑flight request (request logged, then a 200 OK response).  

The presence of the successful 201 response marks the session as a conversion, even though a subsequent attempt resulted in an error.
