Prompt: Analyze the following log file. Determine if the session was a drop-off or a conversion. Provide a reason for your classification. Then, outline the user journey step-by-step. Format your response as follows: Tag: Conversion||Drop-Off  [Reason]. 1) [Step 1] 2) [Step 2] 3) [Step 3] …
==================================================

**Tag:** Conversion [Reason: The session includes a successful login (POST /api/customer/login → 200) followed by a POST to /api/customer/place_order that returned 201 Created, indicating an order was placed.]  

1) User opens the login page and interacts with the form (multiple **input_change** events).  
2) User clicks the login button (**click** events) and submits the form (**form_submit**).  
3) Front‑end sends a **POST /api/customer/login** request; backend responds with **200** (authentication succeeded).  
4) After login, the app loads the customer’s order overview: **GET /api/customer/orders/** (several 200 responses) and **GET /api/customer/dashboard/orders/** (200).  
5) User initiates a purchase; the browser performs an **OPTIONS** pre‑flight for **/api/customer/place_order**, receives **200**, then sends **POST /api/customer/place_order**. Backend returns **201 Created** – the order is placed.  
6) The app fetches the newly created order’s details: **GET /api/customer/orders/25/details** (200).  
7) The order list is refreshed again with additional **GET /api/customer/orders/** calls (200).  

The presence of a confirmed order creation (status 201) marks this session as a conversion rather than a drop‑off.
