Prompt: Analyze the following log file. Determine if the session was a drop-off or a conversion. Provide a reason for your classification. Then, outline the user journey step-by-step. Format your response as follows: Tag: Conversion||Drop-Off  [Reason]. 1) [Step 1] 2) [Step 2] 3) [Step 3] …
==================================================

**Tag:** Conversion **[Reason]** – The session includes a `form_submit` event followed by a successful `POST /api/menu/` request that returned **201 Created**, indicating the user completed the intended action (adding a menu item). Subsequent `GET /api/menu/` calls retrieved the updated menu, confirming the conversion.

**User Journey (step‑by‑step):**  
1) User lands on the menu management page: `/restaurant/dashboard/menu`.  
2) User interacts with the page – multiple **click** events on UI elements (e.g., opening the “Add Item” dialog).  
3) User fills out the form – several **input_change** events capture text entry for item name, price, etc.  
4) User finalizes the entry and triggers a **form_submit** event.  
5) Front‑end sends a **POST** request to the backend endpoint `menu.add_menu_item` (`/api/menu/`).  
6) Backend processes the request and responds with **201 Created**, confirming the new menu item was saved.  
7) Front‑end refreshes the list by issuing a **GET** request to `menu.get_menu_items` (`/api/menu/`).  
8) Backend returns **200 OK** with the updated menu data, which is displayed to the user.  

The presence of the successful POST (201) after the form submission confirms a conversion rather than a drop‑off.
