2) Server replies 200 OK to the OPTIONS request.  
3) Browser issues a **POST** to `/api/customer/register` to create a new account.

5) User is taken to the login page (`/customer/login`) and begins interacting: multiple **click** and **input_change** events as they enter credentials.  
6) User clicks the login button and a **form_submit** event is logged, attempting to log in after the successful registration.
