Prompt: Analyze the following log file. Determine if the session was a drop-off or a conversion. Provide a reason for your classification. Then, outline the user journey step-by-step. Format your response as follows: Tag: Conversion||Drop-Off  [Reason]. 1) [Step 1] 2) [Step 2] 3) [Step 3] …
==================================================

**Tag:** Conversion **[Reason]** – The session includes a successful `form_submit` on the login page, a 200 OK response from the `/api/login` endpoint, subsequent authenticated actions (fetching orders) and a final `/api/logout` call. This sequence shows the user completed the intended goal (login and activity) rather than abandoning the flow.

**User Journey (step‑by‑step)**  

1. **Landing on the login page** – Front‑end events (`click`, `input_change`) are recorded for route `/restaurant/login` (session `session_1758984488691_usmq9gkjt`).  
2. **Entering credentials** – Multiple `input_change` events indicate the user typed username/password.  
3. **Submitting the login form** – A `form_submit` event is logged for the same route.  
4. **Login request sent** – Backend logs show a `POST /api/login` request (`event_name: http_request`) followed by a `http_response` with status 200 and a JSON payload (58 bytes).  
5. **Authenticated activity** – After login, the client requests the orders list: `GET /api/orders/` (request and 200 OK response, 2803 bytes).  
6. **Pre‑flight OPTIONS calls** – For both `/api/login` and `/api/logout`, `OPTIONS` requests/responses (status 200) occur as CORS pre‑flight checks.  
7. **User logs out** – A final `POST /api/logout` request is made and returns 200 OK, indicating the session was cleanly terminated.  

The presence of a successful login, subsequent authenticated actions, and an explicit logout confirms a **conversion** rather than a drop‑off.
