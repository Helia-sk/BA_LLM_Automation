Prompt: Analyze the following log file. Determine if the session was a drop-off or a conversion. Provide a reason for your classification. Then, outline the user journey step-by-step. Format your response as follows: Tag: Conversion||Drop-Off  [Reason]. 1) [Step 1] 2) [Step 2] 3) [Step 3] …
==================================================

**Tag:** Conversion **[Reason]** – The user submitted the login form (`event_name: "form_submit"`), and the backend recorded a successful POST to `/api/customer/login` with a 200 status code, indicating the login was processed successfully.

**User Journey (step‑by‑step)**  
1. **Page view /customer/login** – User arrives at the login page (implied by subsequent frontend events).  
2. **Input changes** – Multiple `input_change` events capture the user typing their credentials (email, password, etc.).  
3. **Clicks on submit** – `click` events on the login button precede the form submission.  
4. **Form submission** – `event_name: "form_submit"` signals the user pressed “Log In”.  
5. **CORS pre‑flight** – Browser sends an `OPTIONS` request to `/api/customer/login`; backend returns `200` (pre‑flight approved).  
6. **Login request** – Browser sends a `POST` request to `/api/customer/login` with the entered credentials.  
7. **Successful response** – Backend responds with `status_code: 200` and a small JSON payload, confirming the login succeeded.  

The sequence ends with a successful authentication, so the session is classified as a **conversion**.
