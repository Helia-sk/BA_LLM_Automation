Prompt: Analyze the following log file. Determine if the session was a drop-off or a conversion. Provide a reason for your classification. Then, outline the user journey step-by-step. Format your response as follows: Tag: Conversion||Drop-Off  [Reason]. 1) [Step 1] 2) [Step 2] 3) [Step 3] …
==================================================

**Tag:** Conversion **[Reason]** – The session ends with a successful `POST /api/customer/place_order` returning HTTP 201 (Created), indicating the user completed an order.  

**User Journey (chronological steps)**  
1. **Visit login page** – Front‑end events (`click`, `input_change`) on route `/customer/login`.  
2. **Submit login form** – Front‑end `form_submit` event on the same route.  
3. **Pre‑flight request** – Backend `OPTIONS /api/customer/login` (200).  
4. **Authenticate** – Backend `POST /api/customer/login` (200) → user logged in successfully.  
5. **Load dashboard/order history** – Backend `GET /api/customer/dashboard/orders/` (200) and several `GET /api/customer/orders/` (200) calls to fetch existing orders.  
6. **Place a new order** – Backend `OPTIONS /api/customer/place_order` (200) followed by `POST /api/customer/place_order` (201) → order created.  
7. **Refresh order list** – Backend `GET /api/customer/orders/` (200) called again, now reflecting the newly placed order.  

The presence of a confirmed order creation (HTTP 201) marks this session as a conversion rather than a drop‑off.
