Prompt: Analyze the following log file. Determine if the session was a drop-off or a conversion. Provide a reason for your classification. Then, outline the user journey step-by-step. Format your response as follows: Tag: Conversion||Drop-Off  [Reason]. 1) [Step 1] 2) [Step 2] 3) [Step 3] …
==================================================

**Tag: Conversion** [The session ends with a successful `POST /api/register` that returned HTTP 201 Created after the user submitted the form, indicating the user completed the intended conversion (registration).]  

1. **Page load – /restaurant/login** – The anonymous user opens the login/registration page (implicit start of the session).  
2. **User interaction – frontend events** – A series of `click`, `scroll`, and many `input_change` events are logged as the user fills out the form fields (email, password, etc.).  
3. **Form submission** – The `form_submit` event (`log_1757772927364_vc95moobv`) records that the user submitted the registration form.  
4. **CORS pre‑flight** – The browser sends an `OPTIONS` request to `/api/register`; the backend responds with `200 OK` (log `64ac95cd‑f870‑4361‑a521‑8171e501a508`).  
5. **Registration request** – The browser posts the form data to `/api/register`; the backend returns `201 Created` (log `880de5c3‑cba3‑4053‑b828‑fd0bcca44ff7`), confirming the user was successfully registered.  
6. **Post‑registration activity** – After registration, the client makes `GET /api/orders` calls (logs with `orders.get_orders` returning `200 OK`), likely to load the newly‑created user’s order list.  

The presence of a successful registration response (`201`) after the form submission marks this session as a **conversion** rather than a drop‑off.
