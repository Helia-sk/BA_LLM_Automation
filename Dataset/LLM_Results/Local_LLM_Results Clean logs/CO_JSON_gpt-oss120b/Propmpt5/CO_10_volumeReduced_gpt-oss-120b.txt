==================================================

**Tag:** Conversion **[Reason]** – The session includes a successful `POST /api/customer/place_order` that returned HTTP 201 (Created), indicating the user completed a purchase. Subsequent calls to view the new order and account balance confirm the transaction was processed.

**User Journey (step‑by‑step):**

1. **View existing orders** – `GET /api/customer/orders/` (request → 200 OK).  
2. **Check dashboard order summary** – `GET /api/customer/dashboard/orders/` (request → 200 OK).  
3. **Place a new order** –  
   a. Pre‑flight `OPTIONS /api/customer/place_order` (200 OK).  
   b. `POST /api/customer/place_order` (request → 201 Created).  
4. **View details of the newly created order** – `GET /api/customer/orders/21/details` (request → 200 OK).  
5. **Refresh the orders list** – another `GET /api/customer/orders/` (request → 200 OK).  
6. **Check account balance after purchase** – `GET /api/customer/balance` (request → 200 OK).
