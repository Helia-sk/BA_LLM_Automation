Prompt: Analyze the following log file. Determine if the session was a drop-off or a conversion. Provide a reason for your classification. Then, outline the user journey step-by-step. Format your response as follows: Tag: Conversion||Drop-Off  [Reason]. 1) [Step 1] 2) [Step 2] 3) [Step 3] …
==================================================

**Tag: Conversion** – The session culminated in a successful `POST /api/login` that returned HTTP 200, indicating the user authenticated. Subsequent authenticated request to `GET /api/orders` also succeeded, confirming the user proceeded beyond the login step rather than abandoning the flow.

**User Journey (step‑by‑step)**  

1. **Landing on the login page** – The user opens `/restaurant/login` (implicit start of the session).  
2. **Filling the form** – A series of `input_change` events are recorded as the user types credentials.  
3. **Clicking the login button** – Multiple `click` events on the login form are logged.  
4. **Submitting the form** – A `form_submit` event is captured for `/restaurant/login`.  
5. **Browser sends pre‑flight request** – An `OPTIONS /api/login` request (backend log) receives a 200 response.  
6. **Authentication request** – The frontend issues a `POST /api/login` with the entered credentials; the backend returns HTTP 200, confirming a successful login.  
7. **Post‑login activity** – The application immediately requests the user’s data via `GET /api/orders`, which also returns HTTP 200, showing the user continued to the next functional step.  

Because the authentication request succeeded and the user proceeded to retrieve protected resources, the session is classified as a **conversion** rather than a drop‑off.
