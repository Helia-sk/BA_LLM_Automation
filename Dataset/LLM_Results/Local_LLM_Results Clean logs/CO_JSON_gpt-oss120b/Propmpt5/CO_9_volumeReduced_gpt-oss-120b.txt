Prompt: Analyze the following log file. Determine if the session was a drop-off or a conversion. Provide a reason for your classification. Then, outline the user journey step-by-step. Format your response as follows: Tag: Conversion||Drop-Off  [Reason]. 1) [Step 1] 2) [Step 2] 3) [Step 3] …
==================================================

**Tag: Conversion** – The session resulted in a successful order placement (`POST /api/customer/place_order` returned **201 Created**) and the new order appears in subsequent order‑list requests, indicating the user completed the desired conversion.  

**User Journey:**  
1) **GET /api/customer/orders** – User requests their order list (request logged, then a 200 OK response with JSON).  
2) **GET /api/customer/orders** – A second request to the same endpoint (request logged, then another 200 OK response).  
3) **GET /api/customer/dashboard/orders** – User navigates to the dashboard view of orders (request logged, then a 200 OK response).  
4) **POST /api/customer/place_order** – User submits a new order (request logged, then a 201 Created response confirming the order was placed).  
5) **OPTIONS /api/customer/place_order** – Browser sends a CORS pre‑flight request for the POST (request logged, then a 200 OK response).  
6) **GET /api/customer/orders** – After placing the order, the user refreshes or revisits the order list (request logged, then a 200 OK response showing the updated order history).  

The presence of the 201 response for the order‑creation endpoint confirms a conversion rather than a drop‑off.
