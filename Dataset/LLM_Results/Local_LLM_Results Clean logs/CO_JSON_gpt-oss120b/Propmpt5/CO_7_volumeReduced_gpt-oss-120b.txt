Prompt: Analyze the following log file. Determine if the session was a drop-off or a conversion. Provide a reason for your classification. Then, outline the user journey step-by-step. Format your response as follows: Tag: Conversion||Drop-Off  [Reason]. 1) [Step 1] 2) [Step 2] 3) [Step 3] …
==================================================

**Tag: Conversion** – The session ends with a successful order creation (`POST /api/customer/place_order` returned **201 Created**) and subsequent retrieval of the updated orders list, indicating the user completed the desired conversion goal.  

**User Journey (chronological steps)**  
1) **Visit & interact with login page** – Front‑end logs show a series of `input_change`, `click`, and a `form_submit` event on `/customer/login`.  
2) **Submit login credentials** – Backend receives a `POST /api/customer/login` request and returns **200 OK**, confirming successful authentication.  
3) **View order dashboard** – The authenticated user requests the order overview (`GET /api/customer/dashboard/orders/`) and receives a **200 OK** response with order data.  
4) **Place a new order** – The user initiates a purchase via `POST /api/customer/place_order`; the server responds with **201 Created**, confirming the order was placed.  
5) **Refresh order list** – After the purchase, the client fetches the updated orders (`GET /api/customer/orders/` twice), each returning **200 OK** with the latest order information.  

The presence of a completed order placement (`201` response) marks this session as a conversion rather than a drop‑off.
