Prompt: Analyze the following log file. Determine if the session was a drop-off or a conversion. Provide a reason for your classification.
==================================================

**Classification:** **Conversion**

**Why:**  

1. **Frontend activity shows a clear intent to convert** – the anonymous session (`session_1758984560651_foqjcq8xf`) generated a series of UI events on the login page, culminating in a `form_submit` event (`log_1758985136376_swc5dwl0h`). This indicates the user attempted to log in.

2. **Backend logs confirm the login succeeded** – immediately after the frontend `form_submit`, the backend recorded a `POST` request to `/api/login` (`attempt_id: 45804f29‑4a34‑42cd‑99d6‑5d032072d876`) followed by a corresponding `http_response` with **status 200** (`attempt_id: e7a6a992‑937f‑48bb‑a924‑2fc5e89594d9`). A 200 response on the login endpoint means the credentials were accepted and the session was established.

3. **No subsequent “error” or “abort” events** – there are no error responses, redirects to an error page, or a sudden stop after the form submission. The successful login response is the final meaningful action in the log.

Because the user completed the intended action (a successful login) rather than abandoning the flow, the session should be recorded as a **conversion**.
