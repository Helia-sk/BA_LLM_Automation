Prompt: Analyze the following log file. Determine if the session was a drop-off or a conversion. Provide a reason for your classification.
==================================================

**Classification:** **Conversion**

**Reasoning**

| Step | Endpoint / Action | Method | Status Code | What it tells us |
|------|-------------------|--------|-------------|------------------|
| 1 | `orders.mark_order_completed` | `POST /api/orders/21/complete` | **200** | The backend successfully recorded that order #21 was marked as completed. A `200` response on the *order‑completion* endpoint is the definitive signal that the user finished the purchase funnel. |
| 2 | `orders.get_order_details` | `GET /api/orders/21/details` | 200 | The client fetched the details of the just‑completed order – a typical post‑purchase verification step. |
| 3 | `orders.get_orders` (multiple calls) | `GET /api/orders/` | 200 | The client refreshed the order list, now expected to include the newly‑completed order. |
| 4 | `OPTIONS` requests for the `complete` endpoint | `OPTIONS /api/orders/21/complete` | 200 | Pre‑flight CORS checks that succeeded; they do not affect conversion status but show normal API usage. |
| 5 | All request logs have matching response logs with **no error codes** (no 4xx/5xx). | – | – | The entire session proceeded without failures. |

**Why this is a conversion rather than a drop‑off**

- The **key conversion event** (`POST /api/orders/21/complete`) returned **HTTP 200**, indicating the order was successfully processed.
- Subsequent successful reads (`GET /api/orders/21/details`, `GET /api/orders/`) show the system (and presumably the user) confirming the completed order.
- There are **no error responses**, timeouts, or aborted requests that would suggest the user abandoned the flow.

Therefore, the session represents a **successful conversion**.
