Prompt: Analyze the following log file. Determine if the session was a drop-off or a conversion. Provide a reason for your classification.
==================================================

**Classification:** Drop‑off  

**Reasoning**

1. **Frontend activity (the user‑facing session)**  
   - The only events tied to the user session `session_1758984560651_foqjcq8xf` are three frontend logs: two **clicks** and one **scroll** on the route `/restaurant/dashboard/menu`.  
   - There are no further frontend events that would indicate a conversion step such as *add‑to‑cart*, *checkout*, *payment*, *order‑confirmation*, or any custom “conversion” event.

2. **Backend activity**  
   - The backend logs all have `session_id: "backend"` and are unrelated to the anonymous user session. They show API calls (DELETE, OPTIONS, GET) that appear to be internal maintenance or service‑to‑service requests, not actions initiated by the user whose session we are evaluating.

3. **Absence of conversion markers**  
   - A conversion is typically identified by a distinct event (e.g., `event_name: "purchase"`, `status_code: 200` on an order endpoint, a redirect to a thank‑you page, etc.). None of these appear in the log for the anonymous session.

Because the session ends after a few UI interactions with the menu page and no conversion‑related event is recorded, the session should be classified as a **drop‑off**.
