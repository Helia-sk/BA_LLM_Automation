Prompt: Analyze the following log file. Determine if the session was a drop-off or a conversion. Provide a reason for your classification.
==================================================

**Classification:** Conversion  

**Reasoning**

- The session (identified by `session_id: "backend"`) performed a **POST** to the `orders.accept_order` endpoint (`/api/orders/26/accept`).  
- The corresponding **http_response** entry shows a **200 OK** status (`status_code: 200`) with a non‑null `response_size` (47 bytes), indicating the request was processed successfully.  
- An **OPTIONS** pre‑flight request also returned **200 OK**, confirming that the request was allowed and completed without errors.  

Since the key conversion action—accepting the order—succeeded with a successful HTTP 200 response, the session represents a conversion rather than a drop‑off.
