Prompt: Analyze the following log file. Determine if the session was a drop-off or a conversion. Provide a reason for your classification.
==================================================

**Classification:** **Conversion**

**Why this session is a conversion**

| Step | Log entry (excerpt) | What happened | Why it matters |
|------|---------------------|---------------|----------------|
| 1‑4  | `GET /api/customer/orders/` (status 200) | The client fetched the list of existing orders. | Indicates the user is already logged in / has a customer session. |
| 5‑6  | `GET /api/customer/dashboard/orders/` (status 200) | The client loaded the order‑history dashboard. | Shows the user is navigating toward a purchase‑related area. |
| 7‑8  | `POST /api/customer/place_order` (status 201) | **Order was created** – the server returned *201 Created* with a small JSON payload. | A 201 response is the canonical signal that the purchase was successfully completed. |
| 9‑10 | `OPTIONS /api/customer/place_order` (status 200) | CORS pre‑flight for the POST request. | Technical detail confirming the POST was allowed. |
| 11‑12| `POST /api/customer/login` (status 200) | User logged in successfully. | Required before an order can be placed. |
| 13‑14| `OPTIONS /api/customer/login` (status 200) | CORS pre‑flight for the login request. | Again, technical support for the login. |
| 15‑24| Front‑end events (`input_change`, `click`, `form_submit`) on `/customer/login` | The user entered credentials and submitted the login form. | Shows the user journey that led to the successful login and subsequent order. |

**Key conversion indicator:**  
The backend log entry with `event_name: "http_response"` for the endpoint `customer_place_order.place_order` returned **status_code 201** (`"response_size": 63`). In a typical e‑commerce flow, a `201 Created` response from a `POST /api/customer/place_order` endpoint means the order has been recorded and the transaction is complete.

Because the session contains a successful order‑creation request after a login flow, the overall outcome is a **conversion** rather than a drop‑off.
