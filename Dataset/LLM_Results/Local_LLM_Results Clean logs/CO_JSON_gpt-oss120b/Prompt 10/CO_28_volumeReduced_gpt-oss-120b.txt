Prompt: Analyze the following log file. Determine if the session was a drop-off or a conversion. Provide a reason for your classification.
==================================================

**Result:** **Drop‑off**  

**Why**

| Indicator | What the log shows | Interpretation |
|-----------|-------------------|----------------|
| **Frontend session ID** | All user‑facing events belong to `session_1758985838498_26779dlfk`. | This is the session we need to evaluate. |
| **Event sequence** | 1️⃣ `input_change` on `/restaurant/login`  <br>2️⃣ `click` on the same page  <br>3️⃣ `form_submit` (login attempt). | The user interacted with the login form but never generated any follow‑up events (e.g., successful login, navigation to a dashboard, order creation, etc.). |
| **Success / conversion markers** | No event such as `login_success`, `order_created`, `order_completed`, `checkout_success`, or any redirect to a protected area. | No evidence that the user completed the intended action. |
| **Backend logs** | All backend entries have `session_id: "backend"` and are unrelated to the anonymous frontend session. They show order‑related API calls (GET orders, GET order details, POST order‑complete) that belong to an internal service, not the user trying to log in. | They cannot be used to infer conversion for the anonymous session. |
| **Absence of further activity** | After the `form_submit` event there are no additional frontend logs (no page view, no API request tied to the user). | The interaction stopped right after the submit – a classic abandonment point. |

**Conclusion:** The anonymous user started a login flow but never completed it nor proceeded to any downstream action that would constitute a conversion. Therefore the session should be classified as a **drop‑off**.
