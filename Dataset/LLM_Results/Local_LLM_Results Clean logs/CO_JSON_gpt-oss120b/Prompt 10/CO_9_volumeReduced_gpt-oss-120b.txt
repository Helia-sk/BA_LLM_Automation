Prompt: Analyze the following log file. Determine if the session was a drop-off or a conversion. Provide a reason for your classification.
==================================================

**Classification:** **Conversion**

**Why this session is a conversion**

| Step | Method / Endpoint | What happened | HTTP status |
|------|-------------------|---------------|-------------|
| 1‑4  | `GET /api/customer/orders/` (request → response) | The client fetched the list of existing orders. | 200 |
| 5‑6  | `GET /api/customer/dashboard/orders/` (request → response) | The client opened the dashboard that shows order history. | 200 |
| 7‑8  | **`POST /api/customer/place_order`** (request → response) | The user submitted a new order. | **201** (Created) |
| 9‑10 | `OPTIONS /api/customer/place_order` (pre‑flight) | CORS pre‑flight for the POST – normal for browsers. | 200 |
| 11‑14| `GET /api/customer/orders/` (request → response) | After placing the order the client refreshed the orders list, now showing the newly created order. | 200 |

The decisive event is the **POST to `customer_place_order.place_order` that returned a 201 status code**. A 201 response means the server successfully created a new resource—in this case, a new customer order. That is the hallmark of a successful conversion (the user completed the intended purchase/action).

The subsequent GET requests that retrieve the updated order list further confirm that the system recognized the new order and that the session continued normally rather than terminating abruptly.

Therefore, the session represents a **conversion**, not a drop‑off.
