Prompt: Analyze the following log file. Determine if the session was a drop-off or a conversion. Provide a reason for your classification.
==================================================

**Classification:** **Conversion**

**Reasoning**

1. **Frontend activity** – The session (`session_1757771443548_7eqjj0e9b`) contains a series of user‑interaction events on the login page (`/customer/login`), culminating in a `form_submit` event. This shows the user attempted to log in.

2. **Backend confirmation of login** – Shortly after the `form_submit`, the logs record a `POST /api/customer/login` request that returns **status 200** (`customer_login.login`). This indicates the login was successful.

3. **Order placement** – Following the successful login, the backend logs a `POST /api/customer/place_order` request that returns **status 201** (`customer_place_order.place_order`). A 201 response means a new resource (the order) was created – i.e., the user placed an order.

4. **Post‑order verification** – Subsequent `GET /api/customer/orders/` calls return **status 200** with order data, confirming that the order now exists in the system.

5. **Overall flow** – The sequence moves from login attempt → successful authentication → order creation → order retrieval, which is the typical conversion funnel for an e‑commerce site.

Because the session ends with a successful order creation (HTTP 201) and the system returns the newly created order, the user completed the desired conversion rather than abandoning the process. Hence, the session is classified as a **conversion**.
