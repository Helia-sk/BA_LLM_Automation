Prompt: Analyze the following log file. Determine if the session was a drop-off or a conversion. Provide a reason for your classification.
==================================================

**Classification:** **Drop‑off**

**Why**

| Evidence | Interpretation |
|----------|----------------|
| The frontend logs (session `session_1757771443548_7eqjj0e9b`) show a series of user actions on the **/restaurant/login** page – input changes, clicks, and finally a **form_submit** event. | The user attempted to log in. |
| After the `form_submit` there is **no** backend log entry that records a successful login (`/api/login` POST returning 200) **linked to the same session**. | The server never returned a successful authentication response for this user. |
| The only backend login entries (`/api/login` POST 200) have `browser_id: "backend"` and `session_id: "backend"`, which belong to internal service calls, not the anonymous user session. | Those responses are unrelated to the anonymous user’s attempt. |
| No further activity (e.g., order retrieval, checkout, or navigation away from the login page) is recorded after the form submission. | The user did not complete the conversion flow. |

Because the user’s interaction stops at the form submission without a corresponding successful login response (or any subsequent conversion‑related actions), the session should be considered a **drop‑off** rather than a conversion.
