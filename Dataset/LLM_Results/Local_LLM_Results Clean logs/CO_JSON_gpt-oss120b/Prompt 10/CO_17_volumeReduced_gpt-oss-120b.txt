Prompt: Analyze the following log file. Determine if the session was a drop-off or a conversion. Provide a reason for your classification.
==================================================

**Classification:** **Conversion**

**Reasoning**

| Step | Endpoint / Action | Method | HTTP Status | What it tells us |
|------|-------------------|--------|-------------|------------------|
| 1‑4  | `cus_orders.get_customer_orders` | GET | 200 | The client successfully retrieved the list of orders – normal browsing behavior. |
| 5‑6  | `customer_place_order.get_order_history` | GET | 200 | The client fetched the order‑history/dashboard – still in the browsing/funnel stage. |
| 7‑8  | `customer_place_order.place_order` | POST | **201** | A **201 Created** response means the server successfully created a new order. This is the definitive signal that the user completed the purchase flow. |
| 9‑10 | `customer_place_order.place_order` | OPTIONS | 200 | Pre‑flight CORS check; does not affect the outcome. |

All requests completed without error (no 4xx/5xx codes) and the critical **POST** that creates an order returned **201**, which is the standard success code for a newly created resource (i.e., a placed order). Therefore the session reached the intended conversion point rather than abandoning the funnel.
