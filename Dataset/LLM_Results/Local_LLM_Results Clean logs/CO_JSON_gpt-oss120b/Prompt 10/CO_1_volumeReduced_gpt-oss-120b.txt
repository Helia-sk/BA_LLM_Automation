Prompt: Analyze the following log file. Determine if the session was a drop-off or a conversion. Provide a reason for your classification.
==================================================

**Classification:** **Conversion**

**Reasoning**

| Step | Evidence from the log | Interpretation |
|------|-----------------------|----------------|
| 1. User interaction on the login page | Multiple `input_change` and `click` events followed by a `form_submit` event (`event_name: "form_submit"`) in the frontend logs, all tied to the same `session_id: "session_1757771443548_7eqjj0e9b"` | The user filled out the login form and submitted it – a clear indication of attempting to complete the goal (login). |
| 2. Backend request generated | A `http_request` entry for `method: "POST"` to `/api/customer/login` (the API that processes the login) appears right after the frontend `form_submit`. | The submitted credentials were sent to the server. |
| 3. Backend response received | A corresponding `http_response` entry shows `status_code: 200` and a small `response_size: 82` for the same POST request. | A `200 OK` response from the login endpoint signals that the server successfully processed the login request (i.e., the user was authenticated). |
| 4. No error or abandonment signals | There are no subsequent `error`, `http_response` with 4xx/5xx, or additional navigation events that would indicate the user left the flow before completion. | The session does not exhibit typical drop‑off patterns. |

**Conclusion:** The sequence of a form submission followed by a successful (`200`) backend response to the login API demonstrates that the user achieved the intended conversion event (a successful login). Hence, the session should be classified as a **conversion**.
