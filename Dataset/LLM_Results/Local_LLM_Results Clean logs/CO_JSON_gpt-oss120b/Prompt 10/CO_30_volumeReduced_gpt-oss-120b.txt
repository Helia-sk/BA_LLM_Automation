Prompt: Analyze the following log file. Determine if the session was a drop-off or a conversion. Provide a reason for your classification.
==================================================

**Classification:** Drop‑off  

**Reasoning**

| Step | Endpoint / Action | HTTP Method | Status | Business implication |
|------|-------------------|------------|--------|----------------------|
| 1‑2  | `orders.reject_order` (`/api/orders/25/reject`) | POST | 200 | The order was **rejected** – the user explicitly declined / cancelled the transaction. |
| 3‑4  | `orders.reject_order` (OPTIONS) | OPTIONS | 200 | Pre‑flight request – no business event. |
| 5‑9  | `orders.get_orders` (`/api/orders/`) | GET | 200 | Simply fetching the list of orders – informational, not a conversion. |
| 10‑11| `orders.get_order_details` (`/api/orders/14/details`) | GET | 200 | Viewing details of an existing order – again, no purchase or completion. |
| 12‑17| Repeated `orders.get_orders` calls | GET | 200 | Re‑fetching the order list; still no state‑changing action. |

A **conversion** in an e‑commerce or order‑processing context would be represented by a successful, state‑changing request such as:

* `orders.create_order` (POST) that returns a success code,
* `orders.confirm_payment` / `orders.complete_order`,
* any endpoint that moves an order from a pending to a “completed” or “paid” status.

The only state‑changing request in this session is a **POST to reject an order**, which explicitly **cancels** the transaction rather than completing it. All other calls are read‑only (GET/OPTIONS) and simply retrieve data.

Because the session ends with no further action that would indicate a purchase or order fulfillment, it is best described as a **drop‑off** – the user (or system) left the flow without converting.
