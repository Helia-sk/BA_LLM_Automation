Prompt: Analyze the following log file. Determine if the session was a drop-off or a conversion. Provide a reason for your classification.
==================================================

**Classification:** Conversion  

**Reason:**  
The log sequence contains a `POST` request to **/api/customer/place_order** that returned a **201 Created** status (`attempt_id: c5ff48e0-25fc-4c04-bc97-7f5f6b3ddf2f`). A 201 response signifies that a new resource (the order) was successfully created, which is the hallmark of a successful purchase or sign‑up event.  

Following that, the session continues with requests for order details, the customer’s order list, and balance—typical post‑conversion activity (e.g., confirming the order, viewing receipt, checking remaining balance). The presence of this successful order‑creation request outweighs any earlier GET requests, indicating the user completed the intended conversion rather than dropping off.
