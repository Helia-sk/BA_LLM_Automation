Tag Analyzers

This folder contains tools for analyzing files and extracting specific tags or patterns using regex.

Files Overview

Core Analysis Scripts
- tag_analyzer.py - Main tag analysis script that scans files for specific patterns using regex
- run_tag_analyzer.py - Easy runner that reads settings and executes tag analysis
- batch_tag_analyzer.py - Batch processor that analyzes all subfolders in a parent directory

Configuration
- tag_settings.txt - Configuration file for tag analysis settings
- batch_tag_settings.txt - Configuration file for batch processing

Utilities
- run_tag_analyzer.bat - Windows batch file for easy running
- run_batch_tag_analyzer.bat - Windows batch file for batch processing

Quick Start

1. Configure Settings
Edit tag_settings.txt:
INPUT_FOLDER=path/to/your/input/files
OUTPUT_FILE=path/to/output/analysis_results.xlsx
TAG_PATTERN=Tag: Drop-Off

2. Run Analysis
python run_tag_analyzer.py

Or double-click run_tag_analyzer.bat on Windows.

For batch processing, edit batch_tag_settings.txt and run:
python batch_tag_analyzer.py

Features

Pattern Matching - Search for specific text patterns in files using regex
Excel Output - Generate Excel reports with analysis results
CSV Support - Also supports CSV output format
Batch Processing - Analyze entire directories and subfolders
Boolean Results - Clear true/false results for each file
Tag Classification - Automatically classifies tags as Conversion or Drop-Off

Requirements

Python 3.7+
Required packages: pandas, openpyxl

Usage Examples

Analyze Files for Drop-Off Tags
python tag_analyzer.py --input ./input_folder --output ./results.xlsx --pattern "Tag: Drop-Off"

Use Settings File
python run_tag_analyzer.py

Batch Process All Subfolders
python batch_tag_analyzer.py --parent ./parent_folder

Output Format

The analyzer creates an Excel file with:
- Filename - Name of the analyzed file
- Has_Tag - Boolean indicating if the pattern was found
- Tag_Type - Classification (Conversion, Drop-Off, None, etc.)

Batch processing creates individual reports per subfolder plus an overall summary.

Troubleshooting

1. File not found: Check input folder path in settings
2. Permission errors: Ensure output directory is writable
3. Excel errors: Install openpyxl with pip install openpyxl
4. Pattern not found: Check if the tag pattern is correct

Tag Analyzer Regex API LLM

The tag analyzer uses regex patterns to extract Tag: patterns from LLM output files. It searches for patterns like "Tag: Conversion" or "Tag: Drop-Off" in files, particularly after the </think> separator. The regex patterns handle various formats including case variations and markdown formatting.

Test Automation

The batch_tag_analyzer.py script automates testing by processing multiple subfolders containing DO/CO files. It analyzes each subfolder, creates individual Excel reports, and generates an overall summary with statistics comparing Conversion vs Drop-Off rates.

Local LLM Test Automation

This tool works with output files generated by Local LLM Test Automation. It analyzes the LLM-generated files to extract and classify tags, helping validate LLM output quality and consistency across test runs.
